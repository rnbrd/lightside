6,A2,n,n-A2,g,now down slightly to 
7,K2,n,n-K2,f,down the middle or straight 
7,K1,s,s-K1,g,slightly sloped slightly sloped that way 
8,K2,n,n-K2,f,to the towards the west or east

16,A2,n,n-A2,g,right down about three centimetres 
16,A1,s,s-A1,f,uh-huh 
17,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then slightly to the east that way and then turn to the west and like curve round like that except it'll be the other way 
17,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
18,o,n,n-o,g,and then

24,K1,s,s-K1,g,above the hills 
25,K2,n,n-K2,f,to the east of that or what 
25,K1,s,s-K1,g,to the east of that 
25,K1,s,s-K1,g,nearly to the end of the hills 
26,A1,n,n-A1,f,i'm just going straight down there then 
26,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
27,A1,n,n-A1,g,we're just going east 
28,K2,n,n-K2,g,have you passed like have you done the curvy bit 
28,K1,s,s-K1,f,well sort yeah 
28,o,s,s-o,g,right 
29,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then sort curve on to the east along the east 
30,K2,n,n-K2,f,how far down the page am i now 
29,A1,o,o-A1,f,okay 
30,K1,n,n-K1,g,ten centimetres 
31,o,n,n-o,f,east 
31,K2,s,s-K2,f,i just keep going east 
31,K1,s,s-K1,g,east 
31,K1,s,s-K1,g,to about couple centimetres off the top off the end of the hills 
32,K1,n,n-K1,f,we've probably got different hills 
32,o,s,s-o,f,okay that's me 
33,o,n,n-o,g,and 
33,A2,s,s-A2,g,then curve upwards 
33,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
34,A2,n,n-A2,g,back to the stream to where you c-- to where you cross the stream 
35,o,n,n-o,f,this big thing 
36,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you have like two black lines and then a big stream 
36,o,s,s-o,f,right 
36,K1,s,s-K1,f,i'll tell you what i've got i've got this bit of water from where the start is 
36,o,s,s-o,f,okay 
36,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh

37,o,s,s-o,g,right 
38,o,n,n-o,g,s-- 
39,K1,n,n-K1,f,and then it splits into two 
38,K2,o,o-K2,g,you've got crane bay 
38,o,s,s-o,g,at the top 
38,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
38,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
40,o,n,n-o,g,uh 
40,o,s,s-o,g,right 
40,K2,s,s-K2,g,and you've got like the two bits round two lines round crane bay 
40,K1,s,s-K1,f,uh-huh 
41,A2,n,n-A2,g,so you cross that go up go back up and cross that 
42,K2,n,n-K2,f,how far down the river bit 
42,K1,s,s-K1,g,about two centimetres from where the two lines meet more sort come into one 
43,A2,n,n-A2,f,describe what you've got 
43,o,s,s-o,g,right 
43,A1,s,s-A1,g,i've got i've got my forked stream on the page 
44,o,n,n-o,g,right 
44,K2,s,s-K2,g,have you got something saying forked stream 
44,K1,s,s-K1,f,i have 
44,K1,s,s-K1,f,halfway down 
45,A2,n,n-A2,g,right now go up to the left from that 
45,o,s,s-o,g,right 
45,o,s,s-o,g,okay 
46,A2,n,n-A2,g,follow the stream up 
46,ch,s,s-ch,f,but i thought we're starting at the top 
46,o,s,s-o,f,follow the stream to the fork 
46,o,s,s-o,g,yeah i know 
47,K1,n,n-K1,g,list-- i know this is me explaining what i've got 
47,o,s,s-o,f,oh alright okay 
48,K1,n,n-K1,g,on the page 
48,o,s,s-o,g,right 
49,K1,n,n-K1,g,and then when it gets to the top one bit of the stream goes up and one bit goes left and up 
49,o,s,s-o,f,one bit goes up 
50,K1,n,n-K1,g,it round crane bay 
51,K1,n,n-K1,f,mine just goes straight up goes like that into crane bay 
52,K2,n,n-K2,f,how do you cross it anyway 
52,K2,s,s-K2,f,have you got bridges 
52,K1,s,s-K1,g,no 
52,K1,s,s-K1,g,i don't have a bridge but maybe that's your bridge then that's how it's crossed 
53,K2,n,n-K2,g,you got a bridge 
53,K1,s,s-K1,f,up at the very very top at crane bay 
54,K2,n,n-K2,g,how many centimetres off the top of the page 
55,K1,n,n-K1,g,yeah that could be it 
56,K1,n,n-K1,f,but i've got a house just below that local residents 
56,o,s,s-o,g,yeah 
57,K1,n,n-K1,g,so have i 
58,K2,n,n-K2,f,so am i going on top of that or what 
58,o,s,s-o,g,mmhmm 
58,K2,s,s-K2,f,under it 
59,A2,n,n-A2,g,go up 
59,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
60,A2,n,n-A2,g,round the round to the le-- the left of the house 
60,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
61,A2,n,n-A2,g,and up to probably where your bridge is then 
61,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
62,o,n,n-o,g,right 
62,A2,s,s-A2,g,and then you go right 
63,K2,n,n-K2,f,over the bridge 
63,K1,s,s-K1,g,over the bridge 
63,ch,s,s-ch,g,well i don't know i don't have the bridge but it looks over the bridge 
63,o,s,s-o,f,uh-huh 
64,K2,n,n-K2,g,have you another bridge no 
64,K1,s,s-K1,f,not that side 
64,o,s,s-o,g,up near where that one is no 
65,A2,n,n-A2,g,well keep going right for about four centimetres 
66,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you have a wood 
66,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
67,K1,n,n-K1,g,you're roughly in line with the wood or slightly 
67,o,s,s-o,f,okay 
68,K1,n,n-K1,g,sort nearly the middle of the wood but not quite down a bit 
68,K1,s,s-K1,g,in the middle 
68,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm 
69,o,n,n-o,g,right 
69,A2,s,s-A2,g,now go down and round the forked stream 
69,o,s,s-o,f,quite a lot 
69,A2,s,s-A2,g,round the forked stream 'til you come to like about the m"" in stream ""
70,o,n,n-o,g,now 
70,K2,s,s-K2,g,do you have farmed land 
70,K1,s,s-K1,f,nope 
71,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you have a dead tree 
71,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
72,K2,n,n-K2,g,right in like where two streams meet you have a dead tree 
72,K1,s,s-K1,f,uh-huh 
73,o,n,n-o,g,right 
73,K2,s,s-K2,g,to the right of that across the stream there's a big bit of farmed land 
73,o,s,s-o,g,right 
73,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
74,K1,n,n-K1,g,about seven or eight centimetres along 
75,A2,n,n-A2,g,so what you've got to do now is like go round that 
76,K2,n,n-K2,f,in the the farmed land and the stream or round the whole thing 
76,K1,s,s-K1,g,no 
77,A2,n,n-A2,g,round the farmed land 
77,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
78,K2,n,n-K2,f,so way out to m-- east 
78,o,s,s-o,g,way out 'til about 
78,K1,s,s-K1,g,yeah 
79,A2,n,n-A2,g,to about two centimetres off the end the page 
79,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
80,A2,n,n-A2,g,then about four centimetres down 
80,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
81,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then back in again 
82,K1,n,n-K1,f,about in line with this dead tree 
83,A2,n,n-A2,g,so you're just below the dead tree 
83,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
84,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then you cross the stream so's that you are actually below the dead tree 
84,ch,s,s-ch,f,i don't actually have anything to cross it with but 
85,K1,n,n-K1,g,neither do i 
86,K1,n,n-K1,f,that's okay 
86,o,s,s-o,g,right 
87,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you have pine grove 
87,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
87,K1,s,s-K1,f,bottom right 
88,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you have a lagoon 
88,K1,s,s-K1,f,no 
89,K2,n,n-K2,f,oh where 
90,K1,n,n-K1,f,i've got green bay 
89,K1,o,o-K1,g,about the middle 
90,o,n,n-o,g,mm right 
91,K1,n,n-K1,f,oh yeah i've got lagoon yeah 
92,A2,n,n-A2,g,from where you are below the dead tree go straight down 'til you're in line with the lagoon 
93,K1,n,n-K1,f,straight down uh past the buried treasure 
93,ch,s,s-ch,g,which i don't have 
93,o,s,s-o,f,never mind 
92,A1,o,o-A1,f,okay 
94,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then go west 'til you nearly reach the lagoon 
94,o,s,s-o,g,right 
95,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then down round that to the bottom the tip of the lagoon 
96,o,n,n-o,g,right now 
96,K2,s,s-K2,g,do you have a rock fall 
96,K1,s,s-K1,f,no 
97,K2,n,n-K2,g,right you have green bay 
97,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
98,o,n,n-o,g,do you have ehm 
98,o,s,s-o,g,right 
98,K2,s,s-K2,g,green bay is a bay right see the top point of green bay the outer point 
99,K2,n,n-K2,f,the westerly one 
99,K1,s,s-K1,g,yeah 
99,K1,s,s-K1,g,westerly point the top the end bit of land 
98,K1,o,o-K1,f,mmhmm 
100,K2,n,n-K2,g,that like comes to a point right 
101,K2,n,n-K2,f,the bit that looks a bit like india or something 
101,K1,s,s-K1,g,yeah mmhmm 
101,o,s,s-o,g,right 
102,K1,n,n-K1,g,so you come from the bottom of the lagoon and you're wanting to go there but the wee 
103,K1,n,n-K1,g,if you look in the top line of green bay there's like a wee dent in it 
103,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm 
104,K1,n,n-K1,g,that's a rock fall of about three centimetres high 
104,o,s,s-o,f,okay 
105,A2,n,n-A2,g,so you have to come from the bottom of the lagoon over that and then down to the tip 
105,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
105,o,s,s-o,g,'kay 
106,o,n,n-o,g,now

108,K1,s,s-K1,g,yeah 
109,K2,n,n-K2,f,anywhere in this pirate ship 
109,K1,s,s-K1,g,the the west the front
