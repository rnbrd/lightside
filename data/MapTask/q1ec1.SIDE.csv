3,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
4,o,n,n-o,g,okay 
4,A2,s,s-A2,g,and then we're going to turn east 
4,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
5,A2,n,n-A2,g,not straight east slightly sort northeast 
5,o,s,s-o,f,s-- slightly northeast

7,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
8,K1,n,n-K1,g,and immediat-- well a distance below that turning point there's a fenced meadow 
9,A2,n,n-A2,g,but you should be avoiding that by quite a distance 
9,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
10,A2,n,n-A2,g,okay so we've turned and we're going up north again

12,o,s,s-o,f,okay 
13,A2,n,n-A2,g,and we're passing above the top of that 
13,A2,s,s-A2,g,we're going to continue in that sort s"" shape a big wide ""s"" ""
13,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
14,K1,n,n-K1,g,and on the sort mmhmm top erm left of that again below it there's a fenced meadow

16,o,n,n-o,g,right okay 
16,K2,s,s-K2,g,we've gone from the abandoned cottage right and we're on the sort s"" shape yeah ""
16,K1,s,s-K1,f,right 
17,o,n,n-o,g,right

20,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
21,A2,n,n-A2,g,and we're going to do that in a curve almost a half u"" shape ""

23,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
24,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then we're going to turn down ove-- above a trig point and we're going to turn immediately to your right and straight down at an angle of forty-five 
24,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
25,o,n,n-o,g,okay
