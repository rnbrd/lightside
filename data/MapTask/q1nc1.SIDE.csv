1,o,n,n-o,g,ehm right 
1,A2,s,s-A2,g,you start at the caravan park 
1,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
1,o,s,s-o,g,right 
2,A2,n,n-A2,g,ehm if you go down about three inches down uh-huh 
2,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
3,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then across about two and go back up in 
4,K2,n,n-K2,f,do i go past the picket fence 
4,K1,s,s-K1,g,no 
5,o,n,n-o,g,right okay 
5,o,s,s-o,g,we're going 
6,K2,n,n-K2,g,see the old mill can you find the old mill on your map 
6,K1,s,s-K1,f,the mill wheel 
6,ch,s,s-ch,g,it's an old mill 
6,ch,s,s-ch,f,i don't have an old mill it says mill wheel must be the same thing 
6,o,s,s-o,g,okay right 
7,o,n,n-o,f,so 
7,A1,s,s-A1,f,i go down from the caravan park bef-- turn right before the picket fence 
8,A2,n,n-A2,g,you go to the old mill 
7,ch,o,o-ch,g,there's no picket fence here eh 
9,K2,n,n-K2,f,you don't have a picket f-- 
9,K1,s,s-K1,f,i've a i've got a picket fence about three inches down from the caravan park 
10,A1,n,n-A1,f,so i need to stop short of that and turn right right and go and pass beneath the mill wheel or the old the old mill as you have it 
10,o,s,s-o,g,well 
10,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
11,A2,n,n-A2,g,i go down and then i turn right n-- no then i turn left and then i go back up past the old mill so it's like a curve it's like a curve going up down and then up again past the old 
12,K2,n,n-K2,g,have you got is old mill quite near the caravan park 
12,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
13,K1,n,n-K1,f,it's about i mean maybe an inch and a half or two inches southeast of it on mine 
13,o,s,s-o,g,mm 
14,K2,n,n-K2,g,and ha-- have you to go have you to go there like in you've not you've not to pass the ca-- you've not to pass that fence 
14,o,s,s-o,f,well 
14,K1,s,s-K1,f,if i went three inches down from the caravan park i would you know i'd more hit the picket fence 
14,o,s,s-o,g,so then 
14,o,s,s-o,g,right i see 
15,A2,n,n-A2,g,so is that the idea of this then so you you're going straight to where i am instead going round the picket fence 
16,A2,n,n-A2,g,if i say if i say that you've to go to the old mill first 
16,o,s,s-o,f,where's your 
17,K2,n,n-K2,f,actually go to it 
17,o,s,s-o,f,well 
17,K1,s,s-K1,g,mmhmm 
18,o,n,n-o,f,i you know i wouldn't have to really go down i could just i could just go you know down and to the right rather than go down and then turn right sort thing 
18,o,s,s-o,g,hmm 
19,A2,n,n-A2,g,but the idea is the idea so that you don't go there to the picket fence if i'm going to the old mill first 
19,o,s,s-o,f,wh-- where wh-- 
19,o,s,s-o,f,well 
19,ch,s,s-ch,f,i you i don't suppose you you you can go outside the picket fence 
20,A1,n,n-A1,f,eh i i could i could go down about you know two and a half inches and then go right and that would take me underneath my mill wheel right you know beneath it so that not not beneath it n-- on the map beneath it on the map 
20,o,s,s-o,g,right okay 
20,o,s,s-o,g,mmhmm 
21,o,n,n-o,f,you know 
21,A1,s,s-A1,f,so i can go down and then to the right and and you know another couple of inches and that's me below the mill wheel 
21,o,s,s-o,g,the old mill 
22,K2,n,n-K2,f,is that okay 
22,o,s,s-o,g,right 
23,K2,n,n-K2,g,can you can you s-- s-- can you s-- well can you see the abandoned cottage 
23,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
24,K1,n,n-K1,f,that's in the middle of my map right in the middle of the page 
24,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
25,o,n,n-o,g,so if mm 
25,A2,s,s-A2,g,so if you go to the old mill and then y-- 
26,K2,n,n-K2,f,i'd if i need to go beneath the old mill right 
25,A1,o,o-A1,f,okay 
26,K1,n,n-K1,g,uh-huh 
27,o,n,n-o,f,further along to the right and then up about six or seven inches 'til you get to the abandoned cottage so i d-- i do that do i 
27,o,s,s-o,g,mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm 
28,A2,n,n-A2,g,so you're going to your right old now going out to your right and then eh straight up to the round the abandoned cottage right 
28,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay so i right well 
29,K1,n,n-K1,f,i've not drawn anything yet 
30,A1,n,n-A1,f,i'll go down from the caravan park right 
30,o,s,s-o,g,mmhmm 
31,A1,n,n-A1,f,and then right 
32,K2,n,n-K2,g,is the point so that you it's not so that you d-- you avoid that that fence or have you got to go by that fence 
32,K1,s,s-K1,f,i've avoided the fence now 
32,o,s,s-o,g,right you have right 
33,A1,n,n-A1,f,i'm i'm going right under the the mill okay 
33,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
34,A1,n,n-A1,f,and up now 
34,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
35,A2,n,n-A2,g,you ma-- you're actually meant to over the mill 
35,o,s,s-o,f,over the mill 
35,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
36,K1,n,n-K1,g,as in on the left-hand side of it you know what i mean like going up round it on the map 
36,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm 
37,o,n,n-o,f,well 
37,K1,s,s-K1,f,my caravan park is on the left-hand side of the mill 
37,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
38,K1,n,n-K1,g,so is this 
38,o,s,s-o,g,right 
39,o,n,n-o,f,so i could ju-- 
40,K2,n,n-K2,g,it's on the it's on the far left isn't it 
40,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah my caravan park's on the far left 
40,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
41,K1,n,n-K1,f,but the mill wheel's to the right of it 
41,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh that's fine 
42,o,n,n-o,g,so if you you're going to the old mill 
43,K1,n,n-K1,f,first of all 
43,o,s,s-o,g,mmhmm 
44,K1,n,n-K1,f,it's the very first place i go 
44,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
45,o,n,n-o,f,well 
45,K2,s,s-K2,f,i can just draw a line straight between the two then 
45,o,s,s-o,f,right 
45,K1,s,s-K1,g,yeah but on my map it's not got that it's eh 
46,A2,n,n-A2,g,you're going in a sort curve to the bottom of the map then round the old mill 
46,o,s,s-o,f,round beneath the old mill 
46,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
46,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
47,A2,n,n-A2,g,you don't actually go under the old mill you go like round it 
48,o,n,n-o,g,like 
48,K2,s,s-K2,g,see the side where the steps are 
48,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
47,o,o,o-o,g,like 
47,A2,s,s-A2,g,that's how you go just just go round the top 
47,A1,s,s-A1,f,you actually go round the side where the where the wheel is 
47,ch,s,s-ch,g,no the other side 
47,o,s,s-o,f,the other side 
47,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
49,A2,n,n-A2,g,where where the steps are and round the r-- on top of the roof and then you go round to your right 
50,A2,n,n-A2,g,just keep going right then straight up round the abandoned cottage 
51,o,n,n-o,f,i mean 
51,K2,s,s-K2,f,surely you could just go you know you could just go straight from the caravan park to the abandoned cottage could you not 
51,K1,s,s-K1,g,no 
52,A2,n,n-A2,g,well o-- on the route on this map is you've to go down 
52,o,s,s-o,f,so right so 
52,A1,s,s-A1,f,i'd b-- i'd have to draw a curve then from the down from the caravan park 
52,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
53,A1,n,n-A1,f,from the mill wheel and up to the abandoned cottage to the right like a tick shape it'd be s-- the shape of a tick from the the 
53,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
54,A2,n,n-A2,g,the shape of a like an oval shape from the caravan park you start just above the caravans 
54,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
54,o,s,s-o,g,right 
54,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm 
55,A2,n,n-A2,g,ma-- make mark across above the caravans go round like just like an oval like half an until you come to sort top of the old mill like say the 
55,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
55,o,s,s-o,g,the corner of the roof 
56,K2,n,n-K2,f,then up to the abandoned cottage 
56,K1,s,s-K1,g,then uh-huh 
57,A2,n,n-A2,g,do a curve right up to your right 
57,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
57,o,s,s-o,f,right 
58,A1,n,n-A1,f,i'll draw that 
59,A2,n,n-A2,g,sort d-- gradual curve to your right 
59,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
60,o,n,n-o,g,eh 
61,K2,n,n-K2,f,where does it stop 
62,K2,n,n-K2,g,see where the fenced meadow is

64,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
63,K1,o,o-K1,g,when you go right from the old mill go right and just where eh that you start you come to the beginning of that drawing on the right go straight up round the abandoned cottage 
65,K2,n,n-K2,f,you're saying you go from the m-- the old mill to the fenced meadow 
65,K1,s,s-K1,g,no 
66,K1,n,n-K1,g,you go you're above the fenced meadow the the route is actually above that

68,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
69,A2,n,n-A2,g,and you're going make a gradual slope to your right 
69,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
70,o,n,n-o,g,okay 
71,K1,n,n-K1,f,quite steep though up the up the way

81,K1,s,s-K1,g,no 
82,o,n,n-o,f,surely 
82,o,s,s-o,g,no

88,o,s,s-o,g,let's start again in different terms 
89,K2,n,n-K2,g,see about three quarters of the way to your right in the page 
89,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
88,A2,o,o-A2,g,stop right when you've go-- drawn your line from the old mill and then just go straight up and make a line round the abandoned like a circle round the abandoned cottage 
90,A2,n,n-A2,g,curve round the abandoned cottage and round the roof 
90,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
91,K2,n,n-K2,f,back towards the left-hand side 
91,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh

92,o,n,n-o,f,right i've done that i've now got th-- 
93,o,n,n-o,g,and s-- 
92,K1,o,o-K1,f,i've now got three lines on my page but i know the one that 
93,o,n,n-o,g,well 
92,o,o,o-o,f,that will that would just 
94,K2,n,n-K2,g,it's meant to be a sort continuous curve is it not 
94,K1,s,s-K1,f,no 
95,K1,n,n-K1,f,but i mean that that's like this is the third attempt sort thing 
95,o,s,s-o,g,oh right i see

97,o,s,s-o,g,right 
98,A2,n,n-A2,g,go down say about forty-five degrees on a sort angle 
98,A1,s,s-A1,f,yeah 
99,o,n,n-o,g,down 
100,K2,n,n-K2,g,see where the fenced meadow is besi-- on the left-hand side of the r-- uh-huh the left-hand side of your page 
100,ch,s,s-ch,f,no m-- mine's 
101,K1,n,n-K1,g,about halfway up 
101,ch,s,s-ch,f,no that's not there on mine 
101,o,s,s-o,g,is it not 
102,K1,n,n-K1,f,my fenced meadow's at the bottom right-hand side

107,o,s,s-o,f,yeah 
108,K1,n,n-K1,f,but i had to though 
108,o,s,s-o,g,right okay 
109,K1,n,n-K1,g,may-- aye maybe that's what it is then 
110,o,n,n-o,g,oh right 
110,K2,s,s-K2,g,see where the see where your caravan park is then 
110,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
111,K1,n,n-K1,f,i've got nothing above it i've nothing above the caravan park 'til the the west lake 
112,K2,n,n-K2,g,have you got something below it 
112,K2,s,s-K2,g,have you got a ca-- have you got a fence below it 
112,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
112,K1,s,s-K1,f,the picket fence 
113,o,n,n-o,g,well 
113,K2,s,s-K2,g,did you go round it 
113,K1,s,s-K1,f,no 
114,K1,n,n-K1,f,i went over the mill the the picket fence er hasn't come into it right yet really 
115,o,n,n-o,g,di-- 
115,o,s,s-o,g,well 
115,o,s,s-o,g,see the caravan park 
115,K2,s,s-K2,g,i-- is there is there a picket fence underneath it 
115,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
116,o,n,n-o,g,well 
116,A2,s,s-A2,g,could you make a line go round it and then c-- 
117,K2,n,n-K2,g,is it bet-- is it like down and then the old mill's above from it 
117,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
118,K1,n,n-K1,f,the the old mill's like northeast of it 
119,K2,n,n-K2,g,so can you not go round the picket fence and round the old mill do you not have to go round the picket fence no 
119,K1,s,s-K1,f,i don't think so 
120,K1,n,n-K1,f,that that's what we did first of all th-- the the the first line 
120,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
120,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
121,K1,n,n-K1,f,when i was asking you whether i could you know i had to eh stop before i got to the picket fence or not so but 
122,o,n,n-o,g,well 
122,K2,s,s-K2,g,do you not have to go round it 
122,o,s,s-o,f,why just a fence 
123,K1,n,n-K1,g,it's it's not a picket fence here so the route must go round the picket fence surely 
124,o,n,n-o,f,you think so 
124,K1,s,s-K1,f,maybe it's the the route's to stay inside the picket fence 
124,o,s,s-o,g,well 
124,o,s,s-o,g,maybe it is okay as long as you're on the picket fence then i don't know 
125,K1,n,n-K1,f,i've got one d-- i've got one i don't know realise why it's there 
126,K2,n,n-K2,g,right right you went by the abandoned cottage right 
127,K1,n,n-K1,f,i'm above the chimney just now 
127,o,s,s-o,g,right you're above the chimney 
128,A2,n,n-A2,g,and if you start going dow-- in an angle about forty-five degrees down 
128,A1,s,s-A1,f,mm mmhmm 
129,A2,n,n-A2,g,to the to where the bottom of the abandoned cottage 
129,o,s,s-o,g,right 
129,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
130,o,n,n-o,g,'til oh right so

130,o,s,s-o,g,right uh-huh 
131,K2,n,n-K2,g,but wh-- is there anything on your map beside that then on your left-hand side 
131,K1,s,s-K1,f,no i've got noth-- no i've got nothing between the caravan park and the west lake on the left-hand side 
132,o,n,n-o,g,well 
132,A2,s,s-A2,g,if you make a sort like a a forty-five degree angle right for about a couple of inches or something and then you start making a circle you know what if you know what i mean if you've got does a sort angle then sort curve round 
133,K2,n,n-K2,g,have you got a west lake 
133,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
134,K1,n,n-K1,f,it's at the top left 
135,A2,n,n-A2,g,well can you can you make a sort curve then if after your angle sort like towards the west lake 
135,o,s,s-o,f,a curve 
136,K2,n,n-K2,f,whe-- where's your fenced meadow on the left-hand side 
136,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
136,o,s,s-o,g,sort like you've gone 
136,o,s,s-o,g,mm 
137,K2,n,n-K2,f,where's your fenced meadow on the left-hand side 
137,K1,s,s-K1,g,it's about halfway up the page that's wh-- uh-huh it's just about about halfway up the page 
138,K2,n,n-K2,f,so would you know head sort for the west lake now avoiding you know 
139,A2,n,n-A2,g,so if you s-- imagine a fenced meadow in the middle of the page 
140,A2,n,n-A2,g,and you sort make a circle round up towards the west lake you go up to the west lake and then 
140,A1,s,s-A1,f,yeah 
141,K1,n,n-K1,f,along the left-hand side of the page 
141,o,s,s-o,g,mmhmm 
141,o,s,s-o,f,right 
142,A1,n,n-A1,f,right up to the top 
142,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
143,A2,n,n-A2,g,you go ri-- you make a a ci-- you make a line up go up 
143,o,s,s-o,g,right 
143,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
144,A2,n,n-A2,g,to the ti-- 'til you reach the west lake 
145,K2,n,n-K2,g,see the curve in the at the bottom of the west lake 
145,K1,s,s-K1,f,right yeah 
146,K2,n,n-K2,g,that sort can you see a round curve 
146,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
147,A2,n,n-A2,g,go to the the eh furthest point of that like in your left-hand side right about the bottom of that curve 
147,A1,s,s-A1,f,yeah okay 
148,A2,n,n-A2,g,and start curving round it 
148,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
149,o,n,n-o,g,ti-- if you if you s-- 
149,K2,s,s-K2,g,can you see a trig point 
149,K1,s,s-K1,f,no 
149,o,s,s-o,g,no 
150,o,n,n-o,g,ehm 
150,K2,s,s-K2,g,right have you got the eh the west lake 
151,A2,n,n-A2,g,so make a curve round the bottom of that curve right so just follow that curve 
151,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
152,A2,n,n-A2,g,around west lake up to the just up to the point you know 
153,K2,n,n-K2,g,can you see on the west lake where it goes sort straight 
153,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
154,K1,n,n-K1,f,on the left-hand side 
154,o,s,s-o,g,no oh 
154,o,s,s-o,g,right 
155,K2,n,n-K2,f,where's your trig point 
156,K2,n,n-K2,f,do you cross the lake or do you go round it 
157,A2,n,n-A2,g,just just just go round 
157,o,s,s-o,g,right 
158,o,n,n-o,g,until about 
158,o,s,s-o,g,trying to think wh-- 
158,o,s,s-o,g,see right can you not 
159,K2,n,n-K2,g,see if there's a circle at the bottom know how you've just gone round it 
159,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
160,A2,n,n-A2,g,and you keep going up 'til about it's a kind sh-- there's kind of angle 
160,o,s,s-o,g,oh this is really hard 
161,K2,n,n-K2,g,see where the farmed land is at the top 
161,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
162,K1,n,n-K1,f,but that's at the at the right-hand side of my west lake 
162,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh it's at the right-hand side 
163,K1,n,n-K1,f,yeah but i'm at the bottom left-hand side of the lake at the moment 
163,o,s,s-o,g,right well 
164,K2,n,n-K2,g,so are you at the bottom left-hand 
164,o,s,s-o,g,right 
164,K1,s,s-K1,f,i've just curved round the bottom 
165,A2,n,n-A2,g,and and you can cu-- you curve round the bottom and keep going up that curve just curve round that 
165,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
166,A1,n,n-A1,f,so right round the top of the page 
166,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
166,o,s,s-o,f,that's a-- no 
167,K1,n,n-K1,f,i'd have to otherwise i'd be in the lake 
168,K2,n,n-K2,g,se-- can you see a monument 
168,K1,s,s-K1,f,the monument's on the right-hand side 
168,o,s,s-o,g,yeah 
169,K1,n,n-K1,f,not all that far from the abandoned cottage in fact 
169,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh that's what i mean 
170,K2,n,n-K2,g,and is the nuclear test site above it 
170,K1,s,s-K1,f,no 
171,K1,n,n-K1,f,i don't have a nuclear test site 
172,K1,n,n-K1,f,i've got a golf course 
173,K2,n,n-K2,f,have you got a golf course 
173,K1,s,s-K1,g,no 
173,o,s,s-o,f,no 
173,o,s,s-o,g,right 
174,o,n,n-o,g,have you got 
175,K1,n,n-K1,f,the golf course is just beneath the east lake about an inch or so down 
175,o,s,s-o,g,is it 
175,o,s,s-o,f,yeah 
176,K2,n,n-K2,g,up from its furthest point 
176,K1,s,s-K1,f,no 
177,K1,n,n-K1,f,from eh okay it's about two inches down from where it says east lake in the lake 
177,o,s,s-o,g,right 
178,K1,n,n-K1,f,there's a golf course it's not that big 
179,A2,n,n-A2,g,so you want want you want to go round the golf course then i think 
179,o,s,s-o,f,well 
180,A2,n,n-A2,f,let's get round the lake first the west lake 
180,o,s,s-o,f,so 
181,o,n,n-o,g,right 
182,K1,n,n-K1,f,i mean then then that's how i i'd need to go right round the top 
183,K2,n,n-K2,g,i take it they're the same shape on the maps then 
183,K1,s,s-K1,f,they must be 
183,o,s,s-o,g,right 
184,K1,n,n-K1,f,towards the top of the page unless i cross unless i cross the lake i'd need to go right round it 
184,o,s,s-o,g,right 
185,o,n,n-o,g,west lake isn't exac-- 
185,K1,s,s-K1,g,you don't want to cross the lake 
186,K2,n,n-K2,f,but how am i going to get to the farmland or any-- or anything else 
186,ch,s,s-ch,g,you don't want to go to the farmed land 
187,K1,n,n-K1,g,i just asked if i had if you had farmed land 
188,K1,n,n-K1,f,so i've to double back on myself 
188,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
189,o,n,n-o,f,so what do where 
189,o,s,s-o,f,right 
189,K2,s,s-K2,f,i'm at the bottom of west lake 
189,o,s,s-o,f,right 
190,K2,n,n-K2,f,the left-hand side 
190,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
191,K2,n,n-K2,f,where do i go now 
191,o,s,s-o,g,right 
192,A2,n,n-A2,g,you you you curve round 
192,o,s,s-o,g,right 
193,K1,n,n-K1,g,see west lake you can see the curves can't you round west lake 
194,K2,n,n-K2,f,along the left-hand side 
194,K1,s,s-K1,g,on the left-hand side right 
194,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm 
195,o,n,n-o,g,right 
195,K2,s,s-K2,g,you've just come up from the abandoned cottage right 
195,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
196,K2,n,n-K2,g,and you've gone straight up 
196,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
197,K1,n,n-K1,g,to the bottom of west lake 
198,K2,n,n-K2,g,see directly underneath it where it says west lake 
198,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
198,o,s,s-o,f,oh 
199,K1,n,n-K1,f,i didn't actually i didn't actually go there 
200,K2,n,n-K2,g,see the see see whe-- west lake see where the e"" is ""
200,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
200,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm 
201,K1,n,n-K1,g,directly under that you can then you see a curve going round to your right it's like a sort bottom of a circle or something it's quite it's quite rounded 
201,o,s,s-o,f,yeah i know the i know the bit y-- 
202,K1,n,n-K1,f,the bottom right-hand side this is you're talking about 
202,o,s,s-o,g,mmhmm 
203,K1,n,n-K1,f,you you talking about the e"" in lake ""
203,o,s,s-o,g,mmhmm 
203,o,s,s-o,f,right 
204,K1,n,n-K1,g,oh god i forgot about that 
204,o,s,s-o,g,right 
205,A2,n,n-A2,g,you go down and just start 
205,o,s,s-o,g,right 
206,K2,n,n-K2,g,see where the e"" in lake is right and ""
207,A2,n,n-A2,g,go down to the bottom of that start tracing around that then towards your right 
208,K2,n,n-K2,f,we're going right now 
208,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
209,K2,n,n-K2,g,oh sorry have you been going right up the other side 
209,K1,s,s-K1,f,i thought we were 
210,K1,n,n-K1,f,i thought you were going left 
210,o,s,s-o,g,no 
211,K1,n,n-K1,g,we're going right 
212,K2,n,n-K2,f,so we're going from the abandoned cottage to below where it says lake 
212,K1,s,s-K1,g,right 
213,K2,n,n-K2,g,you've got you right you went to the abandoned cottage and you did a sort circle 
213,K1,s,s-K1,f,right i've done that now 
214,A1,n,n-A1,f,and i and then i trace it back round 
214,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay i'm doing that now 
214,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh you are 
215,A2,n,n-A2,g,and you're going round 
215,A1,s,s-A1,f,around the bottom right-hand corner okay 
215,o,s,s-o,g,yeah 
216,A2,n,n-A2,g,round the curve and then up 
216,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
216,o,s,s-o,g,round that curve and then up 
217,K2,n,n-K2,g,and you don't have a trig point 
217,K1,s,s-K1,f,no 
218,K1,n,n-K1,f,i've got all these lines on my on my map now 
219,K2,n,n-K2,g,see ehm where you've curved up from west lake do you know where i'm talking about see how there's a kind sharp turn to the left 
218,o,o,o-o,f,that don't apply 
219,K1,n,n-K1,f,yeah 
219,o,s,s-o,g,in west lake 
220,K2,n,n-K2,f,at the top of the lake 
220,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
220,o,s,s-o,f,yeah 
221,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then you go down there's a kind a bit you go straight down and then you go back up again 
221,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
221,o,s,s-o,g,if you can follow this 
222,o,n,n-o,g,right so you've went round the corner right 
222,A2,s,s-A2,g,start again 
222,A1,s,s-A1,f,the bottom right okay 
223,K2,n,n-K2,g,and see wh-- how i just said how it goes straight up and it goes down and it goes up 
223,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
224,K2,n,n-K2,g,see that bit that goes up 
224,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
225,K2,n,n-K2,g,the first time 
225,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
226,K2,n,n-K2,g,sort sharp bit 
226,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
227,o,n,n-o,g,right 
227,A2,s,s-A2,g,stop following the curve at the bottom of that 
227,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
228,o,n,n-o,g,okay 
228,o,s,s-o,g,and see when you get to that 
228,A2,s,s-A2,g,do an angle follow that 
229,K2,n,n-K2,g,see that sort straight angle 
229,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
230,A2,n,n-A2,g,do a straight line going to your towards your your right down to the left-hand side you're going down 
231,K2,n,n-K2,f,down to the right to my left-hand side 
231,K1,s,s-K1,g,right okay 
232,K1,n,n-K1,g,if d-- if you think of a compass so if it would be your ehm eh southwest 
233,K1,n,n-K1,f,but i'd be in the lake then 
233,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
234,K1,n,n-K1,g,you wouldn't be in the lake you shouldn't 
235,K2,n,n-K2,f,i stop drawing the curve right 
235,K1,s,s-K1,g,mmhmm 
236,K2,n,n-K2,g,you haven't gone right round the lake have you 
236,K1,s,s-K1,f,no 
237,K1,n,n-K1,f,i i started from the e"" in the lake ""
237,o,s,s-o,f,right 
238,K1,n,n-K1,f,and eh traced it round the right-hand side and and up the side of west lake 
238,o,s,s-o,f,okay 
238,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
239,K1,n,n-K1,f,and i've stopped where the first eh the first bit rises 
239,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
240,K1,n,n-K1,f,at quite a sharp angle i've stopped at th-- at the r-- the right-hand side of that 
240,o,s,s-o,g,the bottom of that 
240,o,s,s-o,f,yeah 
241,o,n,n-o,g,well 
241,o,s,s-o,g,then you're going t-- 
242,K2,n,n-K2,f,how can i go southwest i uh i'd surely be in the lake 
241,A2,o,o-A2,g,oh east sorry 
241,A1,s,s-A1,f,southeast right okay 
241,o,s,s-o,g,sorry right uh-huh right 
241,o,s,s-o,g,god it's my directions 
243,A2,n,n-A2,g,you go east southeast down 
244,K2,n,n-K2,f,where to 
244,K1,s,s-K1,g,straight 
245,K2,n,n-K2,g,have you do you should have a monument 
246,K2,n,n-K2,f,where's the nuclear test site 
245,K1,o,o-K1,f,yeah 
245,o,s,s-o,g,right great 
247,o,n,n-o,g,right 
247,A2,s,s-A2,g,go down there straight and go right and 
248,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you see where the monument is 
249,A2,n,n-A2,g,do a straight line to the monument 
249,o,s,s-o,f,straight to the monument 
250,A2,n,n-A2,g,to the bottom of the monument and curve round the monument just now 
250,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
251,o,n,n-o,f,and go up again 
251,A2,s,s-A2,g,and then you're starting to go up uh-huh go up a bit 
251,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
252,K2,n,n-K2,f,where's the nuclear test site 
252,K1,s,s-K1,g,eh it's just it's almost straight up from the monument a few in-- a few inches 
253,K2,n,n-K2,f,so it's be-- next to the golf course then 
253,ch,s,s-ch,g,i don't know where your golf course is 
254,K1,n,n-K1,g,it's just it's about an inch under the east lake at the bottom of east lake 
254,o,s,s-o,f,yeah 
255,K1,n,n-K1,f,the golf course is is fairly near there 
256,o,n,n-o,f,so right i 
256,A1,s,s-A1,f,i'm going down 
256,o,s,s-o,f,okay 
257,K1,n,n-K1,g,so you've got the monument 
257,o,s,s-o,f,yeah i'm going 
258,A2,n,n-A2,g,just go st-- down straight line down underneath the monument 
258,A1,s,s-A1,f,right and 
259,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then up t-- curve up 
259,o,s,s-o,f,come back up again 
259,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
260,A2,n,n-A2,g,eh go left for a couple of for about an inch or something 
260,o,s,s-o,g,okay 
261,K2,n,n-K2,f,how far do i go up here 
262,K2,n,n-K2,f,so i i g-- i i go left beneath the nuclear test site 
262,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
263,A2,n,n-A2,g,you want to stay on the left-hand side uh-huh 
263,o,s,s-o,f,sorry 
263,A2,s,s-A2,g,you want to stay on the left-hand side 
263,o,s,s-o,g,right 
264,A2,n,n-A2,g,you go round the monument 
264,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
265,o,n,n-o,f,and go left 
265,A2,s,s-A2,g,and s-- go left 
266,K1,n,n-K1,f,i've i've gone an inch or so up from the monument 
267,A2,n,n-A2,g,go left 
267,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
268,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then go straight up towards the east lake 
269,K2,n,n-K2,f,so i go left along the left-hand side of the golf course 
269,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
270,K2,n,n-K2,f,what bit of east lake do i go up to 
270,K1,s,s-K1,g,just go straight up to east lake when you've curved round the monument and where the golf course'll be sort curve 
270,o,s,s-o,f,i can imagine 
271,o,n,n-o,f,see where the see where the 
270,o,o,o-o,g,nuclear test site is 
271,K2,n,n-K2,f,the the left-hand side of the east lake at the bottom right 
272,K1,n,n-K1,f,if you draw a straight line down there that's the edge of the golf course so i can't go any i can't you know 
273,A2,n,n-A2,g,to the left-hand side of east lake like the very far end of east lake 
273,ch,s,s-ch,f,i can't 
273,o,s,s-o,f,yeah 
274,K1,n,n-K1,f,at the bottom 
275,K1,n,n-K1,f,i can't go any further left sorry further right than that because i've been i c-- i'd need to go through the golf course so i've actually you know that's where i am now more been-- beneath that point because that's the like the 
276,K1,n,n-K1,g,but that's where you're meant to end up underneath east lake 
277,K2,n,n-K2,f,at at the left-hand side 
277,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
278,K2,n,n-K2,f,at the bottom 
278,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
279,o,n,n-o,f,so i just go from there now 
279,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
280,K1,n,n-K1,g,that's the finish 
280,o,s,s-o,f,yeah i 
281,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you know where the farmed land is 
281,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah the farmed land's between east and west lake 
281,o,s,s-o,g,yeah 
282,A2,n,n-A2,g,you go well your finish point's just beside east lake 
282,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm right okay 
283,K2,n,n-K2,g,so if you went have you went round curved round the monument 
283,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah yeah i've done that 
284,K1,n,n-K1,f,i i'm at the finish now 
285,K2,n,n-K2,g,are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've we-- you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake t-- 
285,K1,s,s-K1,f,i've not done that yet 
286,K2,n,n-K2,g,see where east lake is 
287,K1,n,n-K1,f,you didn't say that 
286,K1,o,o-K1,f,yeah 
288,K1,n,n-K1,f,i'm at the i'm at the bottom left of east lake now 
288,o,s,s-o,f,right 
289,A1,n,n-A1,f,and so i curve round 
290,K2,n,n-K2,g,are you talking about the very bottom 
290,K2,s,s-K2,g,you talking about the bottom right 
290,K1,s,s-K1,f,the bottom left

291,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
292,A2,n,n-A2,g,but you're supposed to curve underneath there to about halfway you're meant to like sort draw a line following that line to about halfway and then go down round past the monument past your golf course i think as well 
293,A2,n,n-A2,g,maybe you go round your golf course 
293,o,s,s-o,f,well

298,o,s,s-o,g,right that's finish point so 
299,A2,n,n-A2,g,the line should be between that then 
300,K2,n,n-K2,f,between the golf course and the nuclear test site 
300,K1,s,s-K1,g,it's the golf course right it's underneath east lake and it's eh northwest from the monument 
300,o,s,s-o,f,yeah 
300,o,s,s-o,f,yeah mmhmm
