1,A2,n,n-A2,g,starting at the beginning head due south 
2,K1,n,n-K1,g,you'll see a diamond on your map 
2,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm 
1,A1,o,o-A1,f,due south 
3,A2,n,n-A2,g,going due south followed by east 
3,o,s,s-o,f,to the west 
3,o,s,s-o,g,east right 
4,K2,n,n-K2,f,so you want me to go east then south 
4,K1,s,s-K1,g,no 
5,K1,n,n-K1,g,south then east 
6,K1,n,n-K1,g,we may have a different map 
6,o,s,s-o,f,uh-huh right 
7,A2,n,n-A2,g,can you head due south 
7,o,s,s-o,f,sorry 
7,A2,s,s-A2,g,can you head due south 
7,A1,s,s-A1,f,i can head due south 
8,K2,n,n-K2,f,am i meant i'm meant to draw this on aren't i right 
8,o,s,s-o,f,yes 
8,K1,s,s-K1,g,go for it 
9,K2,n,n-K2,f,how far 
9,K1,s,s-K1,g,you'll see a graveyard 
10,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you 
10,K1,s,s-K1,f,no 
10,o,s,s-o,g,right 
11,K1,n,n-K1,g,they've obviously not marked the graveyard 
12,K2,n,n-K2,f,how far to the right of diamond is it 
13,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you have carved stones 
13,K1,s,s-K1,f,i have carved stones at top followed by a ravine followed by an indian country 
13,o,s,s-o,g,right 
14,K1,n,n-K1,g,in the diamond and the carved stones is the graveyard that's where it should be 
14,o,s,s-o,f,right 
15,A2,n,n-A2,g,so what you need to do is continue past the diamond then past where you think the graveyard is 
16,A2,n,n-A2,f,and then stop 
15,o,o,o-o,f,past where it is 
15,o,s,s-o,g,yeah 
17,A2,n,n-A2,g,go rou-- same under under the graveyard south of the graveyard 
18,K2,n,n-K2,f,is the graveyard due east of the diamond 
18,o,s,s-o,g,the 
18,K1,s,s-K1,g,correct 
18,o,s,s-o,g,correct 
18,o,s,s-o,f,right okay 
19,A2,n,n-A2,g,s-- you then come no-- up north just to the left to west of the carved stones 
19,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
20,K1,n,n-K1,g,so if you're almost on top of carved stones then you'll totally miss the graveyard 
20,o,s,s-o,f,okay 
21,K2,n,n-K2,f,right so i am now just directly north of the carved stones and slightly north of the start 
21,K1,s,s-K1,g,that's correct 
22,A2,n,n-A2,g,so you move east around carved stones 
22,o,s,s-o,f,the carved stones 
23,K2,n,n-K2,g,and then do you have gallows on your map 
23,K1,s,s-K1,f,yes 
24,K1,n,n-K1,f,but they're absolutely miles away 
24,o,s,s-o,g,that's correct that's correct 
25,A2,n,n-A2,g,all you need to do is go due south from the carved stones as far as you can see the gallows the same level as the gallows 
25,o,s,s-o,f,past 
25,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
26,K2,n,n-K2,g,you should be on top of the indian country correct 
26,K1,s,s-K1,f,um and just south of the ravine 
26,o,s,s-o,g,that's right 
27,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you have a great rock 
27,o,s,s-o,f,i 
28,K1,n,n-K1,g,it's to the west of indian country 
28,ch,s,s-ch,f,no 
29,K1,n,n-K1,f,it's very very southwest of indian country 
29,o,s,s-o,g,right 
30,K1,n,n-K1,g,that's a different great rock 
31,o,n,n-o,g,okay what you have to do is 
31,o,s,s-o,g,now that you're paral-- parallel with the gallows right 
31,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm 
31,K2,s,s-K2,g,you're on a level with the gallows 
31,K1,s,s-K1,f,i'm on a level 
32,A2,n,n-A2,g,head southwest that's to the left and down past indian country 
32,o,s,s-o,f,move west followed by south down to 
32,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
32,A2,s,s-A2,g,s-- straight southwest 
32,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
33,A2,n,n-A2,g,not too far 
33,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
34,K1,n,n-K1,f,i'm just below indian country 
35,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you see the gold 
35,o,s,s-o,g,do you see the gold 
36,K2,n,n-K2,f,which is due we-- due west 
36,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
35,K1,o,o-K1,f,yeah 
37,A2,n,n-A2,g,i want you to go 
37,o,s,s-o,g,understand 
37,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
38,A2,n,n-A2,g,but n-- not too far north 'cause otherwise you'll hit the rock so i want you to head just above the gold 
38,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
39,K2,n,n-K2,g,are you above the gold now 
39,o,s,s-o,f,i'm 
39,K2,s,s-K2,g,just to the west of it 
39,K1,s,s-K1,f,just i'm just to the east of it 
40,o,n,n-o,f,do you want me to go f-- slightly further 
40,o,s,s-o,g,yeah 
40,A2,s,s-A2,g,i want you to go just past it 
40,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
41,K1,n,n-K1,g,so you're basically in the gap between the gallows and the gold 
41,o,s,s-o,f,and the gold right 
42,A2,n,n-A2,g,and i want you to go due sou-- 
43,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you have a trout farm 
43,K1,s,s-K1,f,yes 
44,o,n,n-o,f,but 
43,o,o,o-o,g,right 
44,o,n,n-o,f,it's 
44,K1,s,s-K1,f,that is coming due south followed by due east just above the totem pole just above the totem pole if you had the totem pole 
44,o,s,s-o,g,that's correct i think 
45,A2,n,n-A2,g,want you to head due south as far south as the trout farm just below the trout farm 
45,o,s,s-o,f,just above the trout farm 
45,ch,s,s-ch,g,b-- just below the trout farm 
45,o,s,s-o,f,right 
46,K1,n,n-K1,f,i'm i think i'm just below the trout farm 
47,A2,n,n-A2,g,and head east 
47,o,s,s-o,f,east 
46,o,o,o-o,f,and land just below the trout farm 
48,K2,n,n-K2,g,ah do you have any other obstacles 
48,K1,s,s-K1,f,none 
48,o,s,s-o,g,in the way 
49,A2,n,n-A2,g,well head due east just below the trout farm trying to avoid any obstacles on your way 
49,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
50,K1,n,n-K1,f,i'm just below it directly below it i'm not east or west of it 
50,o,s,s-o,g,right 
51,K1,n,n-K1,g,now i've got a cavalry stockade on this map 
51,o,s,s-o,f,a cavalry a cattle stockade 
51,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
52,K1,n,n-K1,g,cavalry it's a fort thing 
52,o,s,s-o,f,right 
53,A2,n,n-A2,g,so we need to avoid that 
53,ch,s,s-ch,f,well we don't 
54,o,n,n-o,g,which means 
55,K2,n,n-K2,f,is it directly south 
55,K1,s,s-K1,g,it's almost south of the sou-- the trout farm it's south and slightly to the east 
55,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm 
56,A2,n,n-A2,g,so i want you to go right past the trout farm almost to the edge of the map to make sure we miss it 
56,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
57,K1,n,n-K1,g,so you're past your totem pole there as well you're 
57,o,s,s-o,g,that's all right 
58,o,n,n-o,g,right 
58,A2,s,s-A2,g,i want you to go due south now 
59,K2,n,n-K2,f,how far 
60,K2,n,n-K2,g,ehm do you have a cattle stockade 
60,K1,s,s-K1,f,i do 
61,K1,n,n-K1,f,just above it 
61,o,s,s-o,g,right 
62,A2,n,n-A2,g,just below it you want to go round the bottom of it 
63,K2,n,n-K2,f,do you want me to go to the bottom of the page 
63,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh that's correct 
64,o,n,n-o,f,right 
64,A2,s,s-A2,g,i want you to go west below the stockade 
65,K2,n,n-K2,f,and below the parched river bed which i don't know if you have 
65,ch,s,s-ch,g,although oh i don't have a river bed so 
66,o,n,n-o,g,is your river bed 
66,K2,s,s-K2,g,whereabouts is level becau-- 
67,K2,n,n-K2,f,do you have a bandit territory 
67,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
64,o,o,o-o,f,directly bas-- directly we-- west of your cattle stockade 
64,o,s,s-o,g,correct 
68,K2,n,n-K2,f,that's in the middle of the two 
68,K1,s,s-K1,g,right 
69,K1,n,n-K1,g,my map deviates here so presume that's why you must have an obstacle 
70,A2,n,n-A2,g,so what i want to do is go west as far left as the sta-- s-- just the edge of the c"" of the s-- cattle stockade ""
70,o,s,s-o,f,m-- 
70,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
71,K2,n,n-K2,g,then do you have to go up to avoid the 
71,K1,s,s-K1,f,well if there's a very very thin line i ca-- i can go up though yes 
71,o,s,s-o,g,because that's how this map indicates 
72,A2,n,n-A2,g,so i want you to go up not straight up ehm northwest 
72,A1,s,s-A1,f,i can go north then west 
72,o,s,s-o,g,up up in a curve 
73,A2,n,n-A2,g,i want you to go northwest in a one-er 
73,A1,s,s-A1,f,right will i go in a one-er 
73,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
74,K1,n,n-K1,g,it's a curve curve shape 
74,o,s,s-o,f,right you want me to curve 
75,o,n,n-o,f,where t-- where am i curving to 
75,A2,s,s-A2,g,curving up to the northwest followed by down to the southwest 
75,o,s,s-o,f,so you 
76,A2,n,n-A2,g,s-- so i want you to go basically curve up and then down 
77,K2,n,n-K2,f,you want me to go you want to curve up to about the level of the great rock i don't know if you have that 
77,K1,s,s-K1,g,no 
77,K1,s,s-K1,g,not as far as that 
77,o,s,s-o,f,see m-- 
78,K1,n,n-K1,g,only a small curve 
78,o,s,s-o,f,oh okay 
79,A2,n,n-A2,g,to about the m-- the middle of the fencing of the sto-- cattle stockade 
80,K2,n,n-K2,f,north east 
80,K1,s,s-K1,g,northwest to the left of the page 
80,o,s,s-o,f,okay 
81,K2,n,n-K2,f,and then curve back down to the bottom of the page 
81,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh that's correct 
82,K2,n,n-K2,g,'cause presumably we must be avoiding the river is that correct 
82,K1,s,s-K1,f,yeah 
83,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then we go due west along the bottom under the bandit territory 
83,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
84,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then curve round and up to the finish 
85,K2,n,n-K2,g,do you have finish on your map 
85,K1,s,s-K1,f,i don't have a finish 
86,K1,n,n-K1,f,above my bandit territory about an inch i have a great rock followed by two inches then a totem pole 
86,o,s,s-o,g,right 
87,A2,n,n-A2,g,keep going past the bandit terri-- territory 
87,o,s,s-o,f,due north 
88,K2,n,n-K2,g,are due west of the bandit territory yet 
88,K1,s,s-K1,f,i am now west of bandit territory 
88,o,s,s-o,g,right 
89,A2,n,n-A2,g,continue until you're about an inch two inches away from the edge of the page 
89,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
90,A2,n,n-A2,g,and curve up to it the point just above the s-- cactus of the bandit terri-- territory 
90,o,s,s-o,g,understand 
90,o,s,s-o,f,just dire-- 
91,K1,n,n-K1,g,so on the level 
92,K2,n,n-K2,f,just basically right above it but not touching it 
92,K1,s,s-K1,g,no 
93,K1,n,n-K1,g,the level of it but about an inch two inches in from the page 
93,o,s,s-o,f,alright 
93,o,s,s-o,g,understand what i mean 
94,K2,n,n-K2,f,right so basically just due north to the level of the 
94,K1,s,s-K1,g,correct 
94,o,s,s-o,f,right 
95,K1,n,n-K1,g,and that's your x"" that's your finish ""
95,o,s,s-o,f,is it
