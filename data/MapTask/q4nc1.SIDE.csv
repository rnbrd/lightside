4,K1,s,s-K1,f,yes 
4,o,s,s-o,g,right 
5,A2,n,n-A2,g,if you just want to come like down past the extinct volcano down to like to towards the bottom of the page 
5,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
6,A2,n,n-A2,f,just straight down directly south 
6,A1,s,s-A1,g,uh-huh just straight down 
6,o,s,s-o,g,uh south 
7,K2,n,n-K2,f,how far 
7,K1,s,s-K1,g,south down to about equal to where the tribal settlement is further on 
7,o,s,s-o,f,equal to where the tribal settlement is 
8,K1,n,n-K1,g,just a wee bit below it because you're going to go start going ehm west you 
8,o,s,s-o,f,right 
7,ch,o,o-ch,f,i've no g-- i've not got any tribal settlement at all and other than that i've got an extinct volcano and that's heading down towards 
9,o,n,n-o,g,y-- you've not got a t-- 
9,o,s,s-o,g,you've not got 
7,o,o,o-o,f,the bottom of the page

9,K1,s,s-K1,f,no i haven't 
10,A2,n,n-A2,g,well you're going to go down about three centimetres down to where it the word says extinct volcano 
10,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
11,o,n,n-o,g,okay 
11,A2,s,s-A2,g,then you're going to start going along west 
11,A1,s,s-A1,f,west right okay for 
12,o,n,n-o,g,right 
12,A2,s,s-A2,g,keep on going until you're maybe about three centimetres from the the left-hand side of the page 
12,o,s,s-o,f,from the left-hand s-- 
13,K1,n,n-K1,f,that's quite a bit 
13,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh it's quite far along 
14,o,n,n-o,g,'kay 
14,A2,s,s-A2,g,so just about three in-- three centimetres from the left-hand side 
14,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
15,o,n,n-o,g,okay 
15,A2,s,s-A2,g,then you're going to start going up north

16,K2,s,s-K2,g,have you got a rope bridge 
16,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
17,A2,n,n-A2,g,so if you start just drawing drawing a line up towards the rope bridge 
18,K2,n,n-K2,f,up towards going diagonally across to the rope bridge 
18,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
17,A2,o,o-A2,g,just going up then veering off to the right up to the rope bridge 
17,A1,s,s-A1,f,'kay 
19,A2,n,n-A2,g,then you're going to go across the rope bridge 
19,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
20,K2,n,n-K2,f,so i draw a line through the rope bridge 
20,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
20,K1,s,s-K1,g,you're going to go through that 
20,o,s,s-o,f,okay 
20,o,s,s-o,g,right 
20,o,s,s-o,f,the end of the rope bridge 
21,o,n,n-o,g,you're at the end of the rope bridge 
21,A2,s,s-A2,g,now if you go down not very steeply but just ehm down south a bit 
16,K2,o,o-K2,f,down right 
21,A2,n,n-A2,g,about about another three centimetres just a gradual slope down 
16,K2,o,o-K2,f,gradual sort south through east 
16,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
16,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh slope to the east 
16,K1,s,s-K1,g,aye south to east slope down about three centimetres 
21,A1,n,n-A1,f,okay 
22,o,n,n-o,g,right 
22,A2,s,s-A2,g,so now you want to go east 
22,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
23,A2,n,n-A2,g,straight across 
23,o,s,s-o,f,just a straight line east 
23,o,s,s-o,g,just a straight line 
24,o,n,n-o,g,for about 
25,K2,n,n-K2,f,how far

25,o,o,o-o,g,right 
25,K1,s,s-K1,g,you're going to go along until you're underneath the collapsed shelter 
27,K1,n,n-K1,f,right i'll be underneath it by about two or three centimetres 
25,o,o,o-o,g,but 
28,K1,n,n-K1,g,uh-huh just a little below the o"" actually ""
28,o,s,s-o,f,right okay 
29,o,n,n-o,g,okay 
29,A2,s,s-A2,g,then you're going to start going up north again

30,A2,n,n-A2,g,and put your line through the o"" ""
30,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
31,A2,n,n-A2,g,and you're going to go up there for about about ehm let me see about ten centimetres up 
31,A1,s,s-A1,f,okay 
32,K1,n,n-K1,f,past the crevasse on the right on the left 
33,K2,n,n-K2,f,have you not got a crevasse

44,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
45,K2,n,n-K2,f,is this this so this is towards the edge of the edge of the paper 
46,A2,n,n-A2,g,for about three centimetres so you're kind of l-- 
45,K1,o,o-K1,g,uh-huh this is towards the edge of the paper 
45,o,s,s-o,f,okay 
46,A2,n,n-A2,g,so you're making another little kind of you're making a wee pit and now you're going to go back up again

55,K1,s,s-K1,g,this is directly up north 
55,K1,s,s-K1,g,a straight line up to the golden beach 
55,o,s,s-o,f,right 
55,o,s,s-o,f,from the top of the white mountain 
53,A2,o,o-A2,g,from the top of the white mountain right up 
56,K2,n,n-K2,f,how f-- how far up 
56,K1,s,s-K1,g,ehm about six centimetres 'til you're about ah 'til you're about ehm about the same distance away from you're about five centimetres six centimetres from the top of the page now 
56,o,s,s-o,f,right okay

58,K1,s,s-K1,g,right 'til it's just the bottom of slate mountain that'll be then 
57,A1,o,o-A1,f,okay 
57,o,s,s-o,g,okay 
59,o,n,n-o,g,and see how you what you did with the white mountain ehm
