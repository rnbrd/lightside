3,A2,n,n-A2,g,you have to go round that side though 
3,o,s,s-o,f,oh right right 
3,A1,s,s-A1,f,going left 
4,o,n,n-o,g,and 
4,A2,s,s-A2,g,then you go ahead mm you should see an old mill on your left again

7,A2,n,n-A2,g,ehm turn to your left 
7,ch,s,s-ch,f,i can't go left i havenae got to the old mill yet 
7,ch,s,s-ch,g,no 
8,K1,n,n-K1,g,you don't go to the old mill 
9,K1,n,n-K1,f,i can't go any further left i'm right beside the paper 
9,o,s,s-o,g,okay

10,o,s,s-o,g,right 
11,A2,n,n-A2,g,then you turn left at the bottom of the paper or turn
