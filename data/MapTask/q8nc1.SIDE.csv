1,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
2,K1,n,n-K1,g,i've got a route i've got a dotted line 
2,o,s,s-o,f,oh right 
3,K1,n,n-K1,g,but it's i don't see how it works if you haven't got for example got any pelicans 
3,o,s,s-o,f,right 
4,K2,n,n-K2,f,eh can you be sure that does it say can you be sure they are pelicans 
4,K1,s,s-K1,g,it says pelicans underneath them 
5,K1,n,n-K1,g,amongst other indications like the big saggy bit under the beak and stuff 
5,o,s,s-o,g,you know what i mean 
6,K1,n,n-K1,g,if you haven't got the same stuff and i'd go for a big 
6,o,s,s-o,f,yeah i think we're all right okay uh-huh 
6,o,s,s-o,g,right 
7,K1,n,n-K1,g,the start is above the summit of the extinct volcano in the bottom right-hand corner of the page 
8,K2,n,n-K2,g,have you got one of them 
8,K1,s,s-K1,f,uh i have got that 
9,K1,n,n-K1,f,it says start 
9,o,s,s-o,g,right 
9,o,s,s-o,g,it says start 
9,o,s,s-o,f,uh-huh hmm 
10,A2,n,n-A2,g,well you take the dotted line down to the left until it's below the volcano and you go along to the left under the tribal settlement 
10,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
11,K1,n,n-K1,f,i haven't got a tribal settlement 
11,o,s,s-o,g,aha 
11,o,s,s-o,f,right 
12,A1,n,n-A1,f,so i just i go sh-- sh-- straight down 
13,o,n,n-o,g,so i 'pose you just 
13,A2,s,s-A2,g,you go sort off the top of the volcano sort thing 
14,K1,n,n-K1,g,above the volcano and then down past it on the left 
13,A1,o,o-A1,f,right 
14,o,n,n-o,f,right 
15,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then sort down along the page straight along the bottom of the page 
16,K2,n,n-K2,f,straight along about the same level as the volcano 
16,K1,s,s-K1,g,a bit below it a bit below it 
17,K1,n,n-K1,g,and then there's a there's a on mine there's a tribal settlement 
17,o,s,s-o,g,right 
17,ch,s,s-ch,f,right i haven't got one of them 
18,K1,n,n-K1,g,in the bottom left-hand corner of the page 
19,A2,n,n-A2,g,so you go round that 
19,o,s,s-o,f,i know 
19,ch,s,s-ch,f,but i don't have one of them 
19,o,s,s-o,g,aye 
20,A2,n,n-A2,g,well imagine it's there 
20,A1,s,s-A1,f,mm-mm right 
21,K2,n,n-K2,f,have you got a rope bridge 
21,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh 
21,o,s,s-o,f,right 
22,A2,n,n-A2,g,after you've gone round the tribal settlement you go up and then you cross the rope bridge from left to right 
23,o,n,n-o,f,i've got a 
22,o,o,o-o,f,right 
24,o,n,n-o,g,okay 
24,A2,s,s-A2,g,once you get to the other side of the rope bridge you go down about an inch and then you go straight along again towards the right and up 
25,A2,n,n-A2,f,wait a minute down about an inch 
25,A1,s,s-A1,g,okay 
25,o,s,s-o,f,right 
26,A1,n,n-A1,f,round the machete 
26,o,s,s-o,g,well i suppose so aye 
27,K1,n,n-K1,g,i haven't got a machete 
27,o,s,s-o,f,oh you haven't got one 
28,K1,n,n-K1,g,but i suppose it would probably be a good idea to go round it 
28,o,s,s-o,f,right 
29,A2,n,n-A2,g,anyway you go down about an inch and along 
29,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm to the right right 
29,A2,s,s-A2,g,to the right until you come just to the left of the collapsed shelter and go straight up past it to the left of it 
30,K2,n,n-K2,g,if you've got a collapsed shelter 
30,K1,s,s-K1,f,uh-huh i've got one 
29,A1,o,o-A1,f,right so i'm going up that 
29,o,s,s-o,g,right 
29,o,s,s-o,f,uh-huh 
31,o,n,n-o,g,right so then 
31,A2,s,s-A2,g,you go up to about the middle of the page the whole page 
31,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
31,o,s,s-o,g,right 
32,A2,n,n-A2,f,above the crevasse 
33,K2,n,n-K2,f,have you got a crevasse 
33,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh that's must be why you go all the way up there 
33,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm 
34,A2,n,n-A2,g,and i suppose you go over the top of the crevasse and down between that and the saxon barn 
35,K2,n,n-K2,g,have you got a saxon barn 
35,K1,s,s-K1,f,uh-huh 
36,K2,n,n-K2,f,so i k-- i go over the top of the crevasse 
36,o,s,s-o,g,well 
36,ch,s,s-ch,g,well i haven't got one 
36,K1,s,s-K1,g,but i suppose you do 
37,K2,n,n-K2,f,mm i i jump 
37,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh 
37,K1,s,s-K1,f,right 
38,K2,n,n-K2,g,that's you know what i mean it goes up to the middle of the page to above th-- the level of the saxon barn and then it goes across towards the left over the crevasse presumably and down between that and the saxon barn and then along under the saxon barn do you see what i mean 
38,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
38,K1,s,s-K1,f,uh-huh 
39,A2,n,n-A2,g,and once you get to the other side of the saxon barn underneath it you go down about an inch to avoid the pelicans 
39,A1,s,s-A1,f,oh right 
40,K2,n,n-K2,f,which i haven't got right 
40,K1,s,s-K1,g,right 
41,o,n,n-o,g,uh-huh 
41,A2,s,s-A2,g,go down about an inch and along about an inch and then back up again to the left of the pelicans if you see what i mean 
41,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
41,o,s,s-o,g,right 
41,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm 
42,K2,n,n-K2,g,have you got a white mountain 
42,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
43,o,n,n-o,g,right 
43,A2,s,s-A2,g,well after the invisible pelicans you go up the page and eh in slightly s-- and then past to the past the white mountain to the left of it 
44,K2,n,n-K2,f,behind the white mountain or or to the s-- which side of the white mountain 
44,K1,s,s-K1,g,to the left of it 
45,o,n,n-o,g,you sort go 
46,A1,n,n-A1,f,go i'm going like round behind it 
47,K2,n,n-K2,g,why behind wh-- 
48,A1,n,n-A1,f,or in front of it 
49,K2,n,n-K2,g,what do you mean behind it or in front of it 
50,K1,n,n-K1,g,you don't go through it you just go past it 
50,o,s,s-o,f,right 
51,K1,n,n-K1,f,so this side of it then 
51,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
52,K1,n,n-K1,g,like to the left of it 
52,o,s,s-o,f,right 
53,A2,n,n-A2,g,you like go go past it sort do an outline of it to the left of it don't touch it 
53,o,s,s-o,f,oh right 
53,A1,s,s-A1,f,right round the top 
54,K2,n,n-K2,g,what do you mean round the top 
55,o,n,n-o,f,right 
55,K2,s,s-K2,f,see where it's written white mountain 
55,K1,s,s-K1,g,mmhmm 
56,K2,n,n-K2,f,do i go between that and the actual drawing of the mountain or do i go round the top of the mountain 
56,ch,s,s-ch,g,your mountain must be different from mine 
57,A2,n,n-A2,g,just go up the side of the page straight past the whole lot 
57,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
57,A1,s,s-A1,f,right okay 
57,o,s,s-o,g,right 
57,o,s,s-o,f,right 
58,K2,n,n-K2,g,so have you gone past the top of the mountain to the left of it 
58,K1,s,s-K1,f,uh-huh 
59,K2,n,n-K2,g,have you got a golden beach in the top left-hand corner of the page 
59,K1,s,s-K1,f,no 
60,K1,n,n-K1,g,well i have you don't actually go to it 
61,A2,n,n-A2,g,you just sort once you get past the top of the mountain go straight up but ehm leave like a couple of inches on the left and a couple of inches from the top of the page 
61,o,s,s-o,g,right 
61,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
62,A2,n,n-A2,g,and make that point a corner so that you turn to the right 
62,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
63,A2,n,n-A2,g,and eh go along another couple inches 
64,K2,n,n-K2,g,have you got a slate mountain 
64,K1,s,s-K1,f,uh-huh 
65,A2,n,n-A2,g,well go up the si-- up the left-hand side of it round the top and down the right-hand side of it and round the word slate mountain just sort do a circle round it 
65,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
66,A1,n,n-A1,f,so i'm going right round 
66,o,s,s-o,g,uh-huh 
67,K1,n,n-K1,g,until you come sort to sort underneath it underneath the words slate mountain 
67,o,s,s-o,f,mmhmm 
68,o,n,n-o,g,and then ehm 
68,A2,s,s-A2,g,sort drop down again down the middle of the page a couple of inches 
68,ch,s,s-ch,f,i can't do that 
69,K2,n,n-K2,g,why not 
69,K1,s,s-K1,f,'cause i've got some submerged rocks 
70,o,n,n-o,g,aye well 
71,K2,n,n-K2,f,have you got them 
70,K2,o,o-K2,g,is that underneath the slate mountain 
70,K1,s,s-K1,f,mmhmm 
72,A2,n,n-A2,g,well go between them and the slate mountain until you get to the other side of the submerged rocks i suppose they must be under it 
72,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
73,o,n,n-o,f,and i've got a secret valley 
73,K2,s,s-K2,f,have you got that 
73,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh

75,o,n,n-o,g,right well 
75,A2,s,s-A2,g,go down past to the left side of the submerged rocks 
75,A1,s,s-A1,f,mmhmm 
76,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then past the left-hand side of the secret valley 
76,A1,s,s-A1,f,right 
77,A2,n,n-A2,g,and then along the bottom of the secret valley 
78,K1,n,n-K1,g,and that's the finish 
78,o,s,s-o,f,oh right 
79,o,n,n-o,f,i've got 
79,K2,s,s-K2,f,you haven't got the other golden beach 
79,K1,s,s-K1,g,uh-huh uh-huh 
80,K1,n,n-K1,g,but we don't get that far 
80,K1,s,s-K1,f,we don't need it and that's it right 
81,K1,n,n-K1,g,that seems to be it yeah 
81,o,s,s-o,f,okay then
