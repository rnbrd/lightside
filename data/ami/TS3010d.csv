A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So comm now um comm last time . "
A,Task,"Can you uh push the button ? "
A,Task,"One time please . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I'm still the secretary . "
A,Task,"Now uh comm I ask you to presentate the prototype . "
A,Task,"One of your you two . "
C,Task,"I don't care . "
B,Other,"Oh this comm you mean ? "
C,Other,"Huh ? "
A,Task,"Yes . The prototype . "
B,Minor,"Yes comm well uh "
B,Task,"this is it . "
D,Other,"This is it . "
A,Other,"Well comm thank you . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm now "
B,Task,"It's uh it's uh it's yellow . "
B,Task,"And uh comm this is rubber . "
B,Task,"And and and this too . "
B,Minor,"The "
B,Task,"the sides . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"And the rest is hard plastic . "
B,Minor,"And uh "
B,Minor,"We uh we had some uh "
B,Task,"We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside . "
B,Task,"And then it covers the these buttons "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"until here or something . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So comm you can still operate uh all the things . "
B,Task,"Because you don't always use the menu . "
B,Task,"And then it can break . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And the buttons ? "
B,Minor,"Uh comm well uh "
C,Task,"Big . "
B,Task,"Big buttons . "
B,Task,"And everything is blue comm except the power button . "
B,Task,"And the mute . "
B,Minor,"Of uh "
B,Task,"yeah comm and the mute and the the other button . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Channel higher channel button . "
C,Minor,". "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And the joystick is for the volume and the channels . "
B,Task,"Uh comm yes . Yes comm "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"that's uh "
B,Task,"Very obvious . "
C,Task,"Up is channel up . "
C,Task,"Down is channel down . "
C,Task,"To the right is volume up . "
C,Task,"To the left is volume down . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so if joystick and L_C_D_ . "
A,Elicit,"What's the R_R_ "
A,Minor,"d "
C,Other,"The R_R_ ? "
B,Task,"R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo . "
A,Task,"Okay . Very good . "
A,Minor,"So comm we have "
D,Task,"That's on the rub rubber part . "
B,Task,"Uh comm yes . Yes . "
B,Task,"That's about here . "
A,Task,"So comm what they say on the side is put fashion there . "
A,Task,"Yes . It's good . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"So comm that's it . That's prototype . "
D,Other,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Now comm the finance . "
A,Task,"We don't know if it's th it if it's okay . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
A,Other,"So comm I'm gonna look . "
D,Minor,"Do we "
D,Elicit,"Do we change the "
A,Minor,"We have "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
D,Elicit,"Do we change the the order ? "
D,Elicit,"Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ? "
A,Minor,"Finance is um "
A,Minor,"Yeah it's "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"first uh "
A,Task,"Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Sorry . "
D,Minor,"That's uh um "
D,Task,"That can be none . "
D,Task,"Um comm we gonna do the evaluation now comm together . "
D,Other,"But I have uh a introduction how it works . "
D,Task,"So comm it will come up . "
D,Task,"Uh-oh . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Um comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well comm we uh uh comm "
D,Task,"I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias comm "
D,Task,"uh based on um our marketing strategy comm on uh the latest trends comm on user preferences . "
D,Task,"Uh comm we have a seven point scale from uh true comm as well . To false comm seven ? "
D,Task,"And on base of each c uh criteria comm we need to um give a rating . "
D,Minor,"We can uh "
D,Task,"Well comm it look like this . "
D,Task,"But we gonna uh do it here comm they said . "
D,Task,"So comm you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay comm yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um comm well uh we have the Word document "
A,Other,"Criteria . "
D,Minor,"You "
D,Task,"So we open up that blank here . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"Think I can "
D,Task,"Uh comm what this just an example . So comm this not very important . "
D,Other,"But um comm if I can get a number in here . "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"No comm it's okay . "
D,Task,"Well comm uh we can't do that . "
C,Other,"I'll get it . "
A,Task,"Oh comm it's okay . "
D,Task,"Um comm so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . "
D,Task,"Uh comm and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . "
D,Task,"And in the end comm we will c uh count an average of all rating . "
D,Task,"The first uh on each item . "
A,Elicit,"What do you think ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think it's uh Uh comm well technologically using comm it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features . "
D,Task,"Only the L_C_D_ . "
D,Minor,"So comm it "
D,Task,"Um comm I think I will give it a yeah comm yeah comm yeah comm a four . "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . "
C,Minor,"What uh not anoth uh comm "
C,Task,"not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have . "
C,Task,"I think technologically I'll give it an seven . "
C,Task,"Si six six . "
C,Task,"Sorry comm six . "
D,Task,"So now i I think you uh see it um its statement . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And you true or false . "
C,Other,"Oh comm true or false . "
C,Task,"Oh comm uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . "
D,Task,"And true is one . "
D,Task,"So comm yeah . Yeah . "
A,Other,"Two . "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
A,Elicit,"You ? "
B,Task,"Three . "
A,Task,"Me too . "
A,Task,"So it's a three . "
D,Task,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Um comm well "
D,Task,"It's a one . The first item . "
D,Task,"So comm okay the second item . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm this product is for all sorts of customers . "
B,Minor,"Mm "
D,Task,"Well comm it's a statement which uh I disagree with comm because we uh really aim uh at at young market "
D,Task,"and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow comm it's not uh really aimed for all customers . "
D,Task,"It doesn't look like that . "
A,Elicit,"So it's a "
D,Task,"That's uh a six . "
C,Task,"Five . "
B,Task,"Mm comm four . "
A,Task,"Yes comm it's for the younger g group . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but it's it's "
A,Task,"So it's uh half half of the people . "
A,Task,"So I think it's four . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . "
B,Task,"So I mean comm the colours are for young people comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"No . "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"So comm I think it's four . "
B,Minor,"older "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Maybe . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Give it a four . "
C,Elicit,"Four . "
D,Task,"Four . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Uh comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"We put the fashion in electronics . "
D,Task,"That's uh the motto of our company . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah comm well do we do this with uh this product ? "
D,Minor,"I um Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think if we do this comm as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . "
D,Task,"Um comm so I would give it a two . "
C,Task,"Me too a two comm because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . "
C,Task,"But the rest of it is . "
C,Task,"So comm I think a two . "
B,Task,"Yes . Two . "
D,Task,"Two . "
A,Task,"Uh comm I say uh a five . "
A,Task,"It's not fashion comm it's new . "
A,Task,"It must be a fashion . "
A,Task,"But it isn't . "
C,Minor,"It "
C,Task,"it will be fashion . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"It w If it's not a fashion "
A,Task,"we can put it in it . "
A,Task,"So comm it must be a fashion . "
A,Task,"I think it's a five . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Then make it th three . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yes comm I'll think of that too . "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"'Kay . Three is okay . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah comm agree ? "
A,Other,"I use my feet though . "
C,Other,"Oh comm we'll wait outside . "
D,Elicit,"A three . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah okay . "
D,Task,"The next element um is the product looks good . "
D,Task,"Well personally comm I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . "
D,Task,"So comm I would give this a five . "
C,Task,"I give it a one . "
B,Minor,". "
B,Task,"Yes comm a one . "
B,Task,"I like it . "
A,Task,"Well comm I say three . "
A,Task,"So comm counting then is two and a half . "
D,Task,"We have to do our uh "
C,Task,"Say two . "
D,Elicit,"Two or three ? "
A,Task,"Okay comm two . "
C,Task,"Two . "
D,Task,"Two . Okay . "
D,Task,"So comm well we gonna do the next part . "
D,Minor,"Uh comm yep . "
D,Task,"Uh uh comm the next statement . It has not too much buttons . "
D,Minor,"Um comm yeah comm "
D,Task,"I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . "
D,Task,"And in the end we calculate an average . "
D,Task,"So comm um that's why it's a negative in it . "
D,Task,"Um comm well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . "
D,Elicit,"So comm um uh did we uh do that ? "
D,Task,"Well comm uh if we go to uh this fashion comm I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . "
D,Task,"But you can you can go for that . "
D,Task,"And um that way comm you don't have a lot of buttons over . "
D,Task,"So comm I would give this a two . "
C,Task,"One . "
A,Elicit,"You ? "
B,Task,"One . "
A,Task,"Me too . One . "
D,Task,"One . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm but where where is the ? "
A,Task,"Next comm six . "
A,Elicit,"It does not get lost easily . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"Yeah comm did we implement uh the sound ? "
C,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Just a small thing . "
A,Task,"No comm we did not . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but uh "
A,Elicit,"So comm but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Ah . Yellow . "
A,Task,"I don't think so . "
C,Task,"Looks like a pistol . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Not a not a normal shapes . So "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch . "
A,Minor,"No . "
A,Task,"It won't get lost . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"It won't . "
A,Elicit,"A one ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm o one . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm a one . "
D,Task,"One . "
A,Task,"Next . "
D,Task,"Okay comm um well we aimed for the younger market . "
D,Elicit,"Uh yeah comm did we achieve that . "
D,Task,"I think with the way it looks and um it is designed comm I will give it a two . "
A,Task,"Yeah me "
C,Task,"Yeah . Me too . "
A,Task,"That was our target . "
A,Task,"Two . "
C,Task,"Two . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"There's a fancy look-and-feel . "
D,Task,"Uh comm yes . "
D,Task,"That that was uh comm yeah comm one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . "
D,Task,"I didn't uh say it in my presentation . "
D,Minor,"But um comm "
D,Elicit,"well does it have that ? "
D,Task,"I would say yes . "
D,Minor,"So um "
D,Task,"Well comm let's also give this a two . "
D,Minor,"T "
C,Task,"I gave this a one because of the rubber . "
C,Task,"It feels soft . "
C,Task,"Uh comm it looks like a l uh uh b uh comm a bit like a joystick . "
C,Minor,"It's Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm f very fancy trendy . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yes comm a one . "
A,Task,"I say a two . "
A,Task,"It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So I think s two is better . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . Two . "
C,Task,"Two is okay . "
D,Task,"And um comm then the last one I could think of comm "
C,Minor,". "
D,Elicit,"uh it goes with the latest trends . "
A,Task,"No comm it's new . "
A,Task,"Innovation . "
D,Task,"If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people comm and they ate uh fruit and vegetables comm "
D,Task,"well it has a um a nice colour comm uh well compared to food "
D,Minor,"but we didn't uh "
D,Task,"We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"So comm I would did not give this uh a one or two . "
D,Minor,"I "
D,Task,"We'll go for a three . "
C,Task,"I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Uh comm the latest trends are soft things comm "
C,Task,"you know comm like uh I said in my presentation . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"But the the colours are um basic comm like yellow comm red comm um blue . "
C,Task,"Something what also younger people want . "
C,Task,"It's also a trend comm so I'll give it a two . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Mm comm three . "
A,Task,"Me too . Three . "
D,Elicit,"A three . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"So um comm come back to the presentation now . "
D,Task,"So comm we find yourself there comm "
D,Task,"and now we have to calculate an average rating . "
D,Task,"So comm we will do that . "
A,Other,"Effort is three comm ten and twelve . Thirty comm forty comm fifty comm . "
D,Other,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Twenty one . "
A,Task,"So comm it's uh two and three nine two and one third . "
D,Task,"By nine . "
C,Task,"Two . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Um comm uh okay . "
D,Other,"Two . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Other,"Come on . "
A,Task,"Uh comm nah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So uh comm that's a pretty low rating comm I think . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"So comm it's good . "
D,Task,"So comm according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think . "
D,Task,"Oh . Nah . "
D,Other,"How am I doing ? "
D,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"And I closed your slide-show . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Back to my uh "
D,Elicit,"Which one was the last for you ? "
D,Other,"Uh comm dreaming . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Next please . "
D,Task,"Next . Finance . "
A,Task,"So comm now uh we have a product . "
A,Task,"Very happy . "
A,Task,"But uh comm is it cheap enough ? "
A,Minor,"Um comm so if uh "
A,Other,"I'll have a look . "
A,Task,"We have a battery . "
A,Task,"One battery . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Cheapest there is . "
A,Task,"Okay comm one battery . "
A,Task,"Electronics . Advanced chip . "
C,Task,"Expensive . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"it's the most advanced . "
A,Task,"Chip-on-print . "
A,Task,"We have that one . "
C,Task,"Well comm it's the most advanced . "
A,Task,"We have the simple comm regular and advanced . "
C,Task,"Advanced . "
A,Task,"We have the adva advanced . "
A,Task,"'Kay comm so uncurved or flat . "
A,Task,"Nope . "
A,Task,"Single curved or double curved ? "
A,Task,"We have double curved . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Then we have plastic comm wood comm rubber . "
A,Task,"we have half rubber comm half plastic . "
B,Task,"Mm comm yes . "
A,Task,"No titanium . "
A,Elicit,"Special colour . "
A,Task,"Yes comm yellow . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh comm yellow . "
B,Minor,"Mm comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Interface comm "
A,Task,"push-button . "
A,Task,"Scroll-wheel comm integrated scroll-wheel push push-button comm or L_C_D_ display . "
A,Task,"So comm we have the L_C_D_ "
A,Elicit,"We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? "
C,Task,"One . "
D,Task,"One . "
A,Task,"And it's not really a s "
C,Task,"Joystick uh thing . "
D,Minor,". "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's this one . "
A,Task,"Now comm uh button supplement . "
A,Task,"Special colour . "
A,Minor,"We already "
A,Task,"Uh comm that's the from the for the buttons . "
A,Task,"The buttons are regular colour . "
B,Task,"Mm comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"So comm then uh then then then then then then "
A,Minor,"Then "
C,Task,"We're not gonna make it . "
A,Task,"Uh comm no . "
A,Task,"It's too expensive . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Wh "
A,Task,"So comm we have to change something . "
C,Elicit,"What what are the costs ? "
A,Task,"Fifteen Euros . "
C,Other,"Fifteen . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel comm it's okay . "
A,Task,"'Cause we can't lose the battery . "
A,Task,"We can't lose the advanced chip . "
A,Task,"We can't lose the double curve . "
A,Task,"We have rubber comm special colour . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Minor,"We would have uh n "
C,Task,"A special colour . "
C,Task,"Uh comm I don't think it's a very special colour . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm no comm we "
A,Minor,"No comm it's uh "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
C,Elicit,"Yellow ? Uh comm is it a special colour ? "
D,Task,"For a remote control . "
D,Minor,"I've "
C,Other,"What ? "
D,Task,"For a remote control comm I think it is . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . "
A,Task,"Um comm then we uh lose two Euros . "
A,Task,"Then we have thirteen Euros . "
A,Task,"Half a Euro too much . "
A,Task,"Exactly the special colours . "
C,Task,"And what if we use only one sort of um "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Um just only plastic or only rubber ? "
A,Task,"That's one Euro . "
C,Other,"One Euro discount . "
A,Task,"So comm I don't think that's good . "
A,Minor,"Mm "
A,Task,"I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . "
A,Minor,"If "
C,Task,"If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up comm button down comm button right comm button left . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Then it's only thirteen Euros . "
C,Elicit,"And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ? "
A,Minor,"So uh yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Then you have "
A,Task,"Or you have to cut this off . "
C,Minor,"Uh uh-uh . "
A,Task,"Then it's not good anymore . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"So comm wait . "
A,Other,"Okay . I'll have a look . "
A,Minor,"We "
C,Task,"And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour "
C,Task,"it's a normal colour comm "
C,Minor,"wh "
C,Task,"No one will see it . "
A,Task,"Yellow rubber . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm normal . "
C,Task,"Normal colour comm and the the joystick away comm "
C,Task,"and put the button up comm button down comm right comm left . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"And it's twelve Euros comm I think . "
A,Other,"One minute comm please . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Other,"Is it maximum . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's normal colour . "
A,Elicit,"But if you lose the joystick comm it's still uh an advanced chip ? "
C,Task,"No . Uh comm no comm no comm no . "
A,Elicit,"Or it's then a regular ? "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Other,"Oh comm wait wait wait . "
D,Task,"The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ "
D,Elicit,"wasn't it ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Oh yeah . "
A,Task,"So comm the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick . "
C,Task,"Oh yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? "
C,Task,"If we lose the L_C_D_ comm then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm regular chip . "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Elicit,"Is it a good design ? "
C,Task,"Uh comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . "
C,Task,"And you don't have the L_C_D_ . "
D,Minor,"If uh "
C,Task,"So comm the T_V_s has to uh have to be up-to-date . "
D,Minor,"If we have the n no buttons "
D,Elicit,"If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons comm we would have uh comm we have thirteen Euros ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm comm yes . "
D,Task,"And then uh we move the the colour . "
D,Elicit,"What will that be ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Then it's okay . "
C,Task,"Huh . No knew that . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so no joystick . "
A,Task,"Oh no comm but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"then it's twelve Euro fifty comm then it's okay . "
A,Task,"Uh comm yes comm yes comm yes comm yes . "
A,Task,"No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . "
A,Task,"Twelve and a half Euros . "
A,Task,"Then it's okay . "
A,Task,"So comm we have to change that a little bit . "
A,Task,"And you cannot use the red and green button . "
A,Task,"Because if you give them a s uh colour comm "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"All the same uh "
A,Task,"you have to pay point two Euros . "
C,Task,"So comm all the buttons has to have to be the same colour . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"But then the print on it will g um change it . "
C,Task,"Make it uh "
C,Task,"for everybody to see what button it is . "
C,Elicit,"Uh l How you call it ? "
B,Minor,"Mm comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Recognisable . "
C,Task,"Recognisable comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Like what "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So Well "
A,Task,"Now we have to change that comm "
A,Task,"but that's okay . "
A,Task,"Rubber . "
A,Elicit,"What's the normal colour ? "
C,Task,"Oh comm well that's clear . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"And "
A,Elicit,"Where's ? "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So comm now it's "
C,Task,"And the joystick away . "
C,Task,"And its buttons . "
A,Task,"Yeah . It is . "
A,Task,"But then it will be just that ones . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Now it's "
D,Minor,"still comm he waited at the "
A,Task,"Very good . "
D,Minor,"No . "
A,Task,"Now comm uh project eva evaluation . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Elicit,"What do you think of it ? "
A,Minor,"Uh "
C,Other,"About the "
D,Task,"Project . "
A,Task,"About the project . "
C,Task,"process . Went good . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"I think uh the creativity uh was good enough . "
C,Task,"We have a gun instead of a remote control . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"Uh leadership . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm you were the project project manager comm and uh had the final vote . "
C,Task,"So yeah that was clear . "
