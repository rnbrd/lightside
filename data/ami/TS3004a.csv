A,Elicit,"you all read what we are going to do or not ? "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"We're gonna make a remote control . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
C,Task,"I think my laptop is a bit "
C,Task,"etchy . "
A,Task,"I just made a a simple uh presentation . "
A,Other,"So you put some things in it . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"How does this work ? "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"One uh most to the right . "
C,Minor,"Uh p "
B,Task,"Yes that one . "
A,Elicit,"This one ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Press F_ eleven . "
A,Other,"Ah "
A,Task,"cool . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
A,Task,"that's my name comm . "
A,Task,"Uh we're going to make uh a remote control comm "
A,Task,"you already know that . "
A,Task,"Just have a look comm "
A,Other,"are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting . "
A,Task,"You know comm this is about twenty five minutes comm this meeting . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Minor,"the thing we have to know is "
A,Task,"you already know what we're going to do comm "
A,Elicit,"you also read what this the things or comm not yet comm "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Other,"okay . "
A,Minor,"So um comm yeah comm "
A,Task,"it has to be original comm trendy comm user-friendly "
A,Task,"that's what we're going to design . "
A,Task,"Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . "
A,Task,"Fir the first thing is th the functional design comm "
A,Task,"that's very important . "
A,Task,"We have to look what the needs are comm the effects of the functional design comm and and how the mm the the remote control works comm so that's where we're going to look in the functional design comm "
A,Task,"it's for the f next meeting . "
A,Task,"The the second thing is the conceptual design comm "
A,Minor,"that's what it "
A,Task,"that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . "
A,Task,"And we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . "
A,Task,"And the third thing is uh the detailed design "
A,Minor,"um and that's exa "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"you know what it is comm "
A,Task,"it's exactly how it looks and whatever . "
A,Minor,"Okay so uh no comm "
A,Minor,"this is a "
A,Task,"these are two smartboards comm with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . "
A,Task,"And you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map . "
D,Task,"Folder comm "
D,Other,"yes . "
A,Other,"Folder comm okay . "
A,Minor,"So no okay "
A,Task,"have a look at that one . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So uh "
A,Minor,"what we're going to do first is um "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"you can read . "
A,Task,"You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard "
A,Task,"and um and say why it's your favourite animal . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"and you have "
A,Task,"this is just to try it out "
A,Task,"and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . "
A,Minor,"So okay comm so "
A,Other,"first have to show you comm "
A,Task,"maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . "
A,Elicit,"Yes ? "
D,Task,"Ah I can see it now . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"This a new page comm "
A,Task,"it's okay . "
A,Other,"Use pen format . "
A,Task,"and a different colour can use here "
A,Task,"no "
A,Other,"I just take the pink . "
A,Minor,"You take "
A,Minor,"oh "
A,Task,"there's no pink comm "
A,Minor,"okay comm oh "
B,Task,"Purple . "
A,Task,"just purple comm okay . "
A,Task,"No "
A,Other,"blue . "
A,Minor,"And uh "
A,Other,"line width ten . "
A,Minor,"Okay uh "
A,Minor,"just take "
A,Other,"what I'm going to draw is an elephant . "
A,Task,"Just draw slowly comm "
A,Task,"because otherwise it won't work . "
A,Task,"It's a very nice elephant comm you can see . "
A,Task,"I dunno what it looks "
A,Task,"but it doesn't matter . "
B,Task,"Looks very nice . "
A,Minor,"I just h "
A,Elicit,"Something like this ? "
A,Task,"Oh no "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"It look like a dinosaurs . "
A,Minor,"Because I like "
A,Minor,"uh okay . "
B,Task,"A pink elephant . "
A,Task,"Just takes so long comm "
A,Minor,"okay . "
A,Task,"Whatever comm "
A,Minor,"just . "
A,Other,"You erased this one . "
A,Task,"It's a bit slow you can see comm "
A,Task,"this is a bit annoying . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want . "
D,Other,"Let me try one . "
A,Minor,"Just don't "
A,Minor,"um yeah comm "
A,Task,"just u use it like that comm "
A,Task,"yeah . That's okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Mm . Okay "
D,Elicit,"and then uh what's the colour ? "
D,Elicit,"How do I do "
A,Task,"It's in format . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Ah . "
D,Other,"I'll take this one . "
D,Task,"Uh there has to be water comm "
A,Minor,"Just "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"it has to be an animal comm "
A,Minor,"so if that's it's "
D,Other,"Yeah yeah comm "
A,Task,"it should be a shna snake or something . "
D,Task,"but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water . "
A,Other,"Okay . Okay okay . Okay . "
B,Task,"The water is important . "
D,Task,"So I first uh draw the water . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Uh . Okay comm "
D,Other,"and now "
D,Other,"I make the animal . "
D,Task,"It's a fish . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"Wow . "
A,Other,"cool . "
D,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"So . Um "
D,Task,"This is a worm . "
A,Task,"Hmm yeah comm that's nice . "
C,Task,"Wow . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Elicit,"who next ? Uh "
A,Task,"Uh do you have to write down why "
A,Task,"uh that doesn't matter comm "
A,Task,"just it's to get used to the whiteboard comm "
A,Task,"but it's okay . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Just make a new blank new blank page . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Elicit,"Paul ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Like this ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"not too far to the to the t pen top . "
B,Task,"Okay . Um "
B,Other,"let's make it um a dog . "
B,Other,"Ooh . "
A,Task,"Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back comm "
A,Minor,"so that "
A,Task,"no comm "
A,Minor,"to the "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"I think it's a pig . "
B,Other,"Ah okay . "
B,Other,"A pig ? "
B,Minor,"I can make "
A,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"Or a dog . "
A,Task,"it's a dog . "
B,Minor,"a dog . "
D,Elicit,"A sheep ? "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Uh we d only have twenty five minutes comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
C,Task,"Take it easy . "
B,Minor,"'Kay comm "
B,Other,"I make a cat of it . "
C,Other,"I I was gonna make a cat too . "
A,Task,"Use your fantasy . "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"not too quick . "
A,Task,"Just hold it more more to the back "
A,Minor,"then you don't have "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"I have it . "
A,Other,"okay . "
B,Task,"I just draw too quick I think . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"that's it . "
B,Elicit,"More . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"that's okay comm "
A,Other,"thank you . "
B,Task,"It's just to get used to it . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I thought these pens would be just um uh you write it down and you download it to Word comm "
A,Elicit,"you already did it or no ? "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"No comm not yet comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's right comm "
B,Minor,"it "
B,Task,"but you actually got to write on the paper . "
A,Minor,"But it's just "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
B,Task,"You really got to write on that paper . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I know comm "
A,Task,"but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word comm "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah comm "
D,Task,"it's a real pen . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"so that's not "
B,Task,"but it's just a picture . "
A,Minor,"just "
A,Task,"it's just a picture . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"You really "
D,Elicit,"Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word . "
A,Task,"it's not that cool as I th thought it would be . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm okay . "
B,Task,"It's a donkey . "
A,Task,"I don't know comm "
A,Elicit,"what time did we start this meeting comm "
A,Task,"I'm not sure . "
B,Minor,"Uh I think it was uh "
A,Elicit,"Half past . "
D,Task,"Half past ten . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Brilliant . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"Nice comm "
A,Other,"perfect . "
C,Elicit,"eh ? "
D,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"thank you . "
A,Other,"Now we just have to save everything comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
A,Minor,"Oh "
A,Task,"this is definitely the best one . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so uh "
A,Task,"what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros . "
C,Other,"Excuse me . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"that's . "
A,Task,"And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros comm "
A,Task,"so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . "
B,Task,"Piece of cake . "
A,Task,"The production cost are about half the price of selling price comm "
A,Other,"sorry . "
B,Task,"Uh easy . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million comm "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Minor,"Uh so "
A,Task,"we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything comm "
A,Task,"so just have a look how it we think about remote controls . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ? "
A,Other,"Oh yeah comm "
A,Task,"that's a good question . "
D,Task,"Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television comm we sell it uh apart . "
A,Minor,"I think it's "
A,Task,"I'm not I'm not sure comm "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"I "
A,Minor,"it's not mm I think "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it probably would be universal . "
B,Other,"Universal . "
D,Minor,"Because "
B,Elicit,"And only television ? "
B,Elicit,"Or more devices ? "
A,Task,"I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros comm "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"not sure comm "
A,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"Hmm comm maybe comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think . "
B,Task,"Ah okay . "
A,Task,"Okay comm perfect . "
C,Elicit,"And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player "
C,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"Yeah comm everything "
A,Minor,"just "
C,Other,"okay . "
A,Task,"so a lot of buttons on the remote control . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm probably . "
B,Elicit,"Not just a T_V_ . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"just everything . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,". so yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"what what what's a remote control comm "
A,Task,"it's just a black thing with some buttons on it comm "
A,Task,"it's not nothing very special comm "
A,Minor,"but um "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"we can try to make it special . "
A,Task,"yeah comm that's right . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability "
B,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television comm "
A,Minor,"or user "
D,Task,"we don't have uh the same television uh all the time comm "
D,Task,"so uh that's no matter . "
D,Task,"Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear comm "
D,Task,"because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it comm "
D,Minor,"so uh "
D,Task,"it's not only for the uh technical persons . "
D,Task,"Um I think it must be a very good control comm "
D,Task,"so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room comm "
D,Task,"the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality . "
A,Minor,"Hmm yeah . "
A,Task,"That's right . Should be a good point . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Nothing "
C,Elicit,"And how big should it be ? "
B,Minor,"N "
D,Minor,"No . Yeah . "
D,Task,"I dunno um "
B,Task,"It shouldn't be too big comm "
B,Task,"but I don't think we can make it too small comm "
B,Task,"'cause it has to have a lot of functions comm "
B,Minor,"so . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think . "
A,Task,"Just big enough for the buttons we have comm that's that's it . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer comm "
D,Minor,"Yes "
B,Task,"maybe more trendy . "
A,Other,"But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open . "
B,Task,"Fold open comm "
B,Task,"where you can see uh more options . I think "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"yeah comm that's cool . "
D,Minor,"Ah "
D,Minor,"that's that's "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something comm "
C,Minor,"n "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"if you just "
B,Task,"something uh on top comm just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often . "
D,Other,"Ah right right . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"or you c "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Oh "
C,Task,"O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control . "
D,Task,"that's good comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"b I wanted "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? "
C,Minor,"Uh maybe be uh it's it's "
A,Task,"There are buttons on it . "
B,Minor,"No "
B,Task,"you can make an uh manual in it . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it . "
D,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"But that's "
C,Minor,"Uh like a a to have "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think it's much uh too expensive . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"Yeah comm maybe it would . "
D,Task,"but it's not reachable I think comm touch screen . "
D,Task,"And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Task,"And if you have a touch screen in it comm it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm too fragile . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it "
D,Task,"and touchscreen is not uh kids uh "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . "
C,Task,"Kid-proof . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um "
C,Elicit,"And uh how about the batteries ? "
C,Elicit,"Uh should you put it in a recharger "
C,Minor,"or a just "
A,Minor,"Oh "
A,Task,"maybe that's a good idea comm "
D,Task,"Ma maybe a home station . "
A,Task,"just to put it on your television and just s recharge comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"you never have to use any batteries . "
C,Task,"Mm yeah . "
B,Task,"Maybe that's a good idea comm "
B,Task,"but yeah comm we have to look at the price now I think . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Elicit,"uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ? "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive comm "
D,Task,"Ah yeah . "
C,Task,"but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing . "
B,Minor,"Maybe have uh "
A,Task,"Uh if you th look at the market comm it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it comm "
A,Task,"because maybe it's too expensive . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"'cause well "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but a home station is uh a really good idea comm "
D,Task,"because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is comm "
D,Task,"and now you can put it always at the same place . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's right comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Maybe it's "
D,Task,"Therefore it's a good idea comm "
D,Task,"but maybe it's expensive . "
B,Task,"Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"You can "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"you can buy it with it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh "
B,Task,"Rechargeable . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"or you can change your batteries comm "
D,Other,"Oh yeah . "
C,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"The option comm just the option comm that's cool . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh I I set something on paper already comm size comm looks comm uh usable comm "
D,Task,"uh the buttons on usable places comm "
D,Task,"uh the the on off button must be on top comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"uh it has to lay good in the hand comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"you you have to uh "
A,Minor,"Has it be has "
A,Elicit,"does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control "
D,Other,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I don't I don't know I don't know "
A,Minor,"or "
B,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"if we "
B,Task,"I think we have to look at that comm "
B,Task,"'cause well you can do the standard way comm "
B,Minor,"but then you won't "
D,Task,"You can make it very special comm to create our own um looks comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"but it's very hard to "
C,Minor,"N "
C,Task,"uh if if we want to make it special comm we probably have to do a lot of testing comm if it really works . "
D,Task,"Nah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"you can um have uh the basic things on the same place comm like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block comm and then the volume uh obviously on t on top comm so you can see . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But the rest is uh you don't use that often comm "
B,Task,"so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it comm it should be clear as well . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so you can do something unique with that . "
C,Minor,"And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open comm "
C,Task,"when you have it closed comm you can still uh do the th the functions . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah comm "
D,Task,"what Paul already said . "
D,Task,"Uh on on top are the the basic options on top comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm just for the T_V_ and just the normal function comm that's fine . "
C,Minor,"But n "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"but uh i "
D,Minor,"and if you fold it open "
C,Task,"basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so comm "
A,Minor,"But maybe it's "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's what I meant . "
C,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh "
A,Elicit,"what's it's called ? "
D,Task,"Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
A,Minor,"Maybe it's hard t "
A,Task,"No comm that's right . "
A,Task,"So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square comm just normal remote control . "
B,Task,"Okay comm but yeah . "
A,Task,"Just think about it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"There's some more things . "
A,Task,"We have uh another thirty minutes comm "
A,Task,"so then we're going to meet again . "
A,Elicit,"So you know what you have to what you have to do ? "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert comm the user requirements uh specification comm do I need to think as a user comm "
D,Minor,"a as a a a only the looks and the "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"what you want to do with it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ comm a D_V_D_ player comm all that things . "
D,Other,"Okay . Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Also from a user comm but all these things together . "
D,Task,"it's also about strength and uh for everything uh . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm everything . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I also wrote down some stuff "
B,Minor,"that you want on a "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"no maybe not not uh comm "
A,Minor,"that's not a f that's something for for for yeah . "
B,Minor,"Technical fun fu "
A,Task,"That's not for you . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
