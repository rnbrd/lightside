A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Good afternoon again . "
A,Task,"So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . "
A,Task,"Um So here is the agenda for today . "
A,Other,"Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting "
A,Task,"then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two comm "
A,Task,"sounds interesting . "
A,Task,"And we'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts . "
A,Task,"Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing "
A,Task,"and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So let's go . "
A,Other,"Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . "
A,Minor,"So we went through th uh "
A,Task,"w we took this following decisions . "
A,Task,"No L_C_D_ comm no speech recognition technology comm okay comm "
A,Task,"we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . "
A,Task,"We went through the use of wheels and but buttons . "
A,Task,"And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um . Good . "
A,Task,"So guys let this uh wonderful thing . "
C,Task,"Okay so we can go to the slides . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah . "
A,Other,"Sorry . Um . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Number three . "
C,Task,"Oh number two "
C,Other,"sorry . "
A,Elicit,"Which is "
C,Task,"So final design . Final design . "
C,Minor,"Okay so "
C,Task,"Michael you can go ahead . "
B,Task,"Yeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow well to make a banana "
A,Task,"Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe . "
B,Task,"remote "
B,Minor,"okay so "
B,Minor,"we actually have a "
C,Task,"You can pull it out first comm maybe . "
B,Minor,"We've "
B,Task,"well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"bana sit "
B,Task,"the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over "
B,Task,"and um this is the remote itself comm "
B,Task,"it's kind of it's it's ergonomic comm it fits in the hand uh rather well . "
B,Task,"We've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here "
B,Task,"which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel "
B,Task,"and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button "
B,Task,"which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally . "
A,Elicit,"What's the use uh of the t turbo button already ? "
B,Task,"This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th "
A,Task,"Ah yeah yeah "
A,Task,"an then you stop when you stop it stops . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . "
B,Task,"But normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"And we we do have one more functionality . "
C,Task,"If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button comm so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ . "
B,Task,"The T_V_ yeah . "
A,Other,"Which one ? "
B,Task,"The s the turbo button . "
C,Task,"The turbo button . "
B,Task,"So rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Additional button . "
D,Elicit,"What this button for ? "
B,Task,"This is a teletext button . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So once you press that then you get teletext "
B,Task,"and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh "
A,Task,"To navigate it through th through teletext . "
D,Elicit,"But if you want to go to page seven hundred ? "
B,Task,"To navigate yeah . "
C,Task,"That's right comm that's right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"with the wheel it's easy . "
D,Minor,"How man "
B,Task,"Well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing comm "
B,Task,"you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields "
B,Task,"and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh "
D,Other,"I don't understand it . "
D,Elicit,"Can you repeat it ? "
B,Task,"Well you can you can press press the teletext button "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"and then you then you can you can f "
C,Task,"So then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing . "
C,Minor,"And you can tele "
D,Other,"Ah okay okay . Okay . Okay okay . "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext comm they are no more for channel or vol volume . "
B,Minor,"Mm uh "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"I see . I see . Okay . Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And this is the uh the infrared uh port . "
C,Task,"That's right . "
B,Task,"Also the top of the banana . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Excellent . "
B,Minor,"So . And then we have "
B,Task,"in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana . "
A,Task,"Calling . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Excellent . "
A,Elicit,"And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ? "
B,Task,"Actually they do . "
B,Minor,"That's that's "
A,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So it always means comm whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage . "
C,Task,"It's like antennas . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So . "
B,Minor,"But yeah that's um that's just like "
B,Task,"that's an attractive um base station . "
A,Task,"Great . "
B,Minor,"So . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So comm what else ? "
C,Task,"And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries "
C,Task,"and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries . "
D,Elicit,"Is it really weight ? "
D,Elicit,"Is it light or "
C,Task,"It is very light . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm they're light . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"You know comm to give you the correct look and feel . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Ok "
C,Task,"And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Otherwise it's you know a child comes and so "
D,Other,"Yeah yeah yeah comm I see . I under I understand . "
B,Task,"I think a child would try to eat it anyway comm "
B,Task,"so maybe we should "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"consider that . "
B,Task,"maybe health and safety aspects . "
A,Minor,"Ah yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Oh we didn't think of that yet . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So for the power source comm apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries . "
C,Task,"Oh yeah that's right . "
A,Minor,"Uh you mean "
A,Minor,"okay . So "
B,Task,"I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"where are going to "
A,Elicit,"where are you are you going to place them ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"It'll It'll be always at top somewhere at there . "
B,Task,"If I was gonna place them I'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit "
A,Elicit,"You have enough surface ? "
A,Minor,"You "
B,Task,"but yeah I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore . "
C,Task,"Yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"so that that is . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"What will be the autonomy ? Roughly ? "
B,Other,"The what sorry ? "
A,Task,"The autonomy . "
A,Task,"Autonomy . "
B,Elicit,"What do you mean ? "
A,Task,"Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ? "
D,Minor,"How long the "
D,Task,"how long the bit the batteries long . "
B,Other,"Ah . "
B,Other,"Ah . "
B,Task,"A long time . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Eight to ten eight to ten hours . "
A,Minor,"A long "
B,Task,"No no no comm "
B,Minor,"it can "
B,Task,"it should be weeks . "
C,Minor,"N most "
C,Task,"no most of the time it's not being used . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"so it's "
B,Task,"Yeah but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so "
C,Task,"So when when you are making it on "
A,Minor,"It's used only when you "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"No eight or eight or ten hours of working . "
C,Task,"If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer . "
B,Minor,"Ah comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"F weeks . "
C,Task,"Yeah . That's right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Other,"Next slide ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And we are having the speakers regular chip for control . "
C,Task,"Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . "
C,Task,"And uh that's it . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Those really sounds very good . "
C,Task,"That's right . "
A,Elicit,"Nothing else to add ? "
B,Task,"It seems to be falling over . "
D,Minor,"I l yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I like I like it . "
D,Task,"Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons . "
D,Minor,"Looks a bit "
C,Elicit,"You want to have more functional buttons ? "
D,Task,"Looks a bit puzzled "
D,Task,"uh I dunno how to say that . "
D,Task,"You the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not "
C,Elicit,"You are not convinced . "
C,Task,"Not not many comm we we want to keep it simple . "
C,Task,"So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case comm "
C,Task,"that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that comm the channel buttons comm they baco become the scrolling buttons . "
D,Elicit,"And the volume button will will become "
C,Task,"It's up to you comm means . "
C,Minor,"Now that "
A,Task,"Well in fact b both will be could be useful comm navigating through teletext . "
C,Task,"Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits . "
B,Task,"Or can move between positions in the in the number . "
C,Task,"That's right . "
D,Elicit,"And what about people who want to use digits ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Butto real buttons ? "
A,Other,"Wow . "
C,Task,"Yeah . So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape . "
C,Task,"So we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing comm they they don't care about the buttons any more . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"And anyway "
D,Elicit,"Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff ? "
B,Task,"It's all automatic . "
D,Other,"It's all automatic . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay yeah it's fine . "
A,Task,"Very good uh yeah "
D,Other,"W we are living in a wonderful world . "
A,Minor,"you th "
A,Other,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Other,"Bananas everywhere . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
D,Other,"Automatically configure . "
A,Task,"So we have to go through now evaluations . "
C,Minor,"Evalua yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So your slides are ready ? "
D,Minor,"S "
A,Task,"Uh you're four I think . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So this is one comm which one is this one ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"I I const "
D,Task,"I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . "
D,Task,"And each criteria is will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria "
D,Task,"so we must users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven . "
C,Elicit,"Why this strange factor of seven ? "
D,Minor,"Because i "
D,Other,"I'm sorry . Sorry . "
C,Task,"Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten . "
D,Task,"Ah yeah . "
D,Minor,"It's from "
D,Other,"sorry comm "
D,Task,"it's from one to seven . It's from from one to seven "
D,Other,"sorry . "
D,Task,"Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Num number "
C,Minor,"Okay . Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and five "
D,Task,"is too short and nine is too long . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay fine comm got the idea . "
D,Minor,"I'm a I I'm "
A,Task,"So to have in order to have enough granularity "
D,Other,"Sorry ? "
A,Task,"it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"The variance is mi it's is minimal . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"okay comm great . "
D,Elicit,"I'm um answering your question . "
C,Task,"Okay . Yeah yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Go ahead . "
D,Task,"And that's the criteria I I found more useful . "
D,Task,"I think I sh I I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ? "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . Sure . "
D,Task,"And we all four could range "
C,Task,"Okay . Yeah yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"could evaluate the "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So you can say fancy comm "
C,Task,"handy . "
C,Task,"Handy . "
D,Elicit,"Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's fancy comm according to me . "
D,Elicit,"Seven but "
A,Task,"Yeah comm six . "
C,Task,"Seven . Seven by me . "
A,Task,"S seven . "
A,Task,"Six . "
D,Task,"I would say seven . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"It's quite fancy . "
C,Task,"So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus "
A,Other,"No comm wait . "
B,Task,"Yeah uh five . "
A,Elicit,"What do you say seven ? "
C,Task,"Five . "
A,Other,"Five ? "
B,Task,"Five comm "
B,Task,"maybe maybe maybe six "
B,Minor,"it's it's I guess it's "
A,Task,"Okay comm six point five . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Handy ? "
C,Task,"Again I'll give seven . "
A,Task,"Seven . "
B,Task,"I'd give it a six "
B,Task,"like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote comm 'cause of the scroll wheels "
D,Task,"Six . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason "
B,Task,"but you know you can always use your other "
B,Task,"remote . "
A,Elicit,"So seven comm seven comm "
C,Task,"Seven for me . "
A,Elicit,"six comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Six . "
A,Task,"six point five . "
A,Elicit,"Functional . "
C,Task,"I'll give five . "
A,Task,"Four . "
D,Minor,"I would say "
B,Elicit,"Well it depends when you say functional comm do you mean it does what we want it to do comm or d does what it does comm you know comm can it make you coffee ? "
D,Minor,"Everything ar "
B,Other,"You know . "
D,Minor,"Mm everything "
A,Task,"Uh for a remote control comm does he have all the "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"you could expect . "
D,Task,"It's compared to the all "
C,Task,"That's right . "
D,Task,"remote controls . "
C,Task,"That's right . "
B,Minor,"That's before "
C,Task,"The standards . What is available in the market off the shelf . "
B,Task,"Yeah . I have to say four . "
D,Task,"Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro "
B,Task,"Well it's not a universal remote . "
B,Task,"Remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on T_V_s . "
C,Minor,"We "
D,Elicit,"Ah it's not an univer but it's for all kind of T_V_s ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well all T_V_s but only T_ only T_V_s I guess . "
A,Task,"So it's universal but for T_V_s . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So s uh four ? "
C,Task,"Five . "
A,Other,"Five ? "
B,Task,"Four . "
A,Other,"Four . "
D,Task,"Four . "
D,Task,"Four . "
C,Elicit,"So four point two ? "
B,Task,"Just four . "
A,Task,"Four . "
C,Task,"four . "
D,Elicit,"So four ? "
B,Task,"Obviously there are some outliers so "
A,Elicit,"Okay cool ? Cool device . "
C,Task,"There I'll give it seven . "
D,Task,"It means cool features comm like new features actually . "
C,Task,"That's right . "
B,Minor,"Which "
C,Task,"For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature . "
C,Task,"And then the scroll buttons are again cool features . "
C,Task,"We don't have L_C_D_ for it but that we decided we don't want to have . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Seven . "
D,Task,"I would say five . "
B,Task,"I'll say five . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Six . "
C,Task,"Seven . "
A,Task,"Plus six comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I say I said seven . "
A,Task,"So it's six . "
B,Task,"S yeah . "
D,Other,"You said seven ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"'Cause it's five five seven seven so "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh comm okay comm definitely easy to use . "
C,Task,"Definitely seven . "
B,Task,"Seven . "
A,Task,"Seven . "
A,Task,"Seven . "
A,Elicit,"And you ? "
D,Task,"Five . "
A,Task,"Outl you are not lik outlier . "
A,Elicit,"Seven "
D,Other,"Sorry comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I have them "
A,Task,"Okay okay okay okay . "
B,Task,"Alright comm now here's the sixty million Dollar question comm "
B,Task,"well comm twenty five twenty five Euro question . "
A,Task,"Of course I'll buy the banana . "
B,Elicit,"What do you what do you guys reckon ? "
C,Task,"I'll say five . "
D,Task,"Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end . "
A,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I'll say five . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Other,"Twenty five Euros . "
D,Task,"I find it quite cheap actually . "
D,Task,"I dunno . If i i it depends comm if you live in in Switzerland or you live in "
A,Task,"Cheap . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"so the target price is for all Europe comm or only for rich countries ? "
A,Elicit,"It's more targeting U_K_ or "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Elicit,"Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or "
A,Elicit,"So this is selling costs comm not production costs . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah this is the the initial specifications . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah sure . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Five . "
D,Task,"I would say six . "
D,Task,"It's quite cheap actually . "
B,Task,"I'd say two . "
C,Elicit,"Why ? "
B,Task,"I don't want a banana on my living room table comm a banana remote . "
A,Task,"Aw comm should be nice in your "
C,Task,"No but it's really handy actually if you see . "
B,Task,"It is handy comm it's handy comm but it it's terrible . "
C,Task,"It's it's so handy . "
C,Minor,"And then "
C,Task,"Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this . "
A,Task,"It's kitsch . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but it's not a positive thing . "
C,Task,"It's a very positive thing if you see like that . "
B,Task,"Well comm you know comm it's it's handy comm it's ergonomic comm but it's a banana . "
A,Minor,"Well comm don't forget well comm don't for "
A,Task,"don't forget who we're targeting also "
A,Minor,"who are f f who are wh "
C,Task,"Youngsters . "
D,Minor,"Actually maybe "
A,Task,"yeah comm youngst youngst "
B,Task,"Yeah but it says I comm I would buy this comm so . "
A,Task,"No well yeah "
A,Minor,"I "
A,Task,"if you would be young . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Other,"Not telling that you are young . "
A,Task,"Li li like a teenager for instance . "
B,Task,"No comm it's I . I would buy "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Other,"you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things . "
C,Other,"You want to flaunt . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"You with your girlfriend or something . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm you want to show the beautiful banana you have . "
B,Minor,"S s "
C,Task,"Or might be it does some other kind of thing but "
B,Task,"Still I I'd say two . "
B,Task,"I don't think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control comm really . "
C,Task,"Uh yeah comm crazy . "
A,Minor,"Okay so you s you give "
B,Task,"I can say comm maybe there is a market for it comm I dunno . "
A,Task,"oh yeah yeah I know I know . "
A,Task,"So you say two . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I say five . "
A,Task,"F I d I say five . "
A,Elicit,"You say ? "
D,Task,"I change the question . "
A,Elicit,"So what's the new question ? "
C,Elicit,"And you have saved it ? "
D,Task,"So yeah upload the "
C,Task,"You'll have to reload . "
A,Task,"Uh yeah comm I think so . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so comm it depends if uh "
D,Task,"Yeah it's two different situations "
D,Task,". If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one . "
A,Task,"Yeah that's two different question . "
B,Task,"If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro comm if that was like my limit comm maybe I would buy it . "
B,Task,"Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look "
C,Minor,"They're not going to be as "
A,Task,"Ugly . "
B,Task,"worse than a banana . "
C,Task,"And they they might not be a as easy as this "
B,Minor,"And it "
B,Task,"yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So ? What now ? What range ? "
C,Minor,"S "
A,Task,"I stick to five . "
C,Task,"I go slightly up . "
B,Task,"Although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning "
C,Task,"Six . "
D,Task,"Six . "
B,Task,"so I dunno . Um . "
A,Task,"W we have six comm five "
B,Minor,"I'd give it I'd give it a "
A,Task,"Three "
B,Task,"I give it a four now . "
A,Elicit,"So we are "
D,Task,"Six ? Six ? "
C,Task,"Six comm five comm four . "
A,Task,"six comm five comm four "
D,Task,"Six comm so it's uh five point five comm or less . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So and last question comm "
A,Elicit,"will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana . "
A,Task,"Um comm zero . "
A,Task,"No uh we can't . "
A,Task,"So one . "
D,Task,"Actually yeah comm "
D,Minor,"I we "
A,Minor,"Well if . "
A,Task,"No uh let's say I'll put two . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I'd say three comm "
B,Task,"I mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible . "
B,Task,"If it was change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to "
A,Task,"It's for the T_V_ . "
B,Task,"but uh 'cause it's really bad but uh "
B,Task,"I'd say a three . "
C,Task,"I'll still give it five . "
D,Other,"Five ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Two three five two three fi and two . "
D,Task,"You are romantic comm really . "
D,Task,"I would say two . "
C,Task,"So it's somewhere three point five I think . "
A,Minor,"So it's r "
A,Task,"Yeah comm three point five . "
D,Elicit,"Who is the outlier ? "
D,Elicit,"Wh wh you said five ? "
C,Task,"No I said five . "
A,Task,"No no you say five comm he is the outlier . "
A,Task,"Okay just just do a sum . "
D,Minor,"I don't know if it's a "
B,Task,"It's not very promising but you know we're not young trendsetters . "
D,Minor,"No because there are more "
D,Task,"yeah comm we shouldn't sum like that . "
A,Task,"Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob "
D,Task,"Because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell . "
B,Elicit,"Is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up ? "
D,Task,"Uh no I didn't anything . "
B,Task,"Well just leave it at that then . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Oops . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"the uh "
A,Task,"So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . We can had uh have a out of these numbers comm which which is that well we should go for it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Do you want me to sum "
A,Elicit,"Problem with connectors ? "
D,Minor,"o I think it's not "
B,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"I think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it comm so . "
C,Task,"Yeah it's it's funny . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,". So let's move uh let's move on . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
A,Task,"Okay comm now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay "
A,Task,". So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet . "
A,Task,"Um well we are going to calculate the production costs . "
A,Task,"We should we should be below twelve point five . "
A,Task,"So I already uh put some pu some numbers here comm okay . "
A,Task,"We are going to go through "
A,Task,"so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing . "
A,Task,"So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about . "
A,Task,"Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Well we decided against the solar cells so "
A,Task,"Oh yeah finally we say no . "
C,Task,"Solar cells comm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah comm we said no to that . "
A,Task,"Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines . "
A,Task,"So hand dynamo . "
A,Task,"This something we didn't thought about . "
A,Minor,"But "
B,Elicit,"You mean comm charging it by shaking the banana . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"To bring the cost "
A,Task,"Okay so we we stick to battery comm one . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No kinetic also . "
A,Task,"I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo . "
B,Task,"Well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually "
A,Task,"Ah you have to ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana . "
D,Minor,"S "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Crazy . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So those banana is falling . "
A,Task,"Let's go ahead . "
A,Task,"So we we st only have one for battery . "
A,Task,"Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the . "
C,Task,"So we have the regular chip on the print comm which is one . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And that's it . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"No so we hin "
C,Task,"And we have sample speaker . "
A,Task,"Yeah so one . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"the cost of that is very high . "
A,Other,"Ooh ye ye ye "
A,Task,"the cost is increasing . "
B,Task,"Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that comm "
A,Minor,"So we are "
B,Task,"we're just using the the very beep simple beep comm "
A,Task,"The beep . "
B,Task,"that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Minor,"That's what "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay "
A,Other,"so I'll remove it . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"I say that "
A,Minor,"S "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And we have sev "
A,Minor,"So don't we need a "
A,Task,"Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"So we we'll put some extras comm if there is something . "
A,Task,"Yeah maybe . "
A,Task,"We'll see later . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Okay so in for the case um "
A,Task,"I put single curved . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"To reduce the cost comm it's okay . "
B,Other,"Well comm wait a second comm "
A,Task,"Because we have two things . "
B,Task,"no comm it's it's double curved comm "
B,Minor,"it's got a c comm it's uh "
C,Task,"Oh it's got all the directions "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"so don't worry . "
B,Task,"Well d yeah it's monotonic but "
C,Task,"It's got a direction . "
B,Task,"it's got but if you hold it if you hold it that way that's two curved comm "
B,Task,"one on this side comm one on that side comm but they're opposite sides . "
A,Minor,"Well . "
D,Minor,"Actually what's the differen "
A,Minor,"What a "
A,Other,"what i if I put one here . "
B,Minor,"This is actually I mean this probably "
B,Task,"this probably actually costs more than three "
A,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"if you "
A,Task,"so let's put one here in the then instead of single "
C,Minor,"Okay . Okay . "
A,Elicit,"oka all right . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So we stick to plastic comm it cost nothing . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"That's right . "
B,Elicit,"Well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"it's too "
A,Task,"no . "
B,Elicit,"if you drop it ? "
D,Task,"Too expensive . "
A,Task,"It's too expensive . "
B,Minor,"Well when "
A,Task,"We're already at eleven . "
B,Task,"okay . "
B,Task,"Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in . "
A,Task,"Okay "
A,Other,"so I put rubber one . "
A,Task,"Okay so special colour comm yellow . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh for the interface we have "
C,Task,"We don't have any push buttons . "
B,Task,"No comm we have two push buttons . "
A,Task,"We have three . "
C,Task,"No that is a scroll wheel itself comm it'll be put in that . "
B,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Task,"No no . "
A,Task,"We have two scroll comm and we have three push buttons . "
C,Task,"Ah okay comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm okay . "
D,Task,"Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two comm because there is another chip here . "
B,Task,"Okay it's gonna have to be plastic . "
A,Minor,"And "
A,Task,"No it's no chip . "
A,Task,"This is just radio frequency . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Th This is no chip . "
D,Minor,"Yeah but "
C,Task,"No . There's no chip there . "
D,Minor,"you need "
C,Task,"It just emits the signal . "
A,Minor,"It's just "
C,Task,"And the receiver accepts it and that's it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Fo i it does nothing actually ? "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Just se sends the signal comm that's it . "
A,Minor,"Just only . "
B,Task,"It's a recharger thing "
B,Minor,"and uh "
A,Task,"Okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons . "
B,Task,"Well I actually did um think about it myself "
B,Task,"but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but you know the turbo button does add that extra class . "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"You know . "
B,Task,"So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So no L_C_D_ comm "
A,Task,"so for we have no button supplements comm "
C,Task,"Yep . "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Elicit,"well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement "
A,Minor,"because "
A,Task,"oh no comm "
A,Task,"these are these are for colours comm co and special forms comm special colours and special materials . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"No we're not "
B,Task,"we don't need anything special for the buttons . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Okay so we are over budget . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So first thing which we should take care of is comm "
B,Task,"Make it plastic instead of rubber . "
C,Task,"instead of rubber comm let it be plastic . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents . "
C,Task,"And uh that much money will be required for the base station comm which is not there . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So mayb in fact n we have to put two here "
A,Task,"because it cost nothing . "
B,Task,"Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's right . "
C,Task,"So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go "
A,Task,"Exactly exactly "
A,Task,"so we have margin for that stuff . "
C,Task,"That's right . "
B,Elicit,"Does that include charging circuitry and everything ? "
A,Task,"Yeah maybe . "
A,Task,"Okay good . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Wha "
A,Task,"Excellent . "
B,Elicit,"So what do we do with the extra profits ? "
A,Task,"Um we'll invest in R_ and D_ . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"The next fruit . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So well we're under the the the cost . "
A,Task,"So we can go to through to project evaluation . "
D,Task,"Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy . "
D,Other,"Would yeah comm would buy . "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
B,Task,"No we have a product which none of us would buy . "
D,Minor,"Yeah because th th the evaluation project "
A,Task,"Which is different . Which is different . "
A,Task,"None of us will buy it . "
B,Task,"No it's people in in in Milan and uh in Paris that are gonna buy it . "
D,Task,"Ah would buy comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Massively comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"We're n "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"We're not in Milan or Paris . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
D,Task,"Uh you have been in Milan a couple of times comm so . "
B,Minor,"Actually there were a lot of "
A,Task,"This is a battery . "
D,Task,"And you said the lowest . "
A,Task,"This is what we which you can mm "
C,Minor,"S "
C,Task,"Detachable battery . "
B,Task,"That's 'cause I'm sick of Milan . "
A,Task,"It did yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm for the batteries "
A,Task,"Extra battery comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Exac "
B,Elicit,"Okay so um project process . "
A,Task,"Well in fact I I did not know I didn't know really what to say here . "
A,Elicit,"If uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I don't I don't I don't understand what what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example . "
A,Elicit,"Should it be more like um like a status of of the these meetings in fact . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen comm not that much . "
B,Task,"I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah it's really creative . "
B,Task,"And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting . "
B,Task,"We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"They like that . "
B,Task,"see if they like it . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah maybe we should go through comm yeah an uh evaluation . "
B,Task,"Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of "
C,Task,"Biased . "
B,Task,"pointless . "
A,Task,"So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation in the streets like asking to young peoples well comm do you like to have a banana as a remote control . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well comm to see you know how to how to market this thing . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"'Cause you know if "
B,Task,"well I mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time "
B,Task,"but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a T_V_ for each kid comm then you know comm banana remote control could be fun for them as well . "
B,Task,"Might have to draw a face on it . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Elicit,"Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time ? "
A,Task,"Dunno comm oranges ? "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"The cost of the thing can be made more than might be . "
C,Task,"Because I think it's just the optimal comm what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the "
C,Elicit,"Interface . "
B,Task,"Well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I'm not sure really how complicated our um "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"our needs are . "
B,Task,"I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers comm "
B,Elicit,"do we really need an integrated circuit to "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Elicit,"you know to process that . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on T_V_ . "
C,Task,"That's right . "
D,Task,"The complexity shouldn't be much higher . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"For "
D,Minor,"you said if it good for D_V_D_ then I would "
B,Task,"And also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff comm "
B,Task,"that would be rather cool . "
B,Task,"I think that's actually something that should be in version two comm is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_ "
C,Task,"Integrate . "
B,Task,"and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Very good . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"What else ? "
A,Task,"Well done . "
A,Task,"I think we we can go "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Home ? "
A,Task,"home . "
C,Task,"Happily satisfied . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Maybe maybe we can hassle the the "
A,Other,"production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Other,"Okay so thanks very much . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Bye . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Other,"Bye . "
