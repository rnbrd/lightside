A,Task,"Okay comm almost there . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"We'll sta I'll use the PowerPoint comm I guess . "
C,Elicit,"How was that comm was that fun ? "
D,Task,"Mm . Very fun . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes comm "
C,Other,"but I will do . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Upsidaisy . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Um Um we "
B,Other,"E excuse me "
B,Task,"I forgot my "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Alright comm okay comm yeah . "
B,Task,"copy . "
C,Task,"He's gonna get his pen . "
D,Task,"Oh right . Okay . "
C,Task,"Um Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ? "
A,Other,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"there's good news ? "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Oh . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"we have budget problems . "
A,Task,"Oh . "
A,Other,"Cutbacks . "
C,Other,"I'm afraid you're all sacked . "
C,Other,"Oops . "
C,Task,"I don't even have this on . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Elicit,"Okay comm have you got a presentation to make ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"No comm not mine yet . "
C,Task,"No . Okay "
C,Task,"so it's just your your show . "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Other,"Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . Sure . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"We made three for you . "
C,Task,"Three ? Oh . "
D,Task,"Um one's based on the banana comm one's based on the tomato "
D,Minor,"and the other one is st "
C,Elicit,"Tomato ? What tomato ? "
C,Task,"I don't recall a tomato . "
D,Task,"Look . "
D,Task,"Oh yeah comm well yeah comm we had v some red left over . "
D,Minor,"So . Okay comm "
C,Task,"Ah I see comm okay . "
D,Task,"so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one comm "
D,Task,"or as mm few buttons as possible comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"mainly speak recognition . "
D,Task,"The yellow there is the um "
C,Task,"Logo . "
D,Task,"the slogan comm yeah comm "
D,Task,"that we need to incorporate comm "
C,Task,"Okay comm brilliant . "
D,Task,"it's very simple . "
D,Task,"If you do need buttons comm you can flip it over comm and there's some there comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"um but mainly it's speech recognition . "
C,Elicit,"Okay comm so the buttons would be like comm you know individual users comm or "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah and "
D,Task,"yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . "
C,Task,"Alright comm okay . "
D,Task,"Mm I'm not sure about that . "
D,Task,"Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you guys can have a look at that if you want . "
C,Task,"That's groovy . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Uh can I have "
C,Task,"Well I like the feel of it comm I like the feel of it . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
D,Minor,"Um that one is "
B,Other,"Oh sorry s "
D,Task,"Oh no comm it's delicate . "
C,Task,"At Oh dear . "
D,Task,"That's that's already got its stand that one . "
D,Task,"That's it stand . "
C,Task,"Alright comm okay . "
D,Task,"It does also lie flat comm "
D,Task,"but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . "
C,Task,"Okay comm brilliant mm . "
D,Task,"Um the black on the back is the slogan . "
C,Task,"Okay comm nice and obvious there comm "
D,Task,"Uh yeah comm that "
D,Task,"Well comm we did think of that . "
C,Task,"if it's standing up comm I guess comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm if it's standing up it's it's on there comm "
D,Task,"but also we're gonna have the company name on the front comm which is the little black kind of line in the middle . "
C,Task,"Oh right comm okay comm brilliant . Like that from its centre . "
D,Task,"So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . "
D,Task,"These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . "
D,Task,"We n were weren't sure about putting them there comm because um i it's it kind of could get bashed . "
C,Task,"Where you're comm yeah comm uh were you're holding it kind of "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Well comm if you hold it comm "
D,Task,"you can you all can hold it comm "
D,Minor,"is "
D,Task,"it does actually feel quite ergonomic comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"if you've got small hands . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Um comm obviously I don't think that's real sized . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"It would have to be a bit bigger . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm scale model comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Um that's a speaker at the top comm "
D,Task,"so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Um and "
D,Task,"um then the buttons . "
D,Task,"Yeah kind of self-explanatory comm just buttons whenever you need them . "
D,Task,"Tried to keep it simple . "
D,Task,"Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . "
D,Task,"We used those . "
D,Task,"And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . "
C,Task,"Alright comm excellent . "
D,Task,"It's not in the traditional place comm "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"but um it's quite an obvious place . "
C,Task,"It's out of the way as well comm I suppose comm so . "
C,Task,"Excellent . "
D,Other,"So there we go "
D,Task,"and and um we have the banana-based one too . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"This one is uh comm I suppose for the younger audiences . "
C,Task,"Okay "
A,Task,"A a more friendly type of "
C,Task,"comm so so Barney the banana . "
A,Task,"Right comm right . "
A,Task,"It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or "
C,Task,"Ah excellent comm just what we need . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Say it for the camera . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Right comm right . "
C,Task,"Cool yeah . "
C,Task,"Well comm nice to have uh options at least . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"'Kay and "
D,Elicit,"So are there any um improvements or issues or "
A,Task,"It won't stand . "
C,Task,"Oh there are issues comm oh there are issues . "
A,Task,"Just let it lie down comm "
A,Task,"it wont stand . "
C,Task,"Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Uh comm let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . "
C,Task,"Um unfortunately "
C,Task,"the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons comm uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Minor,"So we have to "
A,Elicit,"What's on the uh on the left ? "
C,Other,"rea Sorry comm "
C,Task,"I've accidentally highlighted somehow "
C,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"There we go . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Oh god comm "
D,Other,"Ooh . "
C,Elicit,"why is it doing that ? "
C,Other,"There we go . "
C,Task,"So basically comm um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape comm but just have it flattened . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"More like a traditional remote control . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"And by doing so "
C,Other,"Oh no comm hold on . "
C,Task,"Doesn't save us quite as much . "
C,Task,"I don't know what's going on with this again . "
A,Elicit,"W why is the uh double curved two of them ? "
C,Task,"Oh comm good point . "
B,Task,"And double curve on both sides ? "
C,Minor,"Um . "
B,Minor,"Curve . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm this is double-curve comm "
C,Task,"That's sort of curve in and out . "
B,Elicit,"no ? "
B,Task,"This is double-curve . "
A,Minor,"Is i "
B,Minor,"It "
B,Task,"This one is single curve . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"'Cause this is single curve comm "
B,Task,"this is curved on both sides . "
B,Task,"So double-curve . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"I think it means double curved as in um "
D,Task,"Like an S_ shape . "
C,Task,"like uh a single curve on that bottom half comm and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay comm I might be wrong though . "
B,Elicit,"Like this comm one curve on this side comm one curve on that side . "
C,Task,"I don't think that counts as a curve comm I think that's just a shape . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"A curvature is like the this case . "
B,Minor,"Maybe . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there comm right . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"got two of them "
C,Task,"and why why I've got it two comm I don't know comm "
C,Task,"I can't seem to select any more however . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Well we can work around that "
A,Minor,"um "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"Right . No . "
A,Task,"Cut things out . "
A,Elicit,"But you think it should be one . "
C,Task,"It's meant to be one comm yeah comm "
C,Task,"I don't know why I put two in there comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"but um "
C,Task,"Hold on till I find it comm "
C,Task,"I think this shift button might be stuck again . "
C,Task,"No maybe the shift button's stuck in . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Um okay comm so that would take away three comm which would give us "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Should "
C,Task,"Oh that's fine . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm so we're "
C,Task,"Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
C,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"So we could even add something . "
C,Task,"We cou Oh not quite comm have the scroll-wheel comm unfortunately . "
A,Other,"We should fire the accountants . "
C,Other,"What ? "
A,Other,"Fire the accountants . "
A,Task,"Ah yeah comm we could add things . "
A,Task,"Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell comm where you're starting from comm and then use the arrow keys . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Does that work ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I know comm that just extends it as well . "
A,Task,"No mm . "
B,Task,"Uh you can do one thing . "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"You just select one box outsi "
B,Task,"yeah comm this box . "
B,Task,"Then move it with the help of this "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"It One of the buttons is sticking comm I don't know . "
B,Minor,"Just uh just uh "
B,Other,"Okay comm just a minute . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"No input comm like this . "
B,Task,"Shift . "
B,Task,"No it's not . "
C,Task,"No comm it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck comm or something . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's not working . "
A,Elicit,"Is it the other shift button maybe ? "
B,Minor,"Should we ask Meli "
B,Task,"Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ? "
C,Task,"No that's fine . "
C,Task,"Um we've worked out what it would be anyway . "
A,Elicit,"Did you try both shift buttons ? "
A,Task,"It could be the other side . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Cancel . Piss off . "
A,Task,"That's too bad . "
C,Task,"Oh well comm never mind . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"Right comm so that's finances "
C,Minor,"and I dunno what we "
C,Elicit,"what could we reckon we could add ? "
C,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Well maybe we could add something comm "
D,Minor,"but maybe if "
D,Minor,"What do you th "
C,Task,"Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So "
D,Task,"We're trying to save money comm so . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money comm if we don't have to . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But if there is anything you think we've missed out there comm then comm you know comm feel free to add it . "
D,Minor,"Maybe "
D,Task,"I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front comm "
D,Task,"because it's not in an ideal place right now . "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well that's that's uh "
C,Task,"Okay comm so project evaluation . "
C,Task,"We have under twelve Euros fifty . "
C,Elicit,"Project process comm how do we think that went ? "
C,Elicit,"Are we happy ? "
A,Other,"Oh . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah I think we have a a winning product . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Evaluation . "
C,Other,"Oh we've been writing this up for m months . "
D,Task,"I think it went quite smoothly . "
C,Elicit,"Uh room for creativity comm were we happy with that ? "
D,Task,"W I think we were very creative . "
C,Task,"No comm I mea I think it means sort of individually . "
D,Task,"Oh right comm okay . "
C,Elicit,"Yes comm no comm maybe ? "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Okay . Groovy . "
C,Minor,"So uh we're just gonna . "
C,Minor,"Uh yeah comm okay . "
C,Elicit,"Teamwork ? "
C,Elicit,"Leadership comm "

D,Task,"Yeah comm everyone got enough input comm I think . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh and well means comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm we "
C,Other,"The technical stuff was brilliant . "
C,Other,"Let's buy more . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh Right . Um "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"These pens are are neat though . "
C,Task,"I don't know what comm new ideas found comm means comm to be honest . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm these are new ideas comm like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . "
B,Task,"We discussed all the new ideas comm "
B,Task,"but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals comm we couldn't use these comm "
B,Task,"but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"These are new ideas we And new shapes comm everything "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Mm 'kay . Groovy . "
B,Minor,". At le "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So just general thumbs up for all of us then . "

D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Right comm right . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Other,"Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work . "
A,Task,"Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay . "
C,Other,"Whoops . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm maybe . "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"Does it go back in comm does it ? "
C,Task,"Reusable . "
A,Minor,"Something we should get . "
C,Task,"I don't know what this is but it's really really annoying . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"Uh Brian comm have you have you finished ? "
C,Other,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"Um I have comm yes . "
B,Task,"Uh mine needs also this . "

A,Task,"Oh ok "
C,Task,"It didn't bother to tell me that on this "
B,Minor,"S "
C,Task,"thing . "
C,Other,"Is it ? "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh is the project evaluated comm that is mine . "
C,Task,"Doesn't tell me . "
C,Task,"Oh you're doing that . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We evaluated ourselves comm we thought we were great . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Other,"Mm comm love to eat that now . "
A,Other,"Anybody "
D,Task,"Kind of a green banana now . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Clay covered banana . "
D,Minor,"It's "
D,Task,"this as well comm "
D,Other,"sorry comm "
D,Task,"we forgot to mention "
D,Task,"it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex comm new material that we've got . "
C,Task,"O okay comm "
D,Minor,"I've got . "
C,Other,"hold on . "
A,Elicit,"blue . "
C,Other,"I wonder w which cell do I want . "
A,Task,"It's fun to touch . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay comm I didn't realise you had that bit . "
D,Task,"Oh could you pass the tomato please . "
B,Minor,"So . "
D,Other,"Sorry . Thank you . "
B,Task,"So now is the final evaluation comm final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"How we are going to "
B,Minor,"means uh at what standard what standard "
B,Task,"whether it meets our standards or not . "
B,Minor,"How mu "
B,Task,"What rating we will give to these products . "
B,Task,"So of course this is will be a team work comm "
B,Task,"w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . "
B,Task,"We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements comm whether it meets the user requirements or not comm this product . "
B,Task,"Then trends comm whether it is as fashion trends or not ? "
B,Task,"Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . "
B,Task,"Then marketing strategy of the company . "
B,Task,"As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market comm "
B,Task,"not only in terms of providing quality products comm not only in pro providing latest technologies comm but also in terms of providing environmental s "
D,Other,"Sorry . "
D,Other,"Sorry comm "
D,Task,"carry on . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"but also in terms of providing environmental safe products comm "
B,Task,"uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I'm having this scale this scale comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"so we have to do it on a board . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Alright comm okay . "
C,Elicit,"The board working again comm is it ? "
B,Minor,"the user requirem I think . "
A,Elicit,"Do we have the uh the marker for the board ? "
D,Minor,"Um . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"There it is . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Minor,"So . "
B,Task,"So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"First of all uh comes user requirement . "
B,Task,"So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . "
B,Minor,"I I will "
B,Elicit,"first I would like to have your views comm "
B,Elicit,"what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"I think "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it did . "
D,Task,"It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . "
B,Minor,"S "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um so . "
C,Task,"When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ comm "
D,Task,"Does it work ? "
C,Task,"so yeah comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . So . "
C,Task,"of course we haven't actually got a working model yet . "
B,Elicit,"So what do you think you will personally give . "
D,Task,"I would say seven . "
B,Task,"Seven . Uh . "
D,Elicit,"Seven is good comm yeah comm isn't it ? "
D,Minor,"I can't "
D,Other,"True or false ? "
D,Task,"No sorry tr one is true . "
C,Task,"One comm yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Uh one is means highest ranking comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"okay . "
B,Task,"But I think highest ranking is seven comm "
C,Task,"No it's it's like true is one end comm and false is the oth "
B,Elicit,"or one ? "
A,Task,"No that's false . "
B,Task,"Okay comm right right . "
D,Task,"Okay comm so one . "
B,Task,"So it's one for from your point of view . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
B,Elicit,"And what do you say our Industrial Expert ? "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"It's hard to know . "
A,Task,"I I give it a two . "
B,Minor,"Uh d you can you can tell on on the like "
B,Task,"I think she has given her views on the basis of design comm because she was our i Interface Expert . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But you can give your views based on technology comm "
B,Elicit,"whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? "
A,Task,"Um yeah comm I think i it might even exceed it um . "
A,Task,"But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"I'm gonna give it a two . "
B,Other,"Two . "
A,Task,"Two . "
B,Elicit,"And what about uh you comm Brian ? "
C,Task,"Oh comm I'll go for a one . "
B,Task,"You will go for one . "
C,Task,"Basic requirements but of the pro of the project . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh for me personally it is everything fine comm "
B,Task,"it may be having good design comm it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise comm price-wise comm "
B,Elicit,"but there is one thing which limits the customers comm "
B,Task,"like we are having only two comm three designs comm "
B,Task,"like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange comm "
D,Minor,"Mm "
B,Minor,"and "
D,Task,"yellow . "
B,Task,"Uh yeah comm lower end . "
C,Minor,"Yeah th "
B,Task,"And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"But if a person doesn't like banana comm or orange comm you are limiting him . "
C,Minor,"Come on that was the tha "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"No comm don't buy our product comm because we are l we like this only . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So we are showing our preference for particular fruits comm "
B,Task,"two or three kinds rather comm "
B,Minor,"and "
C,Other,"Being fruitist . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Is that no is that not trends ? "
B,Minor,"So . "
B,Task,"Uh no comm uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that comm "
B,Task,"because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits comm they give a range of products comm a range of shapes comm "
B,Task,"like if we see comm look at the smallest thing comm toffee chocolates comm they give a variety of different things . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Some children like to buy banana shape comm some apple shape comm some even pineapple shape comm some orange shape . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So you can what shape a person will like . "
B,Task,"So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . "
B,Task,"And by limiting them comm we are limiting our sales comm limiting our profit also . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"But in electronics comm I think comm it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . "
D,Task,"I think comm you know comm if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from comm a company'll have two or three choices comm but they're different designs . "
D,Task,"We were coming up with one product . "
B,Task,"Uh maybe . Okay "
B,Task,"but I will I will personally won't give it beyond three . "
D,Task,"No comm I mean uh obviously your opinion comm "
D,Minor,"I'm just trying to "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So we can "
C,Task,"He's a tough cookie . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm on an average we can think three comm four sevenths comm maybe . "
B,Elicit,"Three or four ? "
B,Task,"Uh comm no sorry comm "
B,Task,"it should be "
C,Task,"Six . Five or six . "

D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Well um going on uh the specifications that we had comm that fruit and vegetables are quite popular comm and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons comm I would give it um comm "
D,Task,"well comm because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at comm that that looks cool comm you know comm "
D,Task,"so I would actually give it a three . "

D,Task,"That's fine . "
B,Minor,"Uh "

A,Task,"but it's missing the screen comm as we said comm "
A,Task,"um but it does have the push-buttons comm or the scroll-buttons comm "
A,Task,"um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . "
A,Task,"So I give it a a four . "

B,Minor,"because that wha people now "
B,Task,"our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised comm like clothes comm shoes comm and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables comm or getting them or showing some association with them . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
