A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"So comm "
A,Minor,"So comm uh now "
D,Other,"Hi Christa . "
A,Minor,"it's the "
A,Other,"Hi Sammy . "
A,Task,"It's the detail design meeting comm "
A,Other,"so we're going "
A,Task,"last meeting . "
A,Task,"So um comm first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . "
A,Task,"Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . "
A,Minor,"Then comm w we "
D,Other,"Yes . "
B,Other,"Yes . "
A,Task,"And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible "
B,Other,"And chocolate ? "
A,Task,"and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . "
A,Task,"And that's all . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Okay . So first comm let's uh see the prototype . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh comm here we have our prototype model . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . And you have some slides then ? "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm we have also some slides . "
B,Task,"Yes comm and place some slides . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Uh so in which uh "
C,Minor,"In "
B,Task,"Uh comm participant three . Prototype . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm okay . Mm . "
C,Other,"Five . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm so "
C,Minor,"Him . "
B,Task,"this is our remote control . "
B,Task,"It's a r working prototype . "
B,Task,"You can use it now by switching all these buttons . "
B,Other,"So first comm I present as we came to this perfect model comm "
B,Other,"and then we'll give some technical specifications . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"That's well comm so that's that . "
B,Task,"Please comm next slide . "
B,Task,"We analysed all the fruits "
B,Task,"and contacted NASA comm "
B,Minor,"and uh made some real good "
A,Other,"MASA ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"If you can see this comm and the stars are showing that . And um comm s society will accept that . For sure . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And making some analysis of different fruits comm we choose the ultimate form comm ultimate colours comm and uh ultimate smell of it . "
B,Task,"S please comm next slide . "
B,Task,"But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea comm "
B,Task,"'cause it's the most of the moder the m the modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs comm "
B,Task,"so please press something . "
B,Task,"And as I said comm it's perfect . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Please press it . "
C,Other,"Experience . Explanat "
B,Task,"Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an s such a r such a device . "
D,Task,"Such a nice thing . "
C,Minor,"See this . "
B,Other,"So you can touch it with your hands . "
D,Elicit,"Can I ? "
D,Minor,"Ho-ho . "
B,Task,"Sure . Yes . "
C,Minor,"You can "
D,Minor,"imitating flatulence] "
A,Task,"What do you say ? "
B,Minor,"N "
D,Other,"It says "
B,Task,"You must say it . "
D,Minor,"I will uh "
C,Task,"Spongy . "
D,Task,"I'll buy it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"One day . "
D,Task,"If I if I need so . "
A,Minor,"He "
D,Task,"Hopefully my daughter will like it . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Y and we got the answer . "
B,Task,"Uh comm it is comm yes comm of course . "
D,Task,"Yes comm of course . Of c course . "
B,Task,"comm please next slide . "
B,Task,"Um comm this is a prototype . "
B,Other,"You can have a look at it comm "
B,Task,"and That's all I wanted to say . "
D,Minor,"Ah . "
B,Task,"Now it's technical specification by our colleague . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Oh comm there is a button missing . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"This this is really flexible . "
C,Task,"You can add your buttons . "
D,Task,"It's in option . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So function comm mm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So comm as we discussed comm we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . "
C,Task,"And so comm we have buttons and using L_C_D_ comm or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ comm and then do on and off . "
C,Task,"Then you ha you'll have volume control . "
C,Task,"So comm you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . "
C,Task,"And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like comm m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ comm or you don't want you can just use normal button . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And we have speech recognition . "
C,Task,"Here you have microphone comm and then it date records your voice comm and then it try to recognise . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"And it can also do the action . "
C,Other,"And location finder . "
C,Task,"And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"You can just say comm where is my remote control . "
C,Task,"Or uh comm you can just give some nickname to your remote control comm like Bobby . "
D,Task,"Hey comm babe . "
A,Minor,"Bobby . Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And then comm it will say hi . "
D,Other,"Bob . Hey Bob . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm hi comm and then you can use it . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"that's good . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . 'Kay . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"um our team is now fruits . "
C,Task,"Mainly strawberry . "
C,Minor,"So comm you can have "
D,Other,"Oh comm these are strawberries . "
C,Task,"And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches . "
A,Task,"Are colourful . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Material comm we want to stick to titanium . "
C,Minor,"We will send comm we want to "
D,Other,"Fruit smelling spongy titanium . "
D,Task,"I didn't know it exist comm "
D,Task,"but that's great . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm or s "
C,Task,"So comm we want to have simple and perfect shapes comm like I shown in these phones . "
C,Task,"You can have your own designs "
C,Task,"and and you can feel simple designs . "
C,Task,"And you can choose colours on your day for each day comm or even many colours . "
D,Minor,"Ha . "
A,Minor,"Ho-ho . "
D,Elicit,"You mean we can change the colour uh of th "
A,Elicit,"That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ? "
C,Task,"For the L_C_D_ . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah okay comm for the L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"With titanium it's it is silver . "
D,Minor,"Tit titanium is "
B,Task,"We are still working on titanium . "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Uh comm okay . "
B,Task,"So comm r we'll start with L_C_D_ . "
C,Minor,"Mm comm yeah . "
B,Task,"You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm Bob comm please . Tuesday colour . "
A,Task,"Hey comm you know you're theme today . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood comm or s "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Black for Sunday . "
C,Task,"And you can have many colours on weekends . Or "
A,Minor,"And w wait comm "
A,Elicit,"wh what are the strawberries for ? "
D,Elicit,"On the L_C_D_ ? "
C,Minor,"Huh ? "
A,Minor,"Wh wh "
D,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Ah comm these are like sensors . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Of course . "
D,Other,"What do you think ? "
B,Task,"That's location sensors . "
D,Other,"Strawberry sensors . "
D,Task,"Very useful . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Strawberries . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for "
A,Minor,"Ah . "
D,Task,"Lounge meeting . "
C,Elicit,"So comm if you are vegetarian or you have any options comm please let us know . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm and we can just some strawberry first . Um "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Alright . Good . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"Oops . "
C,Minor,"S "
D,Task,"So comm huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm . "
C,Elicit,"So comm any specific questions for "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"we'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into "
D,Task,"It makes sense . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Let's make a party first maybe . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Then we can discuss "
C,Minor,"We can "
A,Task,"W Who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in ? "
D,Minor,"So uh comm this is "
C,Task,"Yeah comm then we can have how much for how money is left . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"What a design . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Uh comm so "
D,Other,"It's my turn . "
A,Minor,"Let's uh comm "
A,Task,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Let's see if this Yeah comm if you meet the evaluation criterion . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Oops . "
C,Other,"Fudge . "
D,Task,"Yeah . So comm evaluation please . "
D,Minor,"So . "
D,Task,"You made a very nice prototype comm "
D,Task,"and um comm I think comm we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it comm if it fulfils our what we want to do comm and things like that . "
D,Minor,"So mm Uh comm "
D,Task,"next slide comm please . "
D,Task,"As you know comm before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control comm it's very important to first verify if it makes sense comm if we have a chance to sell it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh comm so we need to evaluate it um comm try to do it in a constative way comm and as much as we can . "
D,Minor,"To "
D,Task,"so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . "
D,Task,"One meaning that comm ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion comm whatever it is . "
D,Task,"And seven meaning comm no it doesn't fulfil at all . "
D,Task,"And we're all l going to list all the criterion . "
D,Task,"I'm going to go to that next slide comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . "
D,Task,"And then we are just going to have an average comm which will give us the value of our uh remote control . "
D,Task,"So comm maybe we can have a look at the criteria ? "
C,Other,"Fancy . "
D,Task,"So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important . "
D,Task,"Of course comm this can be discussed comm but let's let's see comm "
D,Task,"so let's vote . "
D,Task,"So we have fancy here "
D,Task,"and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm what's is really "
D,Elicit,"what do you think comm is it fancy ? "
C,Task,"Uh comm it's really "
A,Task,"Uh comm I think that fancy comm we can say it is fancy . "
D,Elicit,"It is very very fancy . "
D,Elicit,"Or have you ever seen something like that ? "
A,Task,"Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
D,Elicit,"What do you think ? "
A,Elicit,"Uh what do you think ? "
B,Task,"Feel the weight . "
D,Minor,"Is it "
D,Task,"The weight is later . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Oh . "
B,Other,"Really . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"Now we're "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"We're on the fanciness now . "
D,Task,"I think it's quite fancy . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"It's uh "
C,Task,"We can give at least five or six comm seven . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm so "
D,Task,"No it's it's one . "
A,Task,"It's in the other . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm o one means it's comm yes comm a very fancy and seven mean no at all . "
C,Other,"Oh comm Oh . So Oh comm okay . Yeah comm okay . Oh comm okay . So "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"So it's one or two . "
D,Elicit,"What do you think ? "
A,Task,"Two . "
C,Task,"M maybe two . "
A,Task,"Let's say two comm yeah . "
D,Other,"Two ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Two . Two . "
D,Other,"So here comm two . Up . "
D,Task,"Then we have uh technology . "
C,Other,"Technology . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Um "
D,Elicit,"So comm what about technology ? "
D,Task,"We have uh we have speech recognition comm "
D,Task,"we have location based comm "
C,Task,"And we have L_C_D_ . "
D,Task,"we have L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"So you change colours . "
A,Task,"Change colour of t "
D,Task,"Change colour comm "
D,Task,"I mean that's very "
C,Task,"Useful . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"Quite "
A,Minor,"I think it's a "
D,Task,"d I think it's a one for that comm at least . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Uh "
C,Other,"It's silly . "
D,Task,"At least a one comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
D,Task,"Robustness comm uh-huh . "
C,Task,"Uh comm still we need to cha "
D,Task,"So let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away . "
A,Minor,"Um "
D,Elicit,"Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? "
D,Task,"Uh comm maybe not the prototype . "
A,Task,"The strawberries "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm it "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Let's try . "
D,Other,"Oh my god . "
C,Task,"Maybe strawberry . "
D,Task,"Okay comm we just lost one strawberry . "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Elicit,"Not at all ? "
B,Task,"How can I say this . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we can easily plug it . "
B,Task,"It's still it's still working comm "
B,Task,"and your daughter got a bonus . "
D,Other,"It is "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"A strawberry . "
D,Task,"So it's not so bad . "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
D,Task,"I um uh I would say three . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"But it's too . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah comm that does make sense comm yeah ? "
A,Task,"It's um robust comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Useful ? "
D,Task,"Useful . "
D,Elicit,"Well comm so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"So I don't know . "
D,Task,"These buttons are uh It not clear . "
A,Other,"Oh comm yeah comm lets me try . "
D,Task,"But you have at least uh next produce . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"What is uh next comm please ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm channel . "
C,Task,"I this is volume control and channel changes . "
D,Minor,"Uh comm it depends on the "
C,Task,"These are the main "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And you can uh do di two sites ? "
C,Minor,"You "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . "
A,Task,"Okay comm also . "
D,Task,"So but comm for instance comm because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control comm touch screen comm you cannot go to channel twenty five directly . "
C,Minor,"So if you don't want "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm um yeah . "
A,Task,"You can comm by using the "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You can . "
D,Elicit,"Directly . "
B,Minor,"You go you "
B,Minor,"So comm the basic mode "
A,Task,"You c push here the the "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"So that's simple . "
B,Task,"The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"With two buttons comm you do this like uh volume up comm volume down . "
D,Other,"Oh comm it's a jog dial comm okay . "
D,Other,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"And channel . "
B,Task,"Or if you go to the site comm it's channel up channel down . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"And if you want to make to s twenty-five comm you push on this . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"You can select . "
B,Task,"You select twenty comm you select five . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"That's it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah mm . "
D,Task,"It's much longer than that that being two two five comm no ? "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Elicit,"Don't you think so ? "
D,Task,"May not okay comm we can go . That's uh You're right . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah . "
D,Task,"That's it's less uh Yeah . "
D,Task,"But it's it's nice comm because people anyway don't go there . "
D,Minor,"But "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . Yeah mm . "
D,Elicit,"So what do you think for it comm usefulness ? "
C,Minor,"So comm d Yeah comm we need to address we want "
D,Task,"Seems to be useful . "
C,Task,"we only address two main functions here "
C,Task,"and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So "
A,Task,"Let me understand well comm "
C,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"because I'm not sure "
A,Elicit,"that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . "
D,Task,"Both . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Up down or left right . Yeah . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Up . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah . And which what is that ? "
D,Minor,"That "
B,Task,"It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Task,"This is jog wheel . "
A,Other,"Okay comm okay . It's a kind Oh comm okay okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Um comm "
B,Task,"Like comm selecting the menus . "
C,Task,"see in L_C_D_ comm like you will have blocks and you select which one . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
A,Task,"Oh oh okay comm great . "
D,Task,"I would say then uh "
A,Task,"Now it's looks us useful . "
D,Task,"Two or three ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Two or three ? "
C,Task,"Two comm maybe . "
D,Task,"Two . "
D,Task,"Okay comm two . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So size and weight . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Is it the the the effective size and weight that the "
D,Elicit,"Is it uh real size comm real weight ? "
D,Minor,"Or Because it "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's size al almost "
D,Elicit,"Size is going to be that comm yeah ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"because it is "
D,Minor,"Uh comm and and "
C,Task,"The weight will be bit lighter . "
C,Task,"We will s We use titanium . "
B,Task,"Sure comm "
B,Task,"without titanium alloy comm it's going to be light . "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"It's going to be lighter comm "
D,Task,"because this seems to be very heavy f I mean comm "
B,Task,"Of course . "
C,Task,"Heavy . Yeah . "
D,Other,"for my daughter comm for instance . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Not sure if uh she can use it . "
C,Task,"But sides uh comm the sides should be okay . . Yeah "
D,Task,"So comm should be okay . "
C,Minor,"mm . "
D,Task,"Up to three for that comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
D,Task,"because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh "
B,Task,"Okay . Okay . "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Colour and shape . "
A,Task,"Uh-oh . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"so colour comm it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"But um comm it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"The case is silver titanium comm no ? "
D,Task,"It's a it's going to be titanium . Okay comm okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That's nice . "
A,Task,"Let's imagine . "
D,Task,"I think it's good . Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And what about the strawberries on the top ? "
A,Task,"I'm not convince . "
D,Other,"Yahoo . "
A,Other,"But maybe I'm not trendy . But comm uh "
D,Task,"Well y you know comm it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . "
C,Minor,"Oh . Yeah comm yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but uh uh they're not useful . "
D,Elicit,"So "
A,Minor,"I I mean it that's uh "
C,Minor,"So maybe comm I think "
D,Minor,"Uh comm I think usefulness is m as as "
D,Task,"I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm well "
D,Task,"Whether it's fancy or not now comm it we have to decide . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Um "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"But this "
A,Task,"I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful . "
D,Minor,"If it's "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"So comm that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm well then it's bit difficult to use . "
C,Minor,"Not like this d "
C,Task,"We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction comm too . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"But the n "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So comm maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges comm stuff for strawberries and different colours . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"So it's "
D,Task,"So comm it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh "
C,Minor,"Even "
A,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"These buttons "
A,Task,"I'm not sure uh why "
A,Task,"uh if it was like this "
C,Task,"But it looks really not really good . "
A,Minor,"I It's n "
C,Minor,"I mean comm the f "
A,Task,"no comm "
A,Task,"it's not fancy any more . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So these are kind of rubber things . "
C,Task,"Even if you lose one you can just put whatever . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"And "
C,Task,"Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits comm and "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Other,"And different routes . Okay comm I see what "
B,Minor,"Moreover comm moreover "
B,Task,"it covers it covers all the end goals . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Even if it is comm you know comm it's very rounded comm "
B,Task,"but still you got some rubber fruit here comm "
B,Task,"and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we've yeah "
C,Task,"we have sensors here and so here and here comm "
C,Minor,"so we just "
A,Task,"Also . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"so even if you don't put comm it works . "
C,Task,"But this is really fancy . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I suggested three . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Because uh comm everybody s doesn't seem to be convince comm "
D,Minor,"although it's quite "
B,Task,"Okay . Okay . "
D,Task,"You have good arguments . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And uh the last one is adaptive . "
D,Task,"This is not r maybe not as important as the other one comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ? "
B,Other,"Sure comm sure comm just look at it . "
D,Task,"Great . "
B,Other,"It's full adaptable . "
D,Other,"Fully adaptable . "
A,Minor,"Wow comm that's a "
B,Other,"Yeah comm you can fit it into your palm comm you know . "
D,Minor,"That's "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"So you can fit into your palm comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Yea "
D,Minor,"That "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"What else can we need ? "
C,Minor,"You can "
D,Other,"You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm it's fudge titanium . You know . "
D,Task,"It's fudge comm yeah comm yeah . "

A,Task,"But you don't need a battery ? "
B,Task,"to make electricity . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"that you don't need a battery . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "

A,Minor,"But um "
A,Elicit,"it's like the hand dynamo comm no ? "
C,Task,"Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand "
