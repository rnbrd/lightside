A,Other,"Well hi everyone again . "
B,Other,"Hello . "
C,Other,"Hello . "
D,Other,"Hello "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Other,"like before we uh I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"and so here we go . "
A,Task,"Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um "
B,Task,"Designer . "
A,Task,"designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote "
A,Task,"and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_ . "
A,Task,"It should have nine channel buttons comm a next button comm volume buttons comm subtitle buttons comm switch to control features comm colour contrast comm sharpness etcetera . "
A,Task,"It should have a memory switch comm a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . "
A,Task,"Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Should be child friendly design with few buttons comm "
A,Task,"colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . "
A,Task,"Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose . "
A,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"And she was challenged on that point "
A,Task,"that's right . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"But uh her very f personal favourite really she comm she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . "
A,Task,"The industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue . "
A,Task,"She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong comm not using any harmful materials comm should be recyclable and should be colourful . "
A,Task,"Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . "
A,Task,"She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . "
A,Task,"Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor comm diode transistor comm resonator comm "
A,Task,"and if possible a rechargeable battery . "
A,Task,"Uh and of course a circuit board . "
A,Task,"And how it would works comm you press the button comm the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification "
A,Task,"and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider . "
A,Task,"She would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip "
A,Task,"uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . "
A,Task,"Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . "
A,Task,"The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition comm has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small comm easy to use and it should be eye catching . "
A,Task,"From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . "
A,Task,"To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . "
A,Task,"Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . "
A,Task,"So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . "
A,Task,"Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . "
A,Task,"She feels that's really what people want today . "
A,Task,"And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser comm "
A,Task,"the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip comm "
A,Task,"should be trendy design comm compact and strong comm "
A,Task,"and should have buttons . "
A,Task,"And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . "
A,Task,"Now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Just the look like comm "
B,Other,"the button part I'll explain . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh so this is our what uh we have made . "
C,Task,"This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"um and it's "
C,Task,"it's blue in colour "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"so it is a uh uh a looks-wise it is beautiful . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh and also compact in shape . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . Good . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Other,"oops comm "
C,Other,"sorry . "
D,Other,"You used to have all the buttons "
C,Minor,"Um yeah and um uh "
C,Task,"the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic "
C,Task,"and uh w which which is s strong "
C,Minor,"um uh and also uh for the "
C,Task,"Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber "
C,Minor,"um and als "
D,Task,"Oh that's good comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"no comm that's nice and friendly . "
C,Task,"Yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And then um uh for the for the led comm for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and it's a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"And "
C,Task,"and the button button's part uh will be explained by F Francina . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Now the um "
B,Task,"we decided upon including certain features on our remote . "
B,Task,"Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm okay comm mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
A,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Now uh we have included the switch on and off button . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Now we have included another feature that is the mute button "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"on the side of the model . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Then we have included one to nine buttons "
B,Task,"for controlling the programmes the different channels . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button . "
A,Other,"What kind of button ? "
B,Task,"Menu button . "
A,Other,"Menu ? "
A,Other,"Uh menu th menu comm uh one one . "
B,Task,"Yes comm menu "
D,Task,"Menu button . "
B,Task,"At the centre "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour "
B,Task,"and this is the menu button which will control the colour comm sharpness comm brightness "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Of the screen . Mm comm mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"of this uh picture . "
B,Task,"We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . "
B,Task,"Now this is uh a special comm special feature which we have included . "
B,Task,"Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible "
B,Task,"so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel comm if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . "
B,Task,"It will take the user to the previous and the next channel "
B,Task,"so this is a swapping button . "
D,Elicit,"The next channel in the numeric pattern comm or "
B,Task,"No comm swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap comm this button . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Okay comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"And at the end comm it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So this is our proposed model . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Now the marketing expert has to "
C,Task,"Tell comm yeah . "
B,Task,"give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm well um "
D,Minor,"what "
D,Task,"what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb comm "
B,Minor,"Yes comm yes . "
D,Task,"that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand comm yeah ? "
A,Elicit,"Yes the buttons are all raised comm right ? "
D,Task,"The buttons are all raised "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Are raised comm mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around comm turn it upside down comm move it up comm up and down comm "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Or have two hands to operate it comm yeah . "
D,Task,"I really like that . "
D,Task,"You really did a good job on that comm my little designers . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Um and um "
D,Task,"I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . "
D,Task,"That's that's a really good good thing . "
A,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Task,"and it sort of sticks up "
A,Minor,"so that you really "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's great . "
A,Task,"you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah comm mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Abs okay . "
D,Task,"The colour's very attractive . "
D,Elicit,"Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute "
B,Task,"No comm these the front buttons which are here comm are the mute buttons . "
D,Minor,"and "
D,Task,"these mm-hmm "
D,Elicit,"On both sides they're mute ? "
B,Task,"Yes comm yes . "
D,Elicit,"So you can push either one ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter . "
D,Elicit,"And this brings the menu up on the screen ? "
B,Other,"Pardon me ? "
D,Task,"This brings the menu up on the screen "
B,Task,"This is the menu yes comm yes . "
D,Elicit,"and the orange ones are "
B,Minor,"A the the these "
B,Task,"these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes comm "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels . "
D,Task,"F f okay . "
D,Task,"Right comm very good . "
B,Task,"Scroll up or scroll down the channels . "
D,Task,"Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell . "
D,Other,"Okay and now I'm supposed to "
A,Other,"Well comm I have one question "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"uh will there be anything written on the buttons comm like that people know comm or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? "
B,Task,"Yes comm it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . "
C,Other,"Ah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm definitely . "
A,Elicit,"Will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it "
B,Task,"Yes comm which can be easily recognised . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Good point "
D,Task,"because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah of course comm "
C,Minor,"and also "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols comm text or something so that people kn "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah we can "
D,Task,"Symbols on it . Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Text . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Text that we can have on the case itself comm "
C,Minor,"we can "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"That's right . "
C,Task,"it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay comm yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"And "
B,Task,"and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . "
D,Minor,"Mm comm 'kay comm mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"A shell shape . "
D,Task,"For the snail comm yeah comm mm-hmm comm "
A,Minor,"Right comm mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yes comm yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"we have the snail shell . "
C,Minor,"So it is "
B,Task,"Yes comm snail shell . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"He goes right back into his shell . "
C,Minor,"yeah "
C,Minor,"shell . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too "
D,Task,"because the snail is known to be slow "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Y Yes "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"of course comm yeah . "
D,Task,"you know that would comm that would really work . "
A,Elicit,"Now what comm what are our special features for the marketing ? "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual "
D,Task,"I think voice recognition is our big selling point "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And then comm and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use . "
D,Task,"Yep "
D,Task,"uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . "
A,Other,"You know . "
D,Task,"I think we have to comm we have to dwell on on on the appearance . "
A,Task,"Colours . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"We're really gonna have the be the "
A,Task,"Cutest . "
D,Task,"cutest remote control on the block . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So I think we have to play with the image comm "
D,Task,"play with the snail image "
D,Task,"um play with the visual "
D,Task,"and then the voice recognition . "
D,Task,"I think those are the two things to push . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"The look "
D,Task,"and the voice recognition . "
D,Task,"They're gonna be our two selling points . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"now uh having said that "
D,Elicit,"I'm supposed to make a little presentation comm aren't I ? "
A,Task,"No comm now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Now we're gonna talk about financing . "
D,Task,"Ah comm but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something . "
D,Elicit,"No ? "
A,Task,"Well comm there is a production evaluation . "
A,Elicit,"Is that you ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's me . "
A,Task,"But that's after the financing . "
D,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Elicit,"See ? Fi see ? "
D,Other,"Sorry comm sorry . Mm-mm . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Other,"Okay comm we had looks and voice recognition . "
A,Minor,"Okay now on the financing we bring up the "
A,Other,"mm there it is . "
A,Elicit,"Okay uh energy source we say that's battery comm right ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"That's right . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm now . "
A,Task,"So we I guess we use one . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Other,"What ? "
A,Other,"T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . "
A,Task,"Well comm that's nice . "
A,Task,"She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would "
A,Task,"It doesn't work . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
D,Elicit,"Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? Or "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay yeah comm okay comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"let's see . "
A,Task,"Okay comm one comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Other,"Oh go away . "
A,Task,"Um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Uh electronics comm simple chip on print ? "
A,Elicit,"Is that's what we're using ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"One of those ? "
A,Other,"Come on . "
A,Task,"Okay comm one . "
A,Task,"Uh regular chip on print . No . "
C,Minor,"No . "
A,Elicit,"That's all we need comm the one "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"case comm uncurved flat comm single curved comm double curved . "
D,Minor,"Well . "
C,Task,"This is a "
B,Task,"Single curve ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I guess it's double curved . "
A,Task,"Double curved ? "
A,Elicit,"One of those ? "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Case materi s supplements . "
A,Task,"Plastic we said comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"Plastic . "
A,Elicit,"Uh wood comm rubber ? "
D,Task,"Rubber comm because we're gonna have the soft buttons . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh but comm yes but "
C,Task,"I think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material . "
A,Task,"That's just for the case material comm "
B,Task,"Is this for the case ? Yes . "
A,Task,"so special colours though comm we having that comm "
D,Task,"Oh okay comm the mm-hmm comm mm' kay . "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And then we have to interface push buttons . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Scroll wheel comm no . "
A,Task,"Integrated scroll wheel comm "
A,Elicit,"L_C_ display ? "
D,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all comm "
A,Other,"Button . "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm button supplement special colour ? "
B,Minor,"Speci "
B,Task,"Yes "
A,Elicit,"Special form ? "
B,Task,"Yes d we do have special form . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"And special material comm rubber comm wood comm yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Total seven point six whatever that means . "
C,Task,"Uh comm I think that's the price . "
A,Task,"That's the price . "
B,Other,"One two three four five six seven eight nine "
C,Minor,"Maybe it is it just n "
A,Other,"Mm ? "
A,Task,"Eight comm eight point two . "
B,Task,"Nine points comm "
A,Minor,"That's "
A,Other,"hmm ? "
B,Task,"okay comm yes . "
A,Elicit,"Eight point two comm right ? "
A,Minor,"So comm we "
A,Task,"looks like we are well within budget . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"I guess I should save this I suppose comm huh ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Oops . "
A,Other,"Uh-huh huh huh . "
B,Task,"On the desktop . "
A,Task,"I just tried that . "
A,Other,"My documents comm computer . "
C,Task,"AMI . "
A,Task,"My compu Ah oh here it is comm yes . "
C,Task,"AMI should for "
A,Other,"Okay comm fine . Save . "
A,Task,"Okay good comm so that's the good news . "
A,Task,"We gonna be popular . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Minor,"So that uh "
A,Task,"I think financing was pretty simple . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation . "
D,Other,"Okay comm I'll take my file down so you can bring it up . "
D,Task,"'Kay should be able to get it now . "
D,Task,"'Kay comm why don't you move just to the next slide right away . "
A,Elicit,"You wanna go to the next slide ? "
D,Task,"Yeah right away . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay comm well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question comm will it sell ? "
D,Task,"And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups "
D,Task,"and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"We can't accept every suggestion of course comm "
D,Task,"but maybe we just need to get a few . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And show the the prototype to consumer research groups comm "
D,Task,"we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So we have to get some input from those people . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition "
D,Task,"and you know we like it comm we think it's good comm we're gonna get behind it and sell it . "
D,Task,"Um comm next slide please . "
D,Task,"Okay comm now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . "
D,Task,"I wanted the shape to be biomorphic comm I didn't want anything with angles and all square comm I wanted it to be comfy and roundy "
D,Task,"so we we've got that . "
D,Task,"The size is small comm "
D,Task,"the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . "
D,Task,"We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible comm "
D,Task,"we'll have the soft buttons "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and the way this is shaped comm even though it's gonna be hard plastic comm it feels good in your hand "
D,Task,"so that's nice . "
D,Task,"And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . "
D,Task,"So paradoxically the other features comm in other words comm the look comm the feel um and the shape comm that's what people are gonna get in the store . "
B,Minor,"Fee selling . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"They don't have a television in the store comm they can't play with it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Um so they'll be our main selling points . "
D,Minor,"So um "
D,Task,"th those have been fulfilled by your prototype "
D,Task,"and go ahead to the next slide please . "
D,Task,"Okay comm so um the shape um I think is a a one . "
D,Task,"That's really comm really excellent shape . "
D,Task,"The size is small um "
D,Task,"and th these points are in the importance for the comm for the marketing comm these aren't i in how I feel . "
D,Minor,"I think that it's "
D,Task,"I think that it's plenty small enough to sell "
D,Minor,"but I think we're sort of right "
D,Task,"the scale is one to seven . "
D,Task,"I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And our colour I think is great . "
D,Task,"The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . "
D,Task,"And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible . "
D,Task,"And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality comm "
D,Task,"obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else "
D,Task,"so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . "
D,Task,"So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um I just realised one thing . "
D,Other,"Yes . "
A,Task,"In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Other,"Ah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that comm too . "
D,Elicit,"Well comm um we had what comm eight eight euros twenty as our cost ? "
A,Task,"Eight comm eight twenty comm yes . "
C,Task,"Eight twenty so "
D,Task,"And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend . "
C,Task,"We have um four euros comm yeah "
A,Task,"I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Well um that's "
A,Task,"But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished comm as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So um we just have to beware of that . "
A,Task,"I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price comm the the the problem is quality . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Yes comm "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"yes . "
D,Task,"And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway . "

D,Task,"where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here comm but "
A,Task,"Well it's also you can't really try it out "
A,Task,"uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view "

D,Task,"It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product . "
D,Task,"Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe comm heaven forbid comm having another meeting . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But um otherwise I think we're we're ready to go to go with this product . "
D,Elicit,"Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Elicit,"Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? "
C,Minor,"Maybe we can "
B,Task,"We can always improve comm yes . "
C,Task,"yeah comm include some more buttons and uh um "
B,Task,"Yes comm features . "
C,Task,"yeah features . "
C,Task,"We can make the buttons few buttons smaller . "
C,Task,"Uh I think they are quite big comm "
C,Task,"so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm definitely . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Voices . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"So that that's where we're gonna have to do "
D,Task,"maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons comm instead of having two mute buttons . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm definitely comm yeah comm two mu mute buttons . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"And um then maybe we can do something with the um "
D,Task,"the volume control . "
D,Task,"Maybe we can put that all on one button . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget "
B,Minor,"And maybe "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and that we still you know we probably can't comm with this particular item comm we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here "
A,Elicit,"or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? "

A,Task,"Uh comm it's maybe not in the best position in the room "
A,Task,"um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit . "
D,Task,"And we used the slide because it was better positioned . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yes comm I think so comm I think absolutely comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"No . "
