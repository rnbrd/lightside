A,Minor,"So is "
A,Elicit,"Why not save that . "
D,Task,"No comm you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . "
A,Other,"Do you want to replace existing file comm no . "
A,Task,"I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents comm but "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you have to you have to close that window . "
D,Task,"'Cause that's the save one isn't it comm so "
D,Task,"And then find it . "
A,Other,"spreadsheet . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but I've ta uh "
A,Other,"right comm I'll just re-do it . "
A,Task,"That's the easiest way . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Well we've made our prototype anyway . "
C,Task,"We can have a good look at that . "
D,Task,"You pass it round to have a look . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Y no comm it's a slightly curved around the sides . "
D,Task,"Mm very nice . "
C,Task,"Um comm it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . "
C,Task,"And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top . "
D,Task,"So it is comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Cherry would be alright actually . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's a bit more fun comm isn't it ? "
C,Minor,"And it's kinda not really at a kind of "
C,Task,"you think apple comm you think computers comm like Apple Mac . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
B,Task,"we might get a "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Copyright comm yeah . "
D,Elicit,"What's this this one ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm and cherries are fun comm summery . "
D,Elicit,"What's that one there ? "
C,Task,"Ah comm that's the mute . "
D,Other,"Oh comm okay . Right . "
B,Task,"For the M_ . "
C,Task,"It it'd probably have to be labelled mute . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"But um comm we didn't have anything small enough to write . "
B,Minor,"They're thinking "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"For the first time comm well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh comm we just chose simple shapes for all them . "
C,Task,"Um comm the important ones are the volume ones . "
C,Task,"So we made them a bit bigger . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"The mute could possibly be a bit smaller . "
B,Task,"Hum comm you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons comm "
B,Task,"so you've got the volume in orange on design there comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and the the channel is in blue . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"R right . Um comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus . "
A,Task,"all these things have cost implications . "
A,Task,"And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . "
A,Minor,"So However comm I've now . But um comm yeah "
A,Task,"so uh but there would be a cost implication on that comm "
D,Other,"I'll see if I can find them . "
A,Task,"and uh as I suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours comm would be uh open to debate comm I suppose . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm sis "
C,Task,"Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important comm "
D,Minor,"Have "
C,Task,"but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . "
C,Task,"So that's where the colour buttons came from . "
A,Task,"An important consideration . "
A,Minor,"Right comm okay so um "
A,Task,"And the second one underneath would be the idea for the "
B,Task,"Yes comm we'll have the slide-away . "
A,Task,"Right comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Bottom . "
A,Task,"So we've got um detail design meeting . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"So comm we've got prototype presentation comm which we've just done comm "
A,Task,"evaluation criteria comm "
A,Task,"um and finance comm "
A,Task,"so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer comm but um obviously obviously it would . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"But other than that comm we got the red apple . "
A,Task,"We got the buttons "
A,Task,"and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons comm "
B,Minor,"Yes comm yes . "
A,Task,"and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . And the and the cost implication . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"The only snag about this is that uh the cost is probably kind of important . "
A,Task,"So um comm and then the production evaluation comm as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um comm and whether it would uh "
D,Elicit,"So if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ? "
C,Task,"Uh comm that's it . "
B,Minor,"This this is a "
B,Task,"yes comm "
B,Task,"this is our presentation of the prototype . "
D,Minor,"That's the pr "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Right comm so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half Euros . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So comm there's no redesign . "
A,Minor,"So that should uh "
A,Other,"Right comm so comm seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that uh "
B,Task,"Could we get this on the board just so we can see "
B,Elicit,"or do you mean do you have the figures there ? "
D,Task,"we should plug it in . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"'Kay comm Alice . "
B,Minor,"So comm sh "
D,Task,"We could do it as we d go along comm the production costs comm looking at the prototype . "
A,Minor,"Right . . "
B,Task,"'Kay this should be then . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so comm by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source comm we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . "
A,Task,"So comm we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Have a push button interface . "
A,Task,"Okay . W the button supplements . "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Well comm originally comm I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"So the so the real w the real question then would come in . "
A,Elicit,"Do you make all the buttons "
D,Task,"Well do we'll do it on the prototype comm "
A,Minor,"O "
D,Task,"so do two comm "
D,Task,"see how much it is . "
A,Task,"Well comm so we've got one special button form comm which was the apple . "
A,Task,"Everything else is gonna be a standard . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"And then we'd have "
A,Task,"We've got special material comm rubber comm wood comm titanium comm et cetera and that comm "
A,Task,"so comm I was originally comm I was thinking rubber wasn't special comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"but according to this comm maybe it is . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think you just do one comm don't you comm for the "
A,Task,"W I don't know is is is the sort of answer comm "
A,Task,"is that meant to be all sixteen buttons comm "
A,Minor,"and therefore I mean comm what's the op "
A,Task,"The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons comm "
A,Task,"but just to have the one that was soft and spongy comm "
A,Minor,"and therefore "
D,Task,"I think I think it's just it's just a one . Else "
A,Task,"Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the "
A,Task,"So you would only have the one special button that was rubber comm "
A,Task,"whereas the rest would be hard plastic . "
D,Task,"I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material comm rather than per button . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I don't know though . "
A,Minor,"I would "
A,Minor,"Every design change is uh sound] "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"I dunno comm "
A,Minor,"um "
A,Minor,"Okay comm um comm "
A,Task,"if we just had all the buttons as standard comm except for the one red apple comm then that would take care of that comm I guess . "
A,Task,"We'd have one special colour "
A,Task,"and one special button form . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And when I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . As far as I know comm that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"And if "
A,Elicit,"What happened ? "
D,Task,"You've just gone off the window into another one . "
D,Task,"It's on the bottom row . "
C,Task,"Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Now comm right . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so comm but the point would be that if we uh if we just did special "
A,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Elicit,"you were saying that it would be that one comm that you would put in one there . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So that's nine point one there "
B,Task,"so we've got some "
A,Minor,"So it "
A,Minor,"Well comm is it s is "
A,Task,"no comm "
A,Task,"it's nine point seven I've got . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Just give us a bit of "
A,Task,"So comm that would that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons comm then that would be fine . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on . "
C,Minor,"S "
B,Task,"I switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor . "
B,Task,"At the moment we've just got the simple chip comm which costs one . "
B,Task,"Um comm I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing comm which puts up to four ? "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We should be slightly over our budget "
B,Task,"but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard comm and maybe go with the one the special form buttons comm then we could have the speech "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well comm hold on . "
A,Minor,"Um comm if we "
A,Task,"Okay comm that gives us twelve point seven "
B,Task,"So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours comm kept them all the same colour comm then we could have the voice recognition "
A,Task,"But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the "
B,Minor,"without "
A,Other,"Oh comm I see comm "
A,Task,"so just take out the special colour for the apple and "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Um comm . D "
C,Task,"wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? "
C,Task,"You know how you turn that one to a zero comm "
C,Task,"wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"we have to have it "
B,Task,"Oh possibly comm yeah comm yeah maybe . "
C,Task,"so you need both of them ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic . "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"And go for battery instead . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That would give you one less . "
B,Minor,"We should "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"that would save us one comm "
B,Task,"though we'd still be slightly ov "
A,Minor,"But you reckon that "
A,Task,"i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Well comm since it's the through the whole technology type thing comm um comm you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um comm whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker comm voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have . "
B,Task,"And then still have the batteries comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"or whatever they would prefer not uh "
B,Elicit,"You know what I mean ? "
B,Task,"The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them . "
A,Elicit,"But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? "
C,Task,"I think the voice recognition . "
A,Task,"In a sense comm at the moment comm we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two . "
A,Task,"At least . "
A,Task,"Remember that was a minimum requirement . "
A,Task,"The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful comm would be to um make it originally comm we're gonna make it a simple product . "
D,Task,"Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . Makes sense . "
D,Minor,"Okay . Right um comm "
B,Minor,"Okay "
D,Task,"I have a little thing . "
D,Task,"So comm we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven comm isn't it comm with everything we want on . "
A,Minor,". "
A,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Elicit,"do you want that back up ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I just had a presentation to do . "
A,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm . "
D,Minor,"Right okay um comm "
D,Task,"This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . "
D,Task,"And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype comm "
D,Task,"and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . "
D,Task,"And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research comm "
D,Task,"and also finance comm I guess . "
D,Task,"And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven comm "
D,Task,"so if it's neither true nor false comm then that's four . "
D,Task,"So comm I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well comm at the end . "
D,Task,"Um so comm We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . "
D,Task,"Um The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . "
D,Task,"Whether it's easy to use . "
D,Task,"Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . "
D,Task,"And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . "
D,Task,"And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"so I'll go over here . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"So the first one is um comm does the product look and feel fancy . "
D,Other,"So if we do a sort of a one "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Okay comm well we have a single curve comm "
B,Task,"which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Um comm then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel comm which was in at the time . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um comm sorry that'd be considered fancy . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I'd maybe give it a a two . "
D,Minor,"Of but I think "
D,Elicit,"What Is one false comm or is t one true ? "
D,Task,"I forgot . "
C,Task,"One's true . "
D,Task,"One's true comm and okay . Seven's fal "
C,Task,"And a four is neutral . "
D,Task,"Four is neutral comm okay . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"So maybe maybe a two . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"'cause we haven't got the double curve comm "
C,Task,"so we can't like say it's completely true . "
A,Task,"Go for one . Yep . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"But it's pretty close . "
C,Task,"We've got almost everything we can . "
D,Minor,"Okay . Right . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . "
D,Task,"So comm false is seven comm true is one comm and "
D,Task,"So uh say about a two for fancy comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"you think ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm why not not comm "
A,Task,"m m maybe nearer three . "
D,Task,"Okay comm well d you do an average at the end comm I don't know . Um "
A,Minor,"Two three . "
A,Task,"Well comm it's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down comm we've got solar power comm we've got uh various other things you could have comm "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"and we're not going for these options . "
D,Task,"This this is just this is just for like the look . "
D,Task,"Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"so that "
D,Elicit,"so sh should we go for a a two on that ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Elicit,"And I mean comm how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? "
B,Task,"Um comm deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition comm "
B,Task,"and if we had either of those for our budget comm they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . "
D,Minor,"D yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"So comm what about the pr The prototype as it is comm "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"we've got we've got the speech recognition on it comm haven't we . "
B,Task,"But not the kinetic . "
D,Other,"But not the kinetic . "
B,Task,"Like the power . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"'Cause you can't afford that "
A,Task,"w we took that out too . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Minor,"we c ca "
B,Task,"yeah comm "
B,Task,"we can't afford both . "
D,Minor,"Alright comm so "
A,Elicit,"Didn't you ? Or "
D,Minor,"So it doesn't "
D,Minor,"It's pretty "
D,Task,"The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"may is maybe about neutral "
C,Task,"Maybe a three . "
B,Task,"plus it it it's got something comm "
B,Task,"but it hasn't got "
D,Minor,"Okay . Yeah . "
A,Other,"Well comm wait a minute . "
A,Task,"In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . "
C,Task,"I would give it more than a four . "
A,Task,"The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . "
A,Task,"So comm it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . "
D,Minor,"Right comm okay . "
A,Minor,"And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker comm then because that "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"the other functions we've got in are are more at the "
A,Task,"The special material comm the rubber comm wood comm titanium comm et cetera comm if you go for that comm th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six comm "
A,Task,"whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . "
A,Task,"Now you're trying to lose one point two comm "
A,Task,"so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker comm you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery comm to have your uh sample sensor speaker comm "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two comm "
D,Minor,"S "
D,Other,"I'm just gonna check my email . "
A,Task,"which would be come from the button supplements category . "
D,Other,"I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product . "
C,Elicit,"How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? "
C,Task,"Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . "
C,Task,"If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . "
C,Task,"And then it stand the test of time better . "
A,Other,"Um comm interface type um comm "
A,Task,"well plastic rather than rubber . "
D,Minor,"Okay . But I "
A,Task,"That that that would make the significant difference . "
A,Minor,"You could either "
A,Minor,"you could have it "
A,Task,"If you have a in plastic rather than rubber comm then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then comm you could keep your sample sensor comm "
A,Task,"and you'd be looking to take out point two . "
A,Task,"So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom comm "
A,Task,"or your special colour at the bottom . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And that would enable you to to do it . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So it says if we make a slightly more fancy comm then we lose points innovation comm "
B,Task,"and if we make it more innovative innovative comm then we lose points on it being fancy comm so "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Ye "
D,Task,"comm I just read the email again "
D,Task,"and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is comm I think comm "
D,Task,"so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . "
D,Task,"I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or . "
A,Minor,"Well comm okay comm but "
C,Task,"Well comm I suppose it's rubber as it is comm isn't it . "
A,Task,"It's rubber as it is comm yes . "
D,Elicit,"So comm I mean does this need to go up a bit or something comm "
D,Task,"'cause we've got both the both the um the speech "
A,Task,"We got we've we've got thirteen point seven "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and we've got it in at the moment "
A,Task,"and if and basically comm we're going to reduce down from that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But the current one comm you'd say would be fancy comm would be too "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Um comm for for innovation comm so we've got the speech the speech thing comm and "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I would've said about a two as well . "
D,Elicit,"Do you reckon a two ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"two or three . "
C,Task,"I'd be happy with a two . "
D,Task,"Okay . Two . "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Minor,"And the next one is "
D,Other,"I'll have to get it back up now . "
A,Minor,"The next on "
A,Other,"Well comm I can just sing about . "
A,Task,"Easy to use . "
A,Task,"I would've said yes . "
A,Task,"I would go for a one on that at this point in time . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I would say so as well . "
A,Task,"Um comm incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . "
A,Task,"Well comm yeah it certainly has some . "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's got the cherry and the sponginess . "
B,Task,"It does comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,". "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Say about a three maybe ? "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm m um "
C,Task,"Maybe two ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"it was just doing it quite well . "
B,Task,"Um comm I think we're gonna have to lose some of these comm "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"but the moment comm as it stands comm it's um "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I woulda said two would seem reasonable . "
D,Task,"It's a two . "
A,Task,"The product is a recognisable real r uh reaction product ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm this is "
B,Task,"Uh the sensor using all of its all of its products comm all of its buttons comm "
D,Minor,"This "
B,Task,"and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"that's a bit rough at the minute . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing comm as well as having the logo on and all that . "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So sort of Is it sort of a recognisable product . "
D,Task,"Does it fit in with our other other products comm "
D,Task,"which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . "
C,Task,"Uh comm well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine . "
D,Minor,"What do y "
A,Minor,"S "
B,Task,"Also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm it depends which way you look at it . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So we're going for a two comm "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Maybe a kind of three ? "
B,Minor,"Uh d "
D,Task,"Two or three ? "
A,Elicit,"three ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm two or three . "
C,Task,"Well comm the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . "
C,Task,"It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . "
A,Task,"Sure . "
C,Task,"But um comm I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And it does have attributes that other products do . "
C,Task,"Two ? "
C,Task,"Aye . "
C,Task,"Go for it . "
A,Task,"Right comm okay . "
D,Elicit,"Two or three . "
A,Task,"Two . "
D,Minor,"How "
A,Minor,"Right comm come on . "
D,Task,"Two . Okay . "
A,Task,"That's that decided . "
A,Minor,"Right . So "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements comm "
A,Minor,"and then "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"What does what do all them numbers mean then ? "
C,Elicit,"Do we add them up and rate or anything ? "
D,Task,"Yeah we s yeah comm "
D,Task,"I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be "
D,Other,"I'm just gonna do this in my head . "
A,Task,"About a two . "
A,Task,"Two . "
D,Task,"One point eight isn't it or something . "
D,Task,"I think comm anyway . "
D,Task,"So yeah comm pretty close to a two . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm so it's "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"So it's I mean it's pretty good at the moment comm "
D,Task,"but it's gonna get worse comm isn't it . "
D,Task,"But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"So should we get So are definite "
A,Task,"Two b two b two comm yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm so we need to "
A,Task,"Well comm you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements . "
D,Task,"Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances "
A,Task,"Okay comm well I put it back on . "
B,Task,"So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ? "
D,Task,"I'm not sure . "
C,Task,"we'll probably have to re-rate it . "
A,Task,"Yes comm I would've thought so . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"we'll make the adjustments "
B,Task,"and then see how are rates are going . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm so what was it comm "
A,Elicit,"control uh F_ eight comm wasn't it ? "
C,Task,"Ah it's on . "
D,Task,"it's come on already . "
A,Other,"Oh . Oh . How kind . "
A,Minor,"Right comm okay . So comm "
A,Minor,"you can see there that the "
A,Task,"If you want to keep kinetic comm right comm you've got a choice there of going down to battery comm which would save you one . "
A,Task,"You've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker comm which is your big item . "
B,Task,"Oh actually we just have a plastic case comm then we lose two points comm "
A,Task,"That's right . "
B,Task,"which gets us um In right within the budget range . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Which gets you "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think that'd be fine . "
C,Task,"Because that was just a trend comm "
C,Task,"and we do have rubber buttons anyway . "
B,Task,"So that's eleven point seven comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements . "
D,Task,"Different different colours comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case . "
B,Task,"Possibly comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
B,Task,"And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . "
B,Task,"So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of "
A,Elicit,"So we're going for plastic comm yes ? "
D,Task,"Lose a little bit on the fashion comm yeah comm but "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Oh yeah comm and that would now be "
D,Minor,"And then "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's that's within the budget . Um "
B,Minor,"Do we actually have "
B,Elicit,"Do we just have one special uh special forms down here ? "
A,Task,"Well comm uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them . "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"You got special colour . "
A,Task,"Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple comm "
A,Task,"and therefore comm that was the special colour . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think we should just imagine white buttons . "
B,Task,"And we we've we've got we've got enough for another "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"we've got nought point eight left comm "
B,Task,"so we've got enough for another "
A,Task,"Well comm we've got special form . "
A,Task,"Now that would be one button comm "
A,Task,"and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . "
A,Task,"'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm um "
A,Task,"So so no matter how you look at that comm that would be the same . "
B,Minor,"But the but but but the "
A,Task,"The other thing would then be special material comm rubber comm wood comm titanium . "
B,Task,"I think maybe the special colour comm we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . "
A,Other,"Alright . "
A,Task,"So comm special colour comm you want three in there . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"which I think we should "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"they'll still be fine for the for the price . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour "
D,Task,"'cause it's just two supplements comm you know . "
D,Task,"One original colour and then sort of two supplements comm I think maybe . "
A,Task,"That makes sense . "
B,Task,"Okay comm uh that's probably it . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So we only ne we only need two for that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"'Cause I mean these these are moulded . "
D,Task,"The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber comm isn't it . "
A,Task,"Okay . Yeah comm I would agree with that comm I think . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"And we've got special form is the one apple . "
A,Task,"The rest are all standard comm "
A,Minor,"although you could argue that should maybe be "
A,Task,"You were making these buttons down the bottom comm I was presuming comm bigger than the other ones comm "
A,Elicit,"or were you ? "
B,Minor,"Ne uh "
A,Elicit,"Was that the idea ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"the volume ones should stand out a bit . "
B,Task,"Maybe that'll be a second supplement . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm that "
B,Task,"Then there's a spe a second special form . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Minor,"I would have thought that's probably about r well . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Well you got you got twelve . "
D,Unlab,"Okay comm so tha "
B,Task,"So I think that should still be okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's twelve point three comm "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"so we're still within budget on that . Um "
A,Task,"Yep comm that makes sense . "
B,Task,"So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion "
B,Task,"and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it comm "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"but generally speaking comm we've kept the other attributes to the "
A,Task,"I woulda said so . "
A,Task,"Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two . "
B,Minor,"That's without "
D,Minor,"So shall we do a Well comm um "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And specially it definitely could fits the the real product "
B,Elicit,"What was the what's the company name ? "
C,Task,"Real Reactions ? "
A,Task,"Real Reaction produ "
B,Task,"R yeah . Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"I'm not quite sure comm what does that mean ? "
B,Task,"I mean it still seems definitely fit that p "
B,Task,"so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company comm then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm so "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Yep "
D,Task,"So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button comm then maybe they could be a different shape . "
A,Minor,"I would s "
D,Task,"Like we got a cherry one . "
D,Task,"Maybe other ones could be something else shaped . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different seeing as we've got comm you know comm we've made it a a special form comm so "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"You mean of "
D,Task,"And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . "
D,Task,"And it would sort of comm you know comm keep it quite fancy as well comm "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Well you could argue you might do it once a year comm you would change comm "
A,Task,"because at the moment you're making a red apple . "
B,Minor,"Yeah so it's a "
D,Minor,"Well you could "
A,Task,"So next year you could make next year's model the same comm but have it as a a yeah whate whatever comm a lemon . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Whatever fruit was in fashion next year . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm l a lemon lemon or something . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something comm maybe . "
A,Minor,"And that "
A,Minor,"amount "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"So comm we've what have we what have we rid of . "
D,Task,"We got rid of the plastic . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? "
D,Minor,"Is it "
B,Minor,"That yeah comm that was uh "
D,Task,"The rubber . "
B,Task,"that was just about all . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think we've saved quite a bit "
B,Task,"because we've just got the push-button interface comm which is by far the cheapest . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"But uh "
B,Task,"So maybe in a sense not having that comm maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ? "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"And that is like the most standard type of button . "
D,Task,"So I mean comm we've got we got rid of the rubber case comm "
D,Task,"but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form comm and an extra colour for the buttons . "
D,Task,"So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability comm we're pretty much the same comm maybe . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So comm I mean we could maybe put two again on them . "
B,Task,"And everything else has stayed pretty much the same comm so "
A,Task,"Well comm ease has certainly stayed . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"And what about the sort of innovation ? "
B,Task,"Um comm well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um "
D,Minor,"Do you think "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And the speech feature . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm the speech feature . "
D,Task,"And then comm the corporate identity . "
B,Task,"I think we've cut just about the same . "
B,Minor,"We've maybe lost "
B,Minor,"Hasn't it "
B,Task,"It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect "
A,Task,"How it would play out comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity comm I don't know . "
D,Task,"I mean comm it's maybe not . I mean "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics comm but "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But either way comm I think we've made it fairly close to what "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Okay comm well I mean "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I don't see how we could make it any more . "
C,Task,"Um comm apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue comm like the casing . "
D,Minor,"We cou "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"But then what colour would you make the R_s ? "
B,Task,"just the the company logo . "
B,Task,"So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off . "
A,Task,"Well comm but you've got the company logo on there comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"which would effectively be a stick-on badge . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So you're in a sense comm you're comparing the product without the company logo . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Hey comm what what what's the company colour ? "
D,Elicit,"Did you get told what the company colour is or "
B,Task,"I'm still not quite sure we've established that . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"I just "
A,Task,"Don't think so . "
C,Task,"We got the logo off the web browser . "
A,Task,"But but i but in the sense that comm as you saw with um the Windows logo badge comm it doesn't really matter . "
D,Minor,"Oh right . "
A,Minor,"There's virtually n "
A,Task,"The way that you frame comm you know comm the Windows badge on there comm it really doesn't matter what colour it is comm "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Fact comm they've got black and white or black and silver . "
A,Task,"So basically comm even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display comm because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo comm it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"'Cause you've got sort of "
D,Task,"we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to . "
A,Task,"You could put in another "
D,Task,"Another colour . "
D,Minor,"Or would that be t "
A,Task,"Well comm in this one comm you've actually got three colours of buttons . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well comm we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So you were talking about uh um "
A,Task,"We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel comm the hidden away panel comm would all be standard . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Which m may or may not be the case . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Shall we save the point two for profitability then ? "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Well comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know comm on the second page comm as it were comm that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ? "
C,Task,"Um comm I don't think they would really need to be . "
C,Task,"I think if they were just all small round blue buttons comm it'd be fine . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"maybe we've m "
C,Task,"Needs to be an enter button comm "
C,Task,"but could just be the same as well . "
B,Task,"Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time comm we make it look good comm and um comm fit the kind of idea of what they want . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"And then for the more functional buttons comm we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a "
B,Task,"plus it's hidden away anyway comm "
B,Task,"you're not gonna see it at the start . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I mean it's the sort of thing that comm I mean comm you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"well "
D,Task,"So comm if it's dead obvious comm then that's fine . "
D,Task,"But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning comm then you're paying a bit more attention . "
D,Task,"So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important . "
A,Task,"Alright . Okay . "
D,Minor,"'Cause you "
D,Elicit,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So we just add that to profitability in effect . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I mean so we've dropped the cost comm but "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Right comm so we're meant to finish up in five minutes . "
D,Other,"Same sort of function ? The criteria ? "
D,Task,"It's alright . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"Just made a load of money . "
C,Task,"Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion comm "
C,Task,"go to a three ? "
C,Task,"'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel . "
C,Task,"'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all . "
D,Task,"Well comm but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber comm we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons . "
C,Other,"Alright . "
D,Minor,"le lemon sh "
C,Elicit,"Did we decide what that was comm which button it was ? "
D,Minor,"I think "
D,Task,"well comm we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . "
C,Elicit,"On the volume ones ? "
C,Task,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm . "
D,Task,"Or something like that . Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's good . "
B,Other,"Definitely lemon shaped . "
D,Elicit,"Did did you have to have a rubber case comm though comm for rubber buttons ? "
D,Elicit,"Or was it the other way around ? "
B,Task,"You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . "
D,Task,"Right comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So I think we can we're okay . "
A,Elicit,"So we're okay this way around . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So that "
D,Minor,"so we've saved "
A,Other,"Until the design team comes in and says comm get off . "
A,Other,"But you are the design team . "
B,Other,"Then we say it's fine comm "
B,Other,"so it's all good . "
D,Task,"Saved two Euros on that . "
A,Elicit,"So what bit are we on to ? "
C,Elicit,"Um comm can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? "
C,Elicit,"Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ? "
C,Elicit,"And did we make it a cherry officially ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I th I th "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Oh . Right comm okay . "
B,Other,"Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like . "
A,Other,"Oh drats comm "
A,Task,"I've botched that comm haven't I . "
C,Elicit,"So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ? "
D,Task,"Well comm we're aiming for um one for all of them . "
D,Task,"M but it really has to fit into the budget comm "
C,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"so I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the "
D,Task,"Which is fair enough . "
B,Task,"And we seem to have least something in each criteria . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We haven't completely left anything out comm so "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"I think "
D,Minor,"most "
B,Task,"As an overall product which has to be quite cheap comm we've just about achieved everything . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
C,Elicit,"So do we have anything else to discuss ? "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Elicit,"What's on the agenda ? "
A,Minor,"Right comm okay um "
A,Elicit,"What's happened here ? "
A,Minor,"Right comm okay um "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Right comm okay um comm "
A,Minor,"Right . So we got "
B,Task,"We've got the closing . "
A,Task,"So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign . "
A,Task,"So we're now on to project process . "
A,Task,"Now satisfaction with comm for example comm room for creativity comm leadership comm teamwork comm means comm et cetera comm whiteboard comm digital pens comm et cetera . "
A,Task,"So comm we're actually now uh comm in a sense comm on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Minor,"So what did you "
A,Other,"and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain . "
A,Minor,"So comm um "
D,Other,"Finish your meeting now . "
B,Task,"We should just go through this quickly and then "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down comm "
A,Other,"which I will do . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"So comm uh I think I have to finish that page . "
D,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Right comm okay comm so "
A,Task,"Project evaluation . "
A,Minor,"So comm um "
A,Task,"Creativity . "
A,Elicit,"Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough ? "
B,Task,"Um comm yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well um "
D,Task,"I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary . "
A,Other,"Individual meetings . How do you mean ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Well comm we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings comm "
A,Task,"In you on your own . "
D,Task,"and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one comm you know comm "
D,Task,"sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where comm you know comm you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness comm but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons comm "
A,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . "
D,Task,"You know comm you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that . "
A,Minor,"Mm comm "
A,Task,"The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process comm you would normally comm you go to a meeting comm you decide comm right comm you do this comm you do that comm you do that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Then you go away . "
A,Task,"You find out information . "
A,Task,"You then come back . "
A,Task,"You then discuss it . "
A,Task,"You then go and change things around comm "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"and then go back . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time "
B,Task,"and then diff things will be relevant . "
A,Task,"Whereas comm this time comm you're really getting it from a database source comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"so it's not uh well uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Anyway comm so comm "
A,Elicit,"what do you want to put down ? "
A,Task,"I've put comm seemed okay . "
A,Task,"Creativity comm seemed okay . "
A,Task,"Um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . "
C,Task,"I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm the thing itself . "
A,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"I can't think of a better example at the minute . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Have could have used a different example pel to increase create Creativity . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Is this go "
B,Task,"It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about "
B,Task,"and then something we can at least look at "
B,Task,"and think how we can improve on . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing comm so "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control comm in a way . "
D,Task,"I mean it depends what sort of business you're in comm I guess . "
D,Task,"I mean this one seems . From the website it looks it's quite innovative comm "
D,Unlab,"but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we "
D,Task,"that's comm you know comm fifteen quid . "
B,Task,"one of those things . "
B,Task,"Like uh comm companies can have like a range of products and "
A,Minor,"I th I uh d "
B,Task,"I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of "
A,Task,"But the other thing is that uh they're I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . "
A,Task,"I mean comm m my wife at the moment comm for instance comm is uh acting as a computer "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"um for um "
A,Task,"you normally comm you got a problem comm so you go to your tutor "
A,Task,"and find out information to see how to get it fixed . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question . "
A,Minor,"And then you "
A,Task,"or the idea is that the whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction comm "
A,Minor,"show them where to "
A,Task,"either give them directly give them help comm "
A,Task,"or secondly comm point them in the right direction comm "
A,Task,"either at the library comm or uh or or come back comm or go and see Joe Bloggs comm or whatever . "
A,Task,"So uh comm and that was a project I suspect similar to this comm "
A,Task,"because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um to enable it to work . "
A,Task,"And of course comm you had the machine crashing "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and various things going wrong . So "
B,Task,"Well comm sh we look at the last slide comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"see if it's got anything else . "
B,Task,"I think there's one one more to go . "
A,Task,"Alright comm "
A,Minor,"so we've got uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I mean if you look at their products on their website here comm Real Reaction comm I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . "
A,Task,"New ideas found comm "
D,Minor,"And "
A,Elicit,"did we find any comm "
A,Task,"no . "
B,Task,"It was quite good with this um the white board comm having that and the digital pens . "
B,Task,"Like comm that's something that made it a little easier . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Leadership comm "
A,Elicit,"teamwork . "
D,Task,"we did find a new idea comm "
D,Task,"I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . "
D,Task,"I've never seen one of them before . "
D,Task,"batteries comm I think . So "
A,Minor,"Does "
B,Minor,"voice recognition comm especially not could "
D,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
A,Task,"You've got voice recognition computers comm "
A,Task,"that's not remote controls . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Well it's a different application of it . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so it's just like the same products comm but just put together in a different way . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"so how do you reckon teamwork went ? "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"That went okay comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"To uh go uh reasonably well . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything "
A,Task,"Bit bit arbitrary . "
D,Task,"Well comm I mean I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . "
D,Task,"I mean comm they've got all these sort of comm you know comm high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and uh I'm thinking comm do you know comm one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . "
D,Minor,"Surely they they should produ "
A,Task,"So comm we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means comm E_ G_ whiteboard comm digital pens comm et cetera . "
C,Task,"Well leadership's a bit of a funny one comm isn't it . "
A,Task,"And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership "
C,Task,"because you are the Project Manager . "
C,Task,"You were the leader . "
C,Task,"So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Now comm I'd much rather be in marketing "
A,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked . "
A,Minor,"However comm um "
A,Elicit,"Alright uh means comm so whiteboard um so really comm it's uh equipment . Oh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It worked . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm very nice . "
D,Task,"Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but "
C,Task,"But I mean comm I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these . "
C,Task,"I mean comm they record what you're writing comm "
C,Elicit,"and then what do you do with it ? "
C,Elicit,"Where do you get the recording ? "
C,Elicit,"Do you plug the computer or something ? "
D,Task,"I think there's a little there's a little um chi "
B,Task,"So it's not just for us comm "
B,Task,"it's for the experiment as a whole comm so "
D,Task,"There's a little there's a little chip comm "
D,Task,"I think you must plug it into something "
B,Task,"Should we quickly look at the last slide ? "
D,Task,"and it produces a "
B,Minor,"Sh "
C,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"I think you watch a video of it kind of . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something comm "
D,Other,"and Page after page . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"New ideas found comm so one or two . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Kinetic powered remote control . Um comm "
D,Elicit,"what was the other one ? "
C,Task,"Voice um recognition thing . "
D,Minor,"Vo yeah . "
A,Minor,"um and uh voice "
A,Elicit,"uh comm was it voice activated um "
D,Task,"Voice recognition comm yeah . S "
A,Other,"recognition . "
D,Task,"Almost . "
D,Task,"To fill in these fill in these questionnaires "
C,Task,"Pretty much . "
A,Minor,"Right comm so comm "
D,Minor,"Oh no . "
A,Elicit,"uh are the costs within budget comm "
A,Task,"yes . "
A,Elicit,"Is the project evaluated comm "
A,Task,"yes . "
A,Task,"Uh comm don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . "
A,Other,"Then celebration . "
B,Elicit,". Is that everything ? "
D,Other,"Hmm ? "
D,Task,"I think that we've got two questionnaires "
D,Task,"and a report on the last meeting . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm so we don't re "
A,Minor,"So really "
A,Task,"I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three comm "
