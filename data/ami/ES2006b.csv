Speaker,DialogAct,Text
C,Elicit,"All hooked up . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so "
C,Task,"now we are here at the functional design meeting . "
C,Task,"Um hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time "
C,Task,"'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . "
C,Task,"The agenda for the meeting comm I put it in the sh shared documents folder . "
C,Elicit,"I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not . "
C,Elicit,"Did anyone ? "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Other,"No . "
C,Other,"Oh well . "
C,Other,"Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well "
C,Task,"so if you check in there comm there's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"Um um wi on on a what ? "
D,Other,"Oh project project documents comm yeah comm yeah comm yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"Project documents comm yeah . "
C,Other,"So I'll put it in there . "
D,Other,"Oh okay comm yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Is it best if I send you an email maybe comm to let you know it's there ? "
D,Task,"Yes comm I think so . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
C,Other,"I'll do that next time . "
C,Other,"Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting "
C,Other,"and just take minutes as we go through comm "
C,Other,"and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . "
C,Task,"The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time comm "
C,Task,"so we'll go through each of you one by one . "
C,Task,"Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . "
C,Minor,"I just sent "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"the last minute comm yeah comm "
C,Task,"at the last minute comm "
D,Task,"yeah . "
C,Other,"I'm sorry about that comm "
C,Task,"but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Um and "
C,Task,"then we need to comm by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be "
C,Task,"and what the functions of the remote control "
C,Minor,"that's the "
C,Task,"the main goal is to come up with those two things comm target group and functions of the remote control . "
C,Task,"And we've got forty minutes to do that in . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"I would say "
A,Task,"You said uh targ target groups comm "
C,Elicit,"yeah ? "
A,Elicit,"what does that mean ? "
C,Task,"As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to comm "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Other,"Uh okay comm 'kay . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"So are "
C,Minor,"So we need to "
C,Task,"yeah comm we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . "
C,Task,"So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . "
C,Elicit,"Does anyone have a preference for going first ? "
A,Task,"Alright . "
A,Other,"I can go first comm "
C,Elicit,"You wanna go first ? "
D,Minor,"Okay . Hmm . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"so we need to unplug my laptop "
C,Task,"and plug in yours . "
C,Elicit,"I assume we just pull it out ? "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Right . Um "
A,Minor,"so f from the "
C,Task,"Just before you start comm to make it easier comm would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we "
C,Task,"you don't have to do it now but when once you go back comm "
D,Other,"Okay comm yeah comm afterwards comm yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"Right sure . "
C,Task,"just so that I don't have to scribble everything down . "
A,Minor,"Uh okay . "
A,Task,"So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote "
A,Task,"and uh se uh from the design comm functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are "
A,Task,"and how how they work together with each other . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role . "
A,Task,"Um the identification of the components comm "
A,Elicit,"uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects comm I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level "
A,Task,"and uh basically update and come up with a new design comm "
A,Task,"so it's a cyclical process . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"these were the basic findings from today . "
A,Task,"The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . "
A,Task,"Uh I just quickly jotted them down . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Minor,"basically uh the "
A,Task,"as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated comm "
A,Task,"so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"also uh the remote control should be used only for television comm "
A,Task,"because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . "
A,Task,"And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . "
A,Task,"How however comm our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television comm in order to keep things simple . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"also the management wants that um our design should be unique "
A,Minor,"uh it "
A,Task,"so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . "
A,Task,"The user interf interface communicates with the chip comm "
A,Other,"so I'll basic go over to the "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell comm uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip comm which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . "
A,Task,"There is a user interface here . "
A,Task,"So whe when the user presses a button comm it feeds into the chip "
A,Task,"and the chip then generates a response "
A,Task,"and takes the response to an infrared terminal comm "
A,Minor,"um which then "
A,Task,"so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code comm "
A,Task,"which is then communicated to the remote site comm "
A,Task,"which h has an infrared receiver . "
A,Task,"Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"so these are the essent "
A,Task,"so a all the functionality of the remote control comm "
A,Task,"whatever new functions that we need to do comm um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger comm basically . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Task,"i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . "
A,Task,"This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . "
A,Task,"And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design comm so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . "
A,Task,"That's about it . "
A,Elicit,"So anything that you would like to know or "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
C,Elicit,"Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? "
A,Task,"No comm I don't have any idea about what each component costs . "
C,Minor,"Br "
A,Minor,"Um yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"'Cause that's something to consider comm I guess comm "
C,Task,"if we're if we're using more advanced technology comm it might increase the price . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Certainly comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"So so tha "
A,Task,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"we definitely need to operate within our constraints comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but um unfortunately I I do not have any data comm "
A,Task,"so uh I just identified the functional components for that . "
C,Task,"That's fine . "
C,Elicit,"Are there any more questions comm "
C,Elicit,"or shall we just skip straight to the next one "
C,Task,"and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? "
D,Task,"I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think that will do . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Okay comm so do you want to "
D,Other,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Elicit,"shall shall we pull this up ? "
D,Task,"okay comm yeah . "
C,Task,"I think that has to come out of there . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I thought those last minute things comm they're gonna hit you the worst . "
D,Minor,"Oh i "
D,Minor,"Okay comm I hope "
D,Other,"wait . "
D,Elicit,"Should it just "
A,Task,"I it'll take some time . "
C,Task,"It ta takes a little "
D,Task,"There's just nothing . "
C,Minor,"Oh comm and have you "
C,Task,"you need to then also press on yours comm function F_ eight comm "
D,Other,"Oh right comm right comm right comm um "
C,Task,"so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Nothin "
D,Task,"okay comm something is coming up . "
A,Task,"Oh comm there it is comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Now it's coming comm "
A,Task,"It'll come up comm "
A,Minor,"it "
C,Task,"computer no signal . "
A,Task,"um uh no signal . "
D,Other,"No signal ? "
D,Elicit,"Why ? "
C,Task,"Maybe again ? "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah comm it says something now comm "
D,Task,"Oh . My my computer went blank now . "
A,Task,"adjusting "
C,Other,"Okay comm adjusting . "
D,Other,"Adjusting . "
D,Task,"But I don't see anything "
C,Task,"There we go comm there we go . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I don't see anything on my computer now . "
D,Task,"This is the problem comm but "
A,Task,"Oh comm that's strange . "
C,Task,"Oh comm if you press if you press function and that again "
C,Task,"there's there's usually three modes comm one where it's only here comm one where it's only there comm and one where it's both . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"And one more time . "
C,Task,"Okay comm so one more time . "
D,Minor,"Uh now it's "
D,Task,"okay . "
D,Other,"No ? No . "
C,Minor,"Should "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"yeah just wait for a moment comm "
C,Other,"adjusting . "
D,Task,"Oh okay . "
D,Task,"Okay comm that's fine comm that's good . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Okay comm let's start from the beginning . "
D,Task,"So I'm going to speak about technical functions design "
D,Task,"uh just like some some first issues that came up . "
D,Minor,"Um 'kay comm "
D,Task,"so the method I was um adopting at this point comm it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . "
C,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls comm "
D,Task,"uh so mostly just by searching on the web "
D,Task,"and to see what um functionality they used . "
D,Task,"And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . "
D,Task,"And yeah comm and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set comm "
D,Task,"so this quite straightforward . "
D,Task,"And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on comm switching off comm "
D,Task,"uh then the user would like to switch the channel "
D,Task,"um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels comm "
D,Task,"or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel comm "
D,Task,"so we would need the numbers . "
D,Task,"And and also the volume is very important . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"um I als "
A,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Elicit,"cou could you go back for a second ? "
D,Other,"okay . "
A,Other,"Uh switching on off channel comm uh volume comm "
A,Task,"okay comm that's great . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design comm like operating a V_C_R_ comm "
D,Task,"but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players comm "
D,Task,"but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them comm "
D,Task,"but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . "
D,Task,"And then it must be easy to use comm "
D,Task,"so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button "
D,Task,"and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . "
D,Minor,"Um then "
D,Task,"yeah comm the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers "
D,Task,"and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel comm "
D,Task,"and then volume has to be there . "
D,Task,"But then um other functionalities um could be just "
D,Task,"uh there could be a menu button "
D,Task,"and you could change things on the screen then comm "
D,Task,"um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu . "
D,Minor,"And yeah comm "
D,Task,"the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities comm "
D,Task,"the answer was already no because of the last minute update . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So at the for the time being that's uh that's all . "
D,Elicit,"If you have questions "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"If "
C,Task,"I mean that was the the directive that came through from management comm "
C,Other,"but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ comm I could get back to them and see . "
C,Elicit,"It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included "
D,Task,"because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever comm "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? "
A,Task,"So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . "
A,Minor,"Um but um "
A,Elicit,"so so at this stage comm uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify "
A,Task,"or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons "
A,Task,"and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . "
A,Elicit,"But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ? "
D,Task,"Um well comm I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use comm "
D,Elicit,"I mean um what other options would you have ? "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"A little screen or something comm "
D,Task,"but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and it'll make the costs "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly comm "
D,Task,"not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons comm "
D,Elicit,"but if if you have other mm proposals um . "
A,Task,"Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh i if the if the costs allow comm we can have like an L_C_D_ display "
A,Minor,"and uh with um "
A,Task,"because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So yeah ? Cool . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Sure comm "
C,Task,"we can discuss that maybe after the next one . "
B,Task,"Cool . "
C,Elicit,"Do you want to "
B,Task,"Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ? "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Other,"Uh am I going in the right direction ? "
D,Other,"No . "
D,Other,"Wait . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay comm here it comes . "
C,Other,"Oh comm I'm getting hungry . "
D,Task,"Okay comm here you are . "
B,Task,"Cool . "
B,Other,"Ah comm "
B,Other,"that's why it won't meet . "
B,Task,"Okay comm cool . "
C,Elicit,"You set ? "
B,Task,"Yep comm cool . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"functional requirements . "
C,Task,"Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here . "
B,Task,"Alright comm yeah . "
C,Other,"Hello . "
A,Minor,"try to press "
C,Minor,"Is it plugged in prop "
B,Task,"It's working . "
A,Task,"oh comm okay comm "
C,Elicit,"it's working ? "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"yep . "
C,Other,"Excellent . "
B,Minor,"Cool comm okay . "
B,Task,"So what I have comm wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects "
B,Task,"and then they gave them a questionnaire . "
B,Task,"Um so it was all about comm you know comm how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control comm you know . "
B,Task,"What's the most annoying things about remote controls "
B,Task,"and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . "
B,Task,"Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens comm "
B,Task,"so I should have taken that bit out comm "
B,Other,"but anyway . "
B,Minor,"Um okay comm so . "
B,Task,"What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are comm "
B,Task,"so you know comm definitely you should be looking at something quite different . "
B,Task,"Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . "
B,Other,"Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . "
B,Task,"Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know comm a nice looking remote control . "
B,Task,"Um current remote controls comm they don't match the user behaviour well comm "
B,Task,"as you'll see on the next slide . "
B,Task,"Um I dunno what zapping is comm "
B,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"It's um switching between channels comm sort of randomly going through . "
B,Other,"Oh comm right . "
B,Task,"But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . "
B,Task,"Um okay comm fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"so that's going back to what comm you know comm we were saying earlier about comm you know comm do you need all the buttons on the remote control comm "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"they just make it look ugly . "
B,Minor,"Okay ? Cool . "
B,Task,"Um so this is my little graph thing . "
C,Task,"Ooh comm that's a bit difficult to see . "
B,Minor,"Mm k "
C,Task,"If you explain it to us it'll be fine . "
B,Other,"Okay comm well comm I can send it to all of you . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"What it is is um it's cones comm "
B,Task,"'cause I thought they'd be more exciting . "
B,Minor,"Um but "
C,Minor,"I liked the comm I liked the litt "
B,Other,"ooh where's it go ? "
C,Other,"ooh come back . "
B,Other,"Back . "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"Oh yes comm cool . "
B,Other,"Okay comm I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Um okay comm so like "
B,Task,"what it shows is how much things are used relatively "
B,Task,"and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"What you can't see is volume selection comm it's a little bit higher than all the others . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm comm "
C,Elicit,"that's the next one along comm yeah ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"so what the graph shows is that comm you know comm power comm channel selection and volume selection are important comm "
B,Task,"and the rest of them comm you know comm nobody really uses "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance comm you know comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"so on a scale of one to ten comm how important is that "
B,Task,"and comm you know comm channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential comm "
B,Task,"and the power comm well it's not quite so essential comm apparently comm "
B,Task,"although I don't understand how it couldn't be comm "
B,Task,"um and everything else comm I think comm you know comm you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control comm "
B,Task,"'cause they're just not needed comm "
B,Task,"and they're not used . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"This is the bit that the email messed up for me "
B,Task,"and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm cool . "
B,Minor,"So um okay comm "
B,Task,"so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . "
B,Task,"Uh that they get lost comm "
B,Task,"that the uh you know comm they're not intuitive "
B,Task,"and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know comm watching T_V_ comm then that's the least of your problems comm "
C,Task,"The remote control . "
B,Task,"but you know comm it's up there . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Um that yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that comm like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control "
B,Task,"and you know comm not straining your wrists watching T_V_ . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yes . Okay comm cool . Right comm um "
B,Other,"sorry "
B,Task,"this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table comm "
B,Task,"and I didn't have time to white it out again . "
C,Task,"That's alright . "
B,Minor,"Um okay comm "
B,Task,"but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . "
B,Task,"So you can see from that that comm you know comm younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software comm "
B,Task,"whereas as people get older comm they're a bit more sceptical about it "
B,Task,"and they're less willing to to try it . "
B,Task,"Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about comm "
B,Task,"but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ comm you know comm tends to be people talking "
C,Unlab,"Mm . "
B,Task,"and um comm you know comm how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Elicit,"Um okay ? "
B,Minor,"Cool . Um okay comm "
B,Task,"so these are my personal preferences . "
B,Task,"So you have sleek comm stylish comm sophisticated comm you know comm "
B,Task,"so something that's comm you know comm a bit cool . "
B,Task,"Um you know comm functional comm so it's useful comm but minimalist . "
B,Task,"Um there's a there's an important thing that comm you know comm people use when comm you know comm when you're filling up your home comm you know comm a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap comm basically comm you know comm "
B,Task,"and you've got all this stuff comm and you're just like comm what the hell is that comm who is ever gonna use it ? You know comm "
B,Task,"so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both comm "
B,Task,"so I think we need to aim for both . "
A,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
B,Task,"Um okay comm then a long battery life comm like you were talking about earlier "
B,Task,"and um comm you know comm I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool "
B,Task,"because comm you know comm your remote control just sits there comm "
B,Task,"and you could just sit it in the sunshine "
B,Task,"and save the environment a bit . "
B,Task,"Um and then like a locator comm "
B,Task,"so you know comm kind of like you have for a mobile phone or "
B,Task,"not a mobile phone "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Some kind of a ring comm "
C,Task,"Keys and things like that comm "
A,Minor,"some "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's it comm you know . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Whistle and it screams at you comm yeah . "
B,Task,"I know comm it's weird . "
B,Task,"My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning "
B,Task,"and I was like I need to get one for everything . "
B,Task,"So yeah comm so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps comm "
B,Minor,"something "
B,Task,"a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ comm you know comm "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes comm "
B,Task,"'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . "
B,Elicit,"So okay ? "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Other,"Cool . "
B,Task,"That's me . "
C,Task,"That's you comm excellent . "
A,Task,"Okay comm that's great comm "
D,Task,"Um that's very good comm "
A,Other,"thanks . "
D,Task,"very interesting . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
C,Other,"I'm just gonna tick yes . "
C,Task,"So comm we've got about ten comm fifteen minutes to discuss "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . "
B,Task,"Cat's . Ca . "
A,Task,"So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned comm if we want to have something sleek and uh you know comm good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know comm people who are comparatively elderly . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey comm you know comm whether comm you know comm these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control comm "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"but I'm assuming comm you know comm yes . "
A,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"so if you want to put in something stylish comm then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket "
A,Task,"Right comm "
C,Task,"and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions . "
A,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"Well comm that's when you go to uni comm isn't it ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Other,"So comm you know "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but you don't have much money comm generally . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five comm when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and "
D,Task,"you share a television or something that yeah . "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But uh still comm if if you can go back to that slide "
A,Elicit,"and uh comm how popular was it ? "
C,Minor,"O oh it's on "
B,Task,"Oh comm I've unplugged it . "
C,Other,"sorry comm "
C,Task,"we unplugged it . "
B,Other,"Do you want me to "
A,Other,"Oh comm oh comm okay . "
C,Other,"Here comm let me "
A,Other,"That's alright comm "
A,Task,"if you can just look it up on your computer comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five comm uh how popular was "
B,Task,"Seventy six point three percent . "
D,Task,"It was seventy something comm yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"So even they are seventy six percent comm is that high amount ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income "
B,Task,"because they don't have like I mean comm you know comm if you're at university comm you're paying your rent comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"they've got no commitments and "
B,Task,"but you don't have a mortgage comm "
B,Task,"you don't have a life insurance policy comm "
A,Task,"Alright . "
C,Task,"usually not a car and all of those things . "
B,Task,"you don't normally have a car comm "
B,Task,"yeah comm so . "
C,Task,"Kids . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You're still learning to drive actually comm "
A,Minor,"So you're more likely to b "
B,Task,"so that just costs more than a car comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"but yeah . Um so "
B,Task,"I mean like it is an age group to target comm really comm I think . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price comm that's not unaffordable comm even for young people . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Elicit,"I mean that's what comm that's like fifteen Pounds ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"You know comm I think "
D,Task,"Yeah this this is not unaffordable comm "
D,Task,"but the problem is whether people need it comm whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I d I don't know many people without a T_V_ . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"But do they "
B,Task,"We didn't have a T_V_ last year comm "
B,Task,"and everyone thought we were off our heads comm you know . "
C,Task,"But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah "
D,Task,"Common comm "
D,Minor,"the students "
D,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"The s the stu "
C,Task,"and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote . "
D,Minor,"yeah comm and the remote control might not "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"it might not even function with the old T_V_ . "
A,Minor,"Mm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular comm right ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"we're still "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"So mm uh are are are "
D,Minor,"Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think I think the fact that comm you know comm ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes comm I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control comm does say quite a lot really . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"You know comm so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore comm you know . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"because actually I mean they're all still re young people . "
B,Task,"Is not a massive difference comm you know . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five comm "
B,Task,"No comm do totally . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features comm "
A,Task,"but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about comm "
A,Task,"because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Uh and uh "
B,Task,"You do have it in your mobile phone though comm don't you ? "
B,Minor,"Because you have like "
B,Task,"I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But how frequently do we use it anyway "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"and um uh h ho how good is it comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five comm "
D,Minor,"An "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"louder comm "
B,Minor,"S so "
C,Task,"tha that should be relatively simple . "
A,Task,"Right . Okay . "
B,Task,"y you'd maybe need a code word . "
A,Minor,"O "
B,Elicit,"Do you know what I mean ? "
A,Other,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"So like when you say change comm except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ comm "
B,Task,"so maybe like comm you know comm remote . "
B,Task,"I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Other,"Although I only watch Charmed comm so really I wouldn't know "
B,Task,"but like so you'd just say remote five comm you know comm remote ten comm remote one two nine . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check . "
A,Other,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Um comm so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group "
D,Minor,"Yeah but uh um "
C,Task,"and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah sure comm yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons comm "
D,Task,"but I think this is not really the right moment yet comm "
D,Task,"because people are just so used to buttons "
D,Task,"and um comm yeah it's it's kind of safer comm so we we need both comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I think we need both . "
A,Minor,"Mm . W "
A,Minor,"What uh "
D,Task,"so the voice recognition would be just an extra comm "
D,Task,"it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . "
A,Task,"If we can do with away with that comm our product can be really popular "
A,Task,"uh in the sense that uh a person can say comm I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm so if uh if something like that can be incorporated comm "
B,Task,"that would be another way to do it . "
C,Task,"So that if that was in the the voice recognition comm that would be great . "
A,Minor,"some kind of "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but then the code word would be even more important comm "
B,Task,"because I mean Sky advertise on every channel comm don't they comm you know comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed comm and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . "
C,Other,"Watch Sky "
C,Minor,"and yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
B,Task,"and that would be really annoying . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm that's "
A,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But that's definitely a possibility . "
D,Task,"Yeah but m but on the other hand comm remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"and and the T_V_ would be already further away comm so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? "
C,Task,"So that you can yell at it comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you know comm so you have to have the remote control . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime comm you can yell at it and it'll just change it comm you can look for it later comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Alright . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm but then the remote control I think I mean "
D,Task,"um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television comm "
D,Task,"because then you could already yell at the television "
D,Task,"and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control comm "
D,Task,"so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
B,Task,"I suppose nearer to you "
B,Task,"but a b like if you have surround sound then "
A,Minor,"Mm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"being cl I mean it'll it'll mm . "
D,Task,"No comm but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us comm a and uh not to yell at it from the distance . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ comm "
A,Task,"so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control comm wherever it is comm it'll beep comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"so we we can probably come to know where it is . "
C,Minor,"That's "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"but then if you're buying the remote separately comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but y you could have something comm but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something comm "
D,Other,"Oh yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Right comm yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay comm yeah comm mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack comm so one part attaches to the T_V_ . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . "
C,Minor,"The l "
C,Task,"Well that's right comm "
A,Minor,"Alright comm yeah . "
C,Task,"but it solves the problem of having different noises . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm definitely comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Okay comm "
C,Task,"I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . "
C,Task,"But if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds comm we want it to look simple comm but still have the buttons so it's easy to use comm but only those key buttons comm the major buttons and then one sort of menu one comm and then voice recognition included as an option "
D,Other,"The major ones comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"What we have to do now is to go back to our little places comm "
C,Task,"complete our questionnaire "
C,Task,"and some sort of summarisation comm "
C,Task,"which y you'll get immediately by email . "
C,Task,"Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes comm "
C,Task,"and then we've got a lunch break "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . "
C,Other,"Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder comm "
C,Other,"but I'll send you an email when I do it comm so that you know . "
A,Elicit,"So where exactly is this i "
C,Task,"It should be on your desktop comm "
C,Task,"so on the "
A,Other,"Ah comm okay . "
C,Other,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . "
D,Task,"Did you find it ? "
D,Minor,"It's just "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah in that one comm "
D,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"right yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm and email them round . "
B,Elicit,"Oh comm so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there comm hey ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"that would be great . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Oh so so we'll just put them i there comm "
C,Task,"Oh yeah comm put them in there . Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"we we yeah comm w we won't even okay . "
B,Task,"There you go . "
C,Task,"then you don't have to email them . "
B,Elicit,"But is everyone's called functional requirements ? "
C,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"they're all called something slightly different . "
C,Task,"Technical requirements and something something comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so that's good . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's me done . "
C,Task,"So comm if you put them in there comm we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . "
B,Task,"Okay comm cool . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"as to where we're going from here comm you're going to look at the components concept . "
A,Other,"Right . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Other,"Whatever that means . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I guess I'll find out . "
C,Task,"You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept comm "
D,Task,"Uh something conceptual comm yeah . "
C,Task,"on something conceptual "
C,Task,"and you're watching trends to see how we go "
C,Task,"and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that "
C,Task,"um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ? "
A,Elicit,"Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? "
A,Task,"Con components comm oh . "
C,Task,"Components comm "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
D,Other,"Sorry comm "
D,Elicit,"but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Elicit,"or shall we prepare our "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"we have we have "
C,Task,"after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare comm "
D,Task,"To prepare comm "
D,Task,"okay comm yeah comm that's good . "
C,Task,"so that's fine comm "
C,Task,"w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Okay ? "
C,Task,"Right on time . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"so you can "
C,Task,"I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? "
D,Other,"Okay comm see you . "
