A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"welcome everyone to our next meeting . "
A,Task,"I'm busy writing "
A,Task,"and busy leading the meeting comm "
A,Task,"but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda "
A,Task,"I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . "
A,Task,"Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting comm which is hereby opened . "
A,Task,"Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes "
A,Task,"which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder comm "
A,Task,"which was quite some typing . "
A,Task,"Um today we once again have uh three presentations comm if I'm right comm "
A,Task,"and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . "
A,Task,"And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
A,Task,"I'd say let's start with the first presentation . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"Um in the same order as last time ? "
C,Minor,"W "
C,Task,"sure . "
B,Task,"Mm . Alright . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"take it away . "
C,Minor,"Okay "
C,Other,"uh welcome you all . "
C,Other,"Components design comm "
C,Other,"um uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh elaborate some of the things I did . "
C,Task,"I I elaborated on the concept . "
C,Task,"What should be um "
C,Task,"uh said about uh the components comm uh its properties "
C,Task,"and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . "
C,Minor,"Uh well "
C,Task,"first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed . "
C,Other,"Uh first of all comm the case comm the case comm the surrounding of the of the the remote control . "
C,Other,"I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about . "
D,Task,"Don't destroy my giraffe . "
C,Task,"Giraffe's gone now . "
C,Minor,"Okay um "
C,Task,"the case was is made from rubber comm I suppose . "
C,Task,"There's one of the "
C,Task,"because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control "
D,Task,"Drop it . "
C,Task,"and they break uh "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"becau "
C,Task,"the uh titanium was also an option . "
C,Task,"But uh it's a very expensive material . "
C,Task,"Uh rubber is comm I think comm uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh "
C,Task,"for our remote control . "
C,Task,"Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . "
C,Task,"Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour . "
C,Task,"Uh titanium uh you have to paint it "
C,Task,"and with that uh it's possible to scratch it "
C,Task,"or uh yeah make it ugly . "
C,Task,"Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour comm "
C,Task,"so if you scratch it it's still the same colour comm "
C,Task,"perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . "
C,Task,"But it's a very strong material . "
C,Task,"Um I h I had an idea single covered uh curved comm sorry comm single curved . "
C,Minor,"Uh so "
C,Task,"it's t two dimensional . "
C,Other,"I think it's uh it's best to draw "
C,Other,"oh "
C,Task,"green . "
B,Task,"It's a colour . "
D,Other,"Bright colour . Fancy colour . Forward . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Other,"New . Blank . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"You have to go t "
C,Other,"Let's make it uh black . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I thought of an idea like this . "
C,Other,"Oh that . "
C,Other,"Um delete . "
C,Other,"Blank . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So it also looks nice when it's on your table . "
C,Minor,"So you get "
C,Task,"uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table comm "
C,Task,"but it's c it's stands . "
D,Other,"Oh "
D,Task,"it's a side view . "
C,Task,"Side view yes it's side view "
C,Minor,"so uh "
C,Other,"I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling comm "
C,Minor,"but . "
C,Task,"Um uh it's just an idea I had "
C,Minor,"so it's uh it's very uh "
C,Task,"so its also looks nice when it's on the table . "
C,Task,"Um the graphical user interface and the buttons comm uh we also thought about that already . "
C,Task,"Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen comm "
C,Task,"which is uh is easy to clean too . "
C,Task,"One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff . "
C,Task,"And um it should be made of strong plastic "
C,Task,"and it should be bright . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material "
C,Minor,"and I think "
C,Minor,"uh well "
C,Task,"we also we almost concluded about that "
C,Task,"uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . "
D,Task,"True . "
C,Minor,"So uh "
C,Task,"uh that's all about uh the buttons . "
C,Task,"Uh the batteries comm uh we also thought about that already comm "
C,Task,"uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station "
C,Task,"so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station "
C,Task,"so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . "
C,Elicit,"Questions comm ? "
D,Task,"No no no no no . "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"Just looking . "
C,Task,"And they should be long lasting comm not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . "
C,Task,"And next step is the chip "
C,Task,"uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . "
C,Task,"Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip "
C,Task,"but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements comm there should be an advanced chip in it "
C,Task,"with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition "
C,Task,"uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase comm "
C,Minor,"so uh "
C,Task,"there should be some more uh investigation on that side . "
C,Other,"Uh my personal preferences uh "
C,Task,"I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . "
C,Elicit,"That was correct comm wasn't it ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image comm "
A,Task,"so yeah comm it needs colour comm "
C,Minor,"Okay "
C,Task,"they should be m sh they should be in mind comm "
C,Elicit,"wasn't it ? "
A,Task,"but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . "
C,Other,"Okay "
C,Elicit,"so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan ? "
A,Task,"It must be recognisable . "
C,Other,"Okay okay . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"that's possible of course . "
C,Task,"We could make a little R_ and R_ on the top of the machine . "
B,Task,"You can put the R_ and R_ . "
C,Minor,"Uh so "
C,Task,"they are pretty boring comm "
C,Task,"I suggest comm because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours comm so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls "
C,Minor,"which peopl uh who people "
C,Minor,"in "
C,Task,"which people will find they're uh interesting . "
C,Task,"And uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . "
C,Task,"Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely "
C,Minor,"imp instead of uh "
C,Task,"of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that comm "
C,Task,"but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic comm hard plastic or uh titanium . "
C,Task,"And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control comm "
C,Task,"because it yeah it makes sense . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Well "
C,Task,"that's all about my uh my findings . "
B,Other,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"thank you . "
D,Task,"Mm mm mm . Next . "
B,Other,"I will go next . "
B,Minor,"Alright so "
B,Task,"I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look . "
B,Task,"And uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons comm but only an L_C_D_ screen comm "
B,Task,"so I had to uh look on that . "
B,Task,"And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . "
B,Other,"Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . "
B,Task,"And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device "
B,Task,"and it answers you . "
B,Task,"And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . "
B,Task,"And so that it you say uh good morning comm uh coffee maker comm and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that "
B,Task,"uh you say record into the device into the speaker "
B,Task,"and then you say the question "
B,Task,"and three seconds later you say the answer "
B,Task,"and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Um perhaps it's useful comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"perhaps for because people um lose the remote comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something . "
D,Task,"It's true . "
B,Task,"And perhaps we could uh implement that . "
B,Other,"And then I have to go out of the presentation "
B,Task,"because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like "
C,Other,"Oh my God . "
B,Other,"but I can't draw comm "
B,Minor,"so uh "
B,Task,"don't make too much of it . "
B,Task,"I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw . "
B,Task,"I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . "
B,Elicit,"I don't know if there is an icon for the program comm "
B,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"Not just a P_ . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"P_ "
D,Task,"yeah comm just a P_ . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
C,Minor,".. . "
B,Task,"and then the buttons above and uh below "
B,Task,"the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
D,Elicit,"Where's where's the button for two ? "
B,Task,"I forgot that one . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I thought I forgot something comm "
B,Minor,"but uh . "
B,Task,"And uh and uh the numbers comm "
B,Task,"that should be a bit larger "
B,Task,"I think it's not really on scale and and so forth . "
C,Other,"Ah . "
D,Other,"Doesn't matter . "
B,Task,"Um an options button . "
B,Task,"And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart "
B,Task,"because it's not really options comm I think . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing . "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"So could call it settings or something . "
B,Task,"But this is a bit uh how I thought it . "
B,Task,"And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote . "
B,Task,"Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should comm "
B,Task,"so that it's better in your hand or something uh . "
C,Other,"Oh okay comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that . "
B,Task,"Uh and then uh if you press the op options button comm now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do "
B,Task,"and that you could do with something like this this . "
C,Other,"Oh yeah comm . "
B,Task,"And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . "
B,Task,"And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . "
B,Task,"So they want to u use one button and then something happens comm "
B,Task,"and not choose with uh this kind of uh "
B,Task,"And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"That's an option . "
B,Task,"And that was my uh finding "
B,Minor,"dinge . "
A,Other,"Thanks . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Now our third "
C,Other,"Go Danny comm go Danny . "
A,Task,"team member with his presentation . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Other,"I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years comm what the people like comm what the youngsters like comm what the elderly people liked about shapes comm colours comm material and stuff . "
D,Other,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"The method I used was "
D,Task,"Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours comm shapes comm material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . "
D,Task,"So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . "
D,Other,"Findings I made . "
D,Task,"The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . "
D,Task,"The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative comm "
D,Minor,"okay comm "
D,Task,"like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative "
D,Task,"so that should be great meeting for this . "
D,Task,"And the third thing is it should be easy to use . "
D,Task,"I think with only one menu comm four button comm channel comm volume comm it should also be enough for easy to use . "
D,Task,"The personal preferences for the young people comm they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow comm uh strawberry red and stuff . "
C,Other,"Fruity ? "
C,Minor,"Fruity . "
B,Elicit,"Grass green . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Like that . "
D,Task,"The round shapes comm and soft material m materials like the rubber . "
C,Minor,"Mm . Okay . "
D,Task,"It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . "
B,Other,"Let's build it into a sponge . "
D,Minor,"Th "
D,Task,"Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown comm red comm deep reds and stuff . "
D,Task,"They liked square shapes with round edges . "
D,Task,"And hard materials like wood comm um titanium . "
D,Minor,"They "
D,Task,"those kind of materials they liked . "
D,Task,"This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours comm innovative comm all the colours you see comm the blue comm the red comm the white comm the yellow comm that stuff . "
D,Task,"And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like "
A,Other,"Oh "
A,Minor,"y "
D,Task,"this or something . "
D,Task,"It's it's a bit like a banana . "
D,Task,"And the colour should be yellow comm or something . "
D,Task,"And for the elderly people just plain old . "
D,Task,"Because we decided to have two kind of remotes comm two designs comm "
D,Elicit,"or was it two colours ? "
B,Task,"It was one remote comm I think comm "
D,Other,"Different colours comm yeah . "
B,Task,"different colours . "
D,Task,"We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . "
D,Task,"I think like my colleague comm you said comm is that's e better comm or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something comm with round squares . "
D,Task,"Simple but "
D,Task,"easy to use . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So that's it . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So for the older people comm a more traditional uh form . "
D,Minor,"That is my "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"like the older o older colours I can maybe "
B,Task,"You could you could uh change the colours comm that was also the idea . "
B,Task,"I don't know which shape you should should take comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"but . "
D,Other,"Colours th the elderly people "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ? "
A,Task,"the shape of it . "
B,Task,"Perhaps you could find something in the middle . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Round but square . "
C,Minor,"s "
C,Task,"round corners comm but s but square comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But maybe then both groups won't buy it . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh i i if you do it uh uh square comm with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh "
B,Minor,"i "
B,Elicit,"Do you know what I mean ? "
C,Other,"Yeah I know what you mean comm "
C,Minor,"kind of like a . "
B,Task,"wait comm "
B,Task,"like like this uh a bit . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So it's a bit square comm but it's also a bit uh round . "
C,Task,"Kinda like a beer glass . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"but then "
C,Other,"I know what you mean . "
B,Task,"Same sides . "
C,Task,"It's also easy to to have to to put in your hand . "
B,Minor,"But that's uh "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"but that's also how other remotes are shaped comm "
B,Minor,"so that's uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But perhaps that's a good thing comm "
B,Task,"so that's easy to use . "
B,Task,"People know the "
C,Task,"Will recognise that's as a remote control . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh Look something like that . Autumn colours like red comm brown . "
C,Minor,"Uh when I saw your d "
C,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"They liked the wood a lot . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"kinda like old cars comm uh "
D,Task,"And a bit bit old school style renaissance comm medieval kind of things . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Swords . "
C,Task,"Let's put it all together . "
D,Minor,"Those kind of "
D,Task,"Yeah comm those kind of things . "
D,Elicit,"So you see the big difference "
D,Task,"between the young people ? Fresh comm exciting . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And the old people comm old and boring . "
B,Task,"But that's easily to do with the colour comm I think . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Other,"Sorry ? "
B,Task,"That's easy to do with the colours comm I think . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"I think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Because otherwise we have to get different shapes comm "
A,Task,"Yeah we think so too . "
D,Task,"and colour way easier than yeah the shapes . "
D,Minor,"In material yeah rubber comm rubber is comm "
D,Task,"like I said comm young people like more soft materials and spongy ones "
D,Task,"and the old people like plain wood . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So we have to decide if we're going to use "
D,Elicit,"real hard rubber comm or soft rubber . Or something something between that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"think uh "
C,Other,"Soft rubber . "
B,Task,"Also in between . "
D,Task,"Yeah soft rubber "
D,Task,"which you can you can feel in it . "
C,Other,"Yeah I know what you Um . "
B,Task,"I don't think you should be able to mould it comm "
D,Minor,"Or "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"No . "
D,Minor,"Or or wh "
C,Minor,"It should shouldn't be . "
D,Elicit,"what's something harder . "
D,Minor,"No no no "
D,Minor,"but but you have to "
D,Task,"like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"or something harder . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Elicit,"Bit like this kind of rubber . "
B,Minor,"This uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm something like this comm yeah . "
B,Task,"But it's quite hard comm this . "
D,Task,"Yeah it's quite hard "
D,Task,"but you can press it in . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It's feels kind s spongy . "
C,Minor,"Spongy . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Something . "
B,Task,"I don't think it's rubber . "
D,Task,"No . "
D,Minor,"N n n "
A,Task,"So we need a spongy feeling . "
B,Minor,"Uh did you have something about uh "
D,Other,"Are you going to invite Sponge Bob comm maybe he can "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So we should first decide about shape comm I think . "
C,Other,"Ding ding . "
D,Task,"Yeah I think that's the better thing to do . "
B,Minor,"Which uh "
B,Task,"Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it comm "
B,Task,"and can decide uh . "
C,Task,"Um I also s uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control "
C,Task,"and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit "
C,Minor,".. . "
C,Task,"This was your size comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but I think it should be larger . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"three quarter of the of the "
C,Task,"Yeah comm three quarters . "
C,Minor,"So uh so you don't have to put your oh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"the buttons won't get that small when the L_C_D_ screen is "
C,Other,"Uh new comm blank . "
C,Minor,"So uh "
C,Minor,"when you get this uh "
B,Task,"Ooh "
C,Elicit,"Uh kinda like this . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"Or should it be larger ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Larger I think . "
C,Elicit,"Larger ? "
C,Task,"Because you want to put your hands "
B,Minor,"But if you pu "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"becau because you have "
B,Task,"Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen . "
C,Minor,"You want "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Perhaps that's best . "
D,Task,"Yeah okay comm true comm true comm true true . "
C,Task,"Your thumb here . "
B,Minor,"But not on the screen because "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"that's uh that's an idea . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . "
C,Minor,"Because when you put your f "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself comm uh you'll you'll always get some "
C,Minor,"You "
B,Task,"You always touch it comm "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Going to be very greasy and stuff . "
D,Task,"But it won't get that small "
D,Task,"because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"One to zero comm the two digit comm "
C,Other,"Yeah you don't want it too small . "
C,Elicit,"How yeah how large "
D,Minor,"You have to you have to "
D,Task,"Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . "
C,Task,"Yeah they have thick fingers . "
C,Minor,"But if you wanna make it in international comm "
C,Task,"Japanese uh people got uh rather small hands "
D,Task,"Yeah true comm "
D,Minor,"but "
C,Minor,"and we got these large "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"we have we have the zoom option comm "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Other,"Zoom opt Ah yeah of course comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And we won't include a a pen comm or something to point comm "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"hey comm "
A,Task,"we we want to do it with our fingers comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"Your fingers comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"You don't want uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Y you could include a pen "
C,Task,"Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use "
D,Minor,"Use a pen You you c "
D,Task,"you can lose the pen . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers "
D,Task,"Yeah the fingers comm yeah . "
A,Task,"because th they're used to that "
B,Other,"Yeah o yeah comm if they think it's handy to use a pen . "
A,Minor,"and "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"I think this uh this is a good size for the screen . "
B,Elicit,"I don't know how how large the actual remote should be "
B,Task,"but a little bit like this comm or something . "
A,Task,"And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers comm huh . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"but that that can be with plain soft tissue . "
C,Task,"You can do whatever uh any uh cloth . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"you can buy those at "
A,Minor,"Okay well "
A,Elicit,"maybe comm if I can interrupt you comm "
A,Other,"maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision . "
C,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"So we can discuss these points . "
A,Task,"those points um energy question mark . "
A,Elicit,"How how should we uh supply the thing with energy "
A,Minor,"and how "
A,Elicit,"are we going to do it with separate docking station "
A,Elicit,"and then put in it . "
A,Task,"Uh chip on print and case . "
A,Task,"Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here comm "
A,Elicit,"but I hope you have ideas about them . "
B,Task,"I think energy were batteries "
B,Minor,"and then uh and uh "
C,Task,"The docking station . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So that's the the the first point . "
D,Task,"Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries "
A,Task,"We already decided that on the previous meeting . "
C,Minor,"W "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"which you can recharge through the docking station . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"if the badg the batteries are dead "
B,Task,"Just like with the telephone . "
C,Minor,"I kinda like your "
D,Task,"then you can re you can uh change them . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Elicit,"you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ? Mouse . Computer mouse . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah "
D,Task,"like those . "
C,Task,"Kinda like those kind of batteries . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"but it should be th I think normal batteries comm "
B,Minor,"not not like two or two uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm normal plain "
D,Minor,"you "
D,Minor,"No "
D,Task,"normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Simple rechargeable uh batteries . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Um what was with the chip on print ? "
C,Other,"The chip on print ? Um "
C,Minor,"Uh you gotta f "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"I think so . "
C,Minor,"Chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a "
D,Task,"Print plate . "
C,Task,"We also discussed that . "
C,Elicit,"Didn't we ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Elicit,"but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ? "
A,Task,"You still have a print plate . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"You always have a print plate . "
C,Other,"Beg your pardon ? "
D,Task,"You always have a print plate comm "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah sure comm of course comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Always comm "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Elicit,"I dunno what w what we have to decide about that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah well "
A,Task,"it's a good question . "
A,Task,"It just was in there "
A,Task,"and I didn't have any information about it comm "
C,Minor,"Well uh "
C,Task,"chip on print comm I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got comm uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button . "
A,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But when you got a L_C_D_ screen comm with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"for example if you enlarge a button comm or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen comm uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"When you got a regular button comm th the button of stand-by is always on the same place "
D,Task,"Yeah okay comm "
D,Task,"but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate comm "
C,Minor,"and you got on the and on the "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so that that's not of any discussion comm I think . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"you need some kind of C_P_U_ comm I guess . "
C,Task,"I suppose so . "
D,Task,"Mm comm I don't I dunno I don't think that's "
C,Task,"It is a simple C_P_U_ "
C,Minor,"but it doesn't "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah okay "
D,Minor,"but I d I I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_ . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"because it has to uh b "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Task,"I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm true true . True . "
C,Task,"So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ "
C,Task,"to know uh in which state you are "
C,Task,"and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And the case comm yeah we already discussed the case comm "
B,Task,"It's rubber . "
C,Task,"we wanted to make it from rubber "
B,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"and uh "
B,Elicit,"but but a hard rubber like this ? "
B,Elicit,"Or softer rubber "
B,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"Uh hard rubber I think . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"That's the easy to ha uh to to uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It bounces back from the floor where you throw it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah sure comm "
D,Task,"We have different colours . "
C,Other,"look . "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah "
B,Other,"this in different colours ? "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? "
C,Minor,"D "
D,Task,"No I don't think comm "
D,Task,"I think it's more round than square . "
B,Task,"Yeah it's a bit . "
B,Task,"But I think it should be a bit longer comm perhaps . "
D,Minor,"So it meets "
D,Task,"I think it meets more the young people than the older people . "
B,Task,"Yeah . I think so too . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But that's what we want comm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's our target . Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's our main target . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Lower than forty years comm I think "
D,Task,"it was . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Elicit,"and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ? "
D,Other,"Oh yeah "
D,Minor,"that that I think "
C,Minor,"So i "
D,Task,"I thought that was a quite good "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Because it's a gadget "
C,Task,"and you want to show it off comm of course . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah "
A,Task,"you have a fancy design comm then comm right away . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen comm "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Because it "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"you don't have to put it get it in your hand comm "
D,Task,"you can put it next to you "
D,Task,"and then dive it in "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's a good idea . "
D,Minor,"and . Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's a lot easier . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"alright . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"So comm so "
A,Minor,"Okay so "
C,Minor,"you got uh "
C,Elicit,"Did you write that down ? "
B,Minor,"And then "
C,Task,"Uh got a single curved uh rubber "
C,Task,"f uh fancy coloured remote control . "
D,Minor,"You can't you You can't "
D,Minor,"oh comm "
D,Task,"you c you can draw it on your paper "
D,Task,"and then load it on the "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you can uh "
A,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"It's pretty easy "
A,Task,"but I wrote it down . "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"And load it on the the user the server . "
B,Minor,"And "
A,Elicit,"What about the user interface comm "
A,Task,"there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think "
A,Task,"you have some ideas on that . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"I had what I just uh "
A,Task,"You you showed your drawing . "
B,Other,"I should again . "
B,Task,"I miss a few buttons comm "
B,Minor,"but . "
B,Minor,"Well . "
B,Minor,"At least uh "
B,Task,"what we should also have on comm I just remembered comm um a menu to go back through the first uh "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"if if you touch options comm you can't go back to this uh right away now . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"you have to go back . "
D,Task,"Yeah uh uh . "
B,Minor,"This "
D,Elicit,"Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Elicit,"With the minus and the plus . "
B,Minor,"I think it's "
D,Task,"I think it's easier than "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way comm "
D,Elicit,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"but I don't know what they think . "
C,Other,"Sorry ? "
B,Elicit,"Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"For sound and channel . "
C,Task,"Depends on the screen . "
B,Minor,"Th "
C,Task,"If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . "
C,Minor,"If you make it uh in a rectangle "
B,Minor,"Right well "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"if we make it like this comm I think if you "
C,Minor,"I so it's it's it's it's "
B,Task,"put it like this "
C,Task,"Square . "
D,Task,"I think it's it's easier to have it something like Oh a button uh minus here comm plus over here . A minus here comm plus over here . "
C,Other,"Oh comm okay . "
D,Task,"And on here . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The other buttons and on here the top . "
D,Task,"The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But I think I wou "
D,Task,"and the sound . "
B,Task,"I think that's a matter of what you're used to . "
D,Minor,"Something uh "
B,Task,"I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . "
B,Task,"And then the P_ in the mid in the middle "
B,Task,"and the sound uh in the middle . "
C,Other,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Something like "
D,Minor,"Sh "
C,Other,"Take your time . "
D,Task,"Plus minus plus uh "
B,Task,"Almost . "
D,Task,"minus . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"but I think when you are holding it comm you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus . "
D,Other,"Yeah "
D,Task,"I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"but I think "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"Perhaps I have some examples . "
C,Minor,"W "
C,Task,"We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . "
B,Minor,"I don't know "
D,Elicit,"Who's the usability engineering ? "
B,Task,"That's me . "
D,Elicit,"She is . "
B,Other,"But I'm going to look if I've got some examples "
B,Task,"'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
B,Minor,"The "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"'Cause they can use that better . "
C,Task,"Consistency . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"I have that those s numbers . "
B,Minor,"I Here is our here are uh "
D,Other,"Or a good watch . "
B,Task,"I don't really know . "
D,Minor,"B "
A,Task,"Everybody's searching in his data . "
D,Task,"Channel selection . Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Volume selection four times an hour "
B,Other,"Yeah "
B,Elicit,"but But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"So not how much n not how often it's used comm but "
B,Elicit,"W what's what's usual or normal . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"that depends on on on the remote . "
B,Minor,"Yes "
B,Task,"I'm looking here . "
B,Task,"But here's it's below comm "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"here also comm "
B,Task,"and now here's here's next to each other . "
B,Minor,"I think it's it's a "
D,Minor,"I think "
D,Task,"because I have two televisions at home . "
D,Task,"One is horizontal comm "
D,Task,"one is vertical comm "
D,Task,"so it depends . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"it does it doesn't really matter comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"Yeah . Depends . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other comm "
B,Task,"because you go higher and down . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm lower . "
B,Minor,"And the the pay the the "
B,Task,"the program is next to each other comm "
B,Task,"because you would go further and back . "
D,Task,"True . "
B,Task,"That's how it's is usually when I look here "
C,Minor,"Okay comm um . "
B,Task,"that's what I see . "
C,Task,"Let's cut to the chase . "
D,Other,"It's got to change . "
A,Minor,"Yeah well "
A,Task,"I think we have we don't have to decide about that now "
A,Minor,"how "
A,Elicit,"where we will put the buttons "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"Yeah is it is user interface . "
A,Minor,"just the "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"concepts . "
D,Task,"Component . "
B,Task,"This concept is in the actual design comm "
B,Task,"but you should know where you would place a "
C,Minor,"Okay comm well "
C,Minor,"le "
C,Task,"Yeah . Interface comm yeah . "
B,Elicit,"And the speech uh shall we implement that ? "
B,Minor,"Or uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah well "
A,Task,"we just heard about the new uh technology comm huh ? "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"I think it's it's easy for that comm "
C,Task,"Technologies comm uh . "
D,Task,"where are you comm but then it says I'm here . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Makes it possible to "
B,Task,"But then you should also find a place "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"You can talk into the corner . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm a microphone comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Not even necessary comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"because a lotta "
C,Task,"you can make a very sensitive microphone comm "
C,Task,"so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh "
B,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's also . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"over there . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"But that's not import I think that's not im very important "
B,Elicit,"in the middle or something . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"because yeah comm it doesn't matter where the microphone is . "
B,Task,"but you should uh decide where you want to put it . "
C,Other,"Ah okay comm sure comm okay comm "
B,Elicit,"Right ? "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Minor,"tha "
D,Task,"Um I think where it isn't seen "
C,Elicit,"Underneath ? "
D,Task,"the most . "
C,Task,"Indeed . It shouldn't be uh very uh visible . "
D,Task,"Inside . "
B,Task,"You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah sure comm why no "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out "
D,Minor,"I i "
D,Task,"between the round of the R_ . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it comm "
A,Task,"because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote comm huh comm the the speech control . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"where do you want to put it ? "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"maybe where the one hand "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"actually it does "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"because it you can you can find it better if you use it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"bu but "
B,Minor,"It's a way for you to uh "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"So it makes more sense "
B,Task,"just 'cause other remotes don't have that . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Elicit,"But are we talking about the button comm or about the microphone ? "
B,Task,"About a microphone comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"there is no button . "
A,Task,"because a microphone is very small thing comm "
A,Task,"but you can make it look like it's big "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so as its its really an important function of the remote . "
D,Task,"I think the left s under corner should be the best . "
D,Task,"Where isn't i it isn't most in sight . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . Well put it there . I don't mind . "
D,Task,"I think . "
C,Task,"That doesn't doesn't really matter . "
D,Task,"No . Actually doesn't . "
C,Minor,"Okay . So ? "
B,Task,"Alright . "
B,Elicit,"Any more uh "
A,Minor,"So well uh "
A,Task,"type comm supplements comm "
C,Task,"Interface type . "
A,Task,"anything . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm well "
A,Task,"we already s discussed that comm huh comm the the L_C_D_ "
C,Task,"The L_C_D_ yeah comm "
C,Minor,"uh supplements well the supplement is to "
A,Minor,"and "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think I thought the comm like you said comm like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy . "
C,Other,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen . "
D,Task,"If you want to go back you have to back button go back comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu . "
C,Minor,"Hey comm "
C,Minor,". "
B,Minor,"Um yeah . Yeah "
B,Task,"the the young people do like uh scroll uh "
C,Task,"Use the scroll . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? You do like it ? "
C,Task,"Yeah I think so too . "
C,Task,"So why not comm on on side . "
B,Minor,"Or at least "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"I don't know if it's really the scroll comm "
B,Task,"but the menu they like most comm "
B,Task,"and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh "
C,Task,"Fast comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah I think it is is faster . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"if you've got a settings comm if you "
D,Minor,"Becau "
D,Task,"I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options comm "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"but if you don't have a lot of option then "
B,Minor,"But you have it's f uh "
C,Task,"You have a lot of options comm "
B,Task,"we have five or four or something . "
C,Minor,"because when you use "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television comm you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . "
D,Minor,"Y "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm true . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down comm "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . "
C,Task,"Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use . "
D,Task,"Okay comm no problem . "
A,Task,"And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"which you can touch "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"and "
B,Task,"It's also different . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Well "
A,Task,"there's our five minutes uh warning . "
A,Elicit,"Um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components comm everyone ? "
D,Task,"Um . No comm "
D,Task,"colours are clear comm "
D,Task,"shape is clear comm "
A,Elicit,"Everybody think they can can "
D,Task,"material is clear . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Elicit,"what's the standard colour ? "
A,Elicit,"work for that ? "
D,Minor,"And a standard comm "
D,Task,"yeah "
A,Elicit,"Is there a standard colour ? "
D,Minor,"we don't "
D,Task,"no "
D,Task,"we have different colour . "
C,Minor,"I I "
D,Elicit,"How many colours are we going to "
C,Task,"You got you got different colours comm "
B,Task,"You should you should have a black one "
C,Task,"but you should have a standard colour . "
B,Task,"because uh I think black is standard . "
D,Task,"Black . Yeah comm black I think is is the standard . "
C,Other,"Black ? "
C,Minor,"With the with the yellow uh "
B,Minor,"But if you want to be different comm then uh "
D,Task,"Dark grey comm something like this this colour or something . "
C,Elicit,"Just a regular uh remote colour . "
D,Task,"Yeah like like yeah . "
C,Elicit,"And then have uh different covers uh to use . "
D,Task,"Or or silver . "
D,Task,"I think it's better to have silver nowadays . "
C,Task,"Silver comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Silver . "
D,Task,"I think you see more silver than black . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You see a lot of t uh silver televisions . "
A,Minor,"But still silver and black are "
B,Task,"Silver rubber . "
D,Task,"Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"well "
A,Task,"silver is new but also traditional comm "
A,Minor,"so uh "
D,Task,"I think we have silver comm black "
D,Task,"and between those is like I dunno s five colours between them or something . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Elicit,"w what about a yellow thing comm "
A,Minor,"I mean it "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"y I think it's better to "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah "
D,Task,"it'll be a banana yellow comm we have . "
A,Task,"could be ugly comm "
A,Task,"but it's definitely fancy . "
D,Task,"R red . "
C,Task,"Yeah th yeah . That's right . "
B,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Green comm wood comm brown . "
C,Task,"But if you use uh silver comm uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"True . "
C,Task,"When you use titanium comm silver is fancy comm "
C,Task,"but when you use silver rubber comm it isn't fancy . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Silver has to shine comm "
C,Task,"and rubber doesn't shine . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Especially when it's made of soft rubber like this . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"You understand ? "
D,Other,"Yeah comm I understand . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"I would think about colours like uh red comm yellow comm green comm blue comm "
D,Task,"Yeah o of course . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"just "
D,Task,"The fruity colours and the autumn colours comm like red and brown comm dark red and brown . "
C,Minor,"Fruity . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Just all kind of colour . "
C,Other,"Fruity loops . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Maroon . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
B,Elicit,"And and do we have to have a normal black one comm or uh "
A,Elicit,"Who's pinging ? "
B,Minor,"Is it "
D,Minor,"No . "
A,Minor,"You are pingin "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"You ping . "
A,Minor,"I thought we "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Elicit,"uh that wraps it up ? "
A,Elicit,"Everybody knows uh what to do ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I wrote it down here . I wrote it down here what to do um . "
C,Task,"not what to do . Not what to do . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"I don't know what to do comm "
B,Minor,"but . "
A,Task,"The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um here are the individual actions comm "
A,Task,"and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board comm "
B,Task,"Ooh . "
