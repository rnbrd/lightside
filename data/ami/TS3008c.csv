A,Elicit,"Okay comm all set ? "
A,Task,"Welcome to the conceptual design meeting . "
B,Task,"Uh comm okay . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"The agenda . "
A,Task,"The opening . "
A,Other,"I'll again be the secretary and make minutes comm take minutes comm "
A,Task,"uh and it will be three presentations comm just like the last meeting . "
A,Elicit,"So um comm who wants to start off ? "
A,Task,"Technical uh designer again ? "
B,Other,"Again . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Uh comm yeah . Uh comm before we begin it comm I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder comm "
A,Task,"but they're still not uh quite okay . "
A,Task,"It uh it uh still some technical difficulties "
A,Task,"so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read comm because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"But uh comm from now on I won't use my pen anymore comm so will be p just ordinary keyboard . "
B,Task,"Uh comm may be better comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Keyboard work . Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it will will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
C,Task,"Okay comm when we talk about uh components design comm um it's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of . "
C,Task,"Um comm a remote control consist of uh components "
C,Task,"and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . "
C,Task,"We have to choose th uh these uh wisely "
C,Task,"and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls . "
C,Task,"Um comm the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . "
C,Task,"Uh the properties of the case comm um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic "
C,Task,"uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah comm it feels uh good in your hand . "
C,Task,"Mm the buttons has to be uh solid too comm and the material is soft rubber . "
C,Task,"Uh I've got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber comm the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . "
C,Minor,"Mm "
C,Task,"It's okay . Yeah . "
C,Task,"I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case comm we must use a rubber push-buttons to "
C,Task,"uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design comm "
C,Task,"which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh "
C,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Task,"the energy source comm uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . "
C,Minor,"Um comm "
C,Task,"uh the basic battery comm "
C,Task,"which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um "
C,Task,"Uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah comm kinetic uh energy . "
C,Task,"Also in uh this one comm like in the watches comm "
C,Task,"but a remote control can lie on a table for a day comm and then you push uh a button and "
C,Task,"so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . "
C,Task,"Mm comm solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"uh also the case material comm "
C,Task,"uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber comm because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird . "
B,Task,"Oh titanium is probably trendy comm I think . "
D,Task,"That's true comm I guess . Yeah . "
B,Minor,". "
B,Task,"Well comm maybe a little bit expensive . "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Task,"Uh comm they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"the chip "
C,Task,"uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . "
C,Task,"Also comm the speaker in the remote control comm when we want to retrieve it . "
C,Task,"Um comm the base station is also off the shelf comm "
C,Task,"all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . "
C,Minor,"Mm comm "
C,Task,"I've told about uh the three first points . "
C,Task,"Mm comm the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter . "
C,Task,"Uh comm it's all uh off the shelf "
C,Task,"and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . "
C,Task,"Um comm another possibility . I uh yeah comm I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . "
C,Task,"Could be uh something special to our uh remote control comm "
C,Task,"and it's possible comm but it only cost a bit more comm "
C,Task,"but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros . "
A,Task,"Twelve and a half . "
C,Task,"Ah yeah . "
A,Task,"Actually "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm production cost . "
C,Task,"I th I got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one . "
C,Task,"You see uh a covers comm which can be "
A,Elicit,"What are those comm t tooth uh brushes comm or so "
C,Task,"Um comm I don't know . Um "
A,Minor,"But it's actually kind of uh "
B,Minor,"I "
A,Task,"well comm it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"You know the the cartoonish Alessi kind of design . "
C,Task,"Yes comm maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh "
A,Other,"And we can we can steal their ideas . "
C,Task,"maybe a kind of uh whole uh "
C,Minor,"um "
C,Task,"a whole set of uh different uh remote controls . "
C,Task,"Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Task,"with a huge variety of uh "
A,Task,"Well comm it's a possibility comm too . "
C,Task,"uh house uh stuff . "
B,Task,"Different colours also . "
C,Task,"Like uh maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this in the same style comm but "
A,Minor,"Uh-uh . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that'll be for the future comm I guess . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Task,"because we have to uh we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it . "
A,Task,"Next time we're here . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Definitely . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . That's okay . "
B,Minor,"Ah . "
B,Other,"Well comm I shall go to the next slide . Um "
B,Task,"um comm I still don't have any information about user requirements . "
B,Task,"I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh "
A,Task,"Oh comm we decided upon that in the last meeting . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements . "
A,Elicit,"Didn't we ? "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
B,Minor,"I ha I ha I have the I have "
A,Task,"Well comm tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi "
A,Minor,"Just "
B,Elicit,"nothing . "
A,Task,"no comm but we decided to use only b basic functions only . "
B,Task,"Well comm I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I dunno if they're maybe a little bit more comm but "
A,Task,"Well we maybe we can think of that later . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"W just "
A,Elicit,"these are the ones you already summed up in the "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I I uh well comm I pointed them out here comm just to make it a little bit easier . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Another function uh is of course we already discuss it on the side . "
B,Task,"Um comm I don't know what costs of it . "
B,Task,"Uh comm I've no idea about it . "
B,Task,"Uh comm I was also looking for what you said comm for I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . "
B,Task,"I don't know if that's a good idea comm or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . Production . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"If we got already uh something like a base . "
A,Task,"That might get redundant also maybe . "
A,Task,"I don't know what kind of information it would "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I don't know . "
B,Task,"I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But "
D,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm it's okay . "
C,Task,"Maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t to the remote control . "
B,Minor,"The remote control . "
B,Minor,"a little uh too A little bit "
D,Minor,"Then you "
D,Task,"and then you've got a flag s Very big R_C_ . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . That's not "
B,Task,"A little bit too big comm I think . "
A,Task,"It was not a good idea . "
B,Task,"Exactly . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Um comm yeah . Well comm the functions are are not more to discuss comm I think . "
A,Task,"No . No . "
B,Task,"It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no V_C_R_ or that kind of "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"uh comm so that's very easy . "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"But you do mention the next and previous uh button . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Next channel comm previous channel . "
B,Task,"Well comm that's next channel . I mean next channel . "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay comm o okay okay . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"oh comm I I got an email with with an uh a remote control with a base . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Task,"So comm it's uh just an idea . "
B,Task,"And I um uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small "
C,Task,"But you're the expert . "
D,Task,"I think it depends on the function . "
B,Task,"Well comm I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly comm but not for trendiness . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Maybe it "
D,Task,"Well comm if you save uh Perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly comm then we wouldn't im implement that of course . "
B,Minor,"Well uh "
B,Task,"okay comm that's your point . "
B,Minor,"Um comm yeah . Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I've nothing to s "
A,Task,"Well comm w when we only use basic functions comm we have the possibility to make the buttons larger . "
D,Task,"Oh comm that's right . "
B,Task,"Uh comm with a little bit larger comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I thought so comm but maybe with the "
A,Task,"Well comm I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons comm th th those two have yeah comm they have to be large . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that groups . "
A,Task,"Uh comm I mean th th the the two two basic buttons comm you know comm the to skip channels and to uh "
B,Elicit,"Large ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"I think yeah comm I don't know why comm but I think that is that's t trendy too comm "
B,Task,"Most the most used uh buttons . "
D,Minor,"Those are probably the the th "
A,Minor,"because that's the mo it it you know comm it's uh acc acc um accentu uh comm "
A,Elicit,"how do you say it ? "
A,Task,"It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big comm like t "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"True . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You did the research . "
A,Task,"And you want to acc accentuate that comm you know . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Sorry ? "
C,Task,"It's from your research . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Uh comm that was all y "
B,Task,"uh personal preference I didn't have . "
B,Task,"I didn't had any time left . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"No uh comm that's coo it's cool . "
D,Other,"You don't care . "
D,Other,"No comm sorry . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"Go away . "
D,Other,"Come on . "
B,Task,"It's there . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm click on it . "
D,Minor,". "
B,Other,"Couple time . "
D,Task,"Oh comm great . "
D,Task,"Well comm I've done some research again about trends on the internet . "
D,Task,"Um I've done some investigation comm and uh well I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan . "
D,Task,"Some uh some findings "
D,Task,"the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . "
D,Task,"Uh comm well comm we were going to imply that comm so that's nice . "
D,Task,"The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ . "
D,Task,"Uh comm our market really likes really likes that . "
D,Task,"And uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance comm the third point comm is a high ease of use . "
D,Task,"And uh comm well comm for the idea comm I've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people . "
D,Task,"Dark colours comm simple recognisable shapes . "
D,Task,"So we probably won't do that . "
D,Minor,"The younger market likes uh "
D,Task,"Well comm the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . "
D,Task,"I found this image comm which is uh Well comm it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables . "
D,Task,"I don't see the spongy part in it . "
D,Task,"But with a little bit of fancy "
A,Other,"Well maybe c then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then . "
D,Other,"Exactly . "
D,Task,"I got some ideas "
D,Task,"Uh well comm yeah comm pictures isn't really good word comm but um "
D,Task,"some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . "
D,Task,"Uh comm catchy colours . "
D,Task,"Fruit is uh yellow comm green comm red comm whatever . "
D,Task,"So comm remote controls in in catchy colours . "
A,Task,"It doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours . "
D,Task,"Uh comm no comm we don't want dark colours . "
A,Task,"Not the dark colours ? Okay . "
D,Task,"No comm I just put them there to uh comm yeah comm uh for general idea . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"And uh comm the docking st "
D,Task,"uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself . "
D,Minor,"But to "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm the "
D,Task,"To implement some spongy thing comm maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . "
D,Task,"At the bottom of the docking station or whatever . "
D,Task,"And uh comm we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah "
D,Elicit,"uh uh v how do you say ? "
A,Task,"For diversity or something . Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . "
B,Minor,"Well comm how uh "
D,Task,"I mean it it it reaches a different market uh comm but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . Yes . "
B,Elicit,"But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control ? "
A,Task,"No comm but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm there's there's always a "
B,Task,"Uh comm make it a banana ? "
A,Task,"It's like a pear or something . "
D,Task,"Well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control . "
D,Task,"I mean I think this part of the R_C_ uh well the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons comm I guess . "
A,Minor,"No comm I don't think you have to do it like "
D,Task,"So you you can put some fruity things "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but it that doesn't have to remind you comm you know comm like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit comm but just comm you know comm like the the the the round curves . "
D,Task,"No comm of course not . "
A,Task,"And so y I I think this y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something . "
D,Minor,"Especially i "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but th "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . Yeah comm exactly . "
B,Minor,"yeah comm but that "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but that's "
D,Task,"If we make it little bit greenish . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"You do get the idea comm eh ? The fruity kind of round "
B,Task,"Yeah uh uh "
D,Task,"A and we could use one of these for "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
D,Elicit,"the uh w what is it ? "
A,Elicit,"Yeah comm uh yeah comm I don't know . "
C,Task,"Grapes . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Minor,"Isn't "
A,Task,"Uh comm this is a b yeah . "
D,Other,"Wha whatever . "
B,Task,"But d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . Of course we have uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"we have a very big uh the s "
D,Task,"Well comm w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . "
C,Task,"For a big team of artists . "
A,Task,"Of d design team comm yeah . "
D,Task,"This is then the uh pear . "
D,Task,"I don't know the English word comm so forget it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but "
A,Task,"It's pear comm I guess . "
D,Task,"And um comm maybe comm yeah comm a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control comm but m yeah . "
C,Minor,"But uh but I think we don't have to make "
C,Task,"we can't make all uh ten designs . "
A,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"We have to make one design I th I I think . "
A,Task,"No comm but I think it's it's already what we were were up to . "
D,Task,"Mayb maybe two or three . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh comm it's it doesn't have to resemble uh what I already said comm a specific piece of fruit comm but just comm you know comm like a fruity thing going on . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"No sure comm "
D,Minor,"but but "
D,Task,"B but that's great comm "
A,Task,"And it's it looks fruity to me . "
D,Minor,"and and and what I was "
D,Task,"what what I was saying comm the catchy colours "
A,Minor,"And uh comm but I do like the "
A,Task,"yeah comm I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh comm a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But pictures of fruit comm vegetables vegetables "
A,Task,"Maybe it's too much comm you know . "
B,Task,"But comm we we have to um There have to be the the the the firm colours comm our own uh colours has to be in it . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm uh not really . Pictures was a was a bad word comm but "
A,Minor,"Okay comm but what are the "
A,Task,"This is yellow . "
D,Task,"Well we c yeah . "
B,Task,"Yellow comm a Real Reaction . "
C,Task,"Yes comm you can put a logo on top of it . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
A,Task,"But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here . "
C,Task,"Yes comm it's really fruity . "
B,Minor,"We uh f "
D,Task,"I can't draw with this thing comm "
D,Other,"but I'll try . "
B,Minor,"A yellow do "
D,Task,"If this is our docking station comm we can make our logo over here . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm yeah . "
D,Task,"It doesn't work . "
D,Minor,"And then "
B,Task,"Yeah comm and the button then . "
C,Task,"With a strawberry on top . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do "
D,Task,"Well comm the button button over here or whatever comm "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
D,Task,"On the front comm of course comm "
D,Task,"because else you can't find it . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Well comm that were my ideas a little bit . "
D,Other,"I'll close 'em down . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Um comm go away . "
A,Task,"Okay comm you can you open the conceptual design presentation ? "
D,Other,"Conceptual design comm yes . "
A,Task,"See what was on the agenda . "
B,Other,"Lazy . "
D,Task,"The agenda . "
A,Task,"This is his own remote . "
A,Task,"Because um comm maybe we can start with the technical uh functions comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but I don't think it's there "
A,Minor,"uh comm yeah um comm "
A,Elicit,"do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display comm for example ? "
D,Task,"Well comm it's nice comm of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it . "
C,Minor,"Only if we "
C,Task,"Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it comm for the channel you're on . "
D,Minor,"I mean "
A,Task,"Me neither . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but it should be li like this big comm and I don't think "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but it's so "
C,Task,"No comm no comm only the T_V_ channel with the with uh with uh four programmes . "
A,Task,"I don't think we should do it . "
C,Task,"You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button . "
D,Task,"Yes sure comm but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen comm because "
C,Task,"Yes comm it can "
C,Minor,"On your "
C,Task,"No comm on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . "
C,Elicit,"So why not on your remote ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but no . I do I think it's a bit redundant comm actually . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I don't know . "
A,Task,"And it's also not I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something comm "
B,Elicit,"Well well what would you display on it then ? "
A,Minor,"it's "
C,Task,"Uh comm programme uh information or or or or g or a guide "
D,Task,"Programme information . "
B,Elicit,"But is it isn't that a already on T_V_ comm a lot of new T_V_s ? "
D,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"on t on teletext comm yes . Also on the internet . "
D,Task,"Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a "
C,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"But you're already watching the T_V_ comm you're not gonna watch your remote control . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes comm but you also want to know what's next . "
D,Task,"But then we also uh w need to bring out a line of T_V_s "
D,Task,"which we were planning to comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"and we also have to yeah . "
D,Other,"but whatever . "
D,Task,"Because the T_V_ has to send information back to the R_C_ comm and I don't know if that's possible . "
C,Task,"Yes comm that's uh really possible . "
D,Task,"Yes comm yes comm o of course it's possible comm "
D,Task,"but you gotta uh implement it in the T_V_s comm and I don't think everyone's gonna buy a Real Reaction T_V_ within a month after the release of our uh remote control . "
B,Minor,"And I also "
A,Task,"I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an L_C_D_ in it comm "
A,Task,"but I I really don't think it's a good n goo "
A,Minor,"because it also doesn't stroke with "
A,Minor,"we wanted uh c "
A,Task,"When we talk about the materials comm uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . "
A,Task,"It was our idea comm you know comm to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . "
A,Task,"You know comm it's like more vulnerable comm "
A,Task,"and it adds nothing really comm you know . "
D,Task,"That's true comm that's true comm it breaks f yeah comm it it it's not very solid comm it's uh frag fragile . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . You could make it comm but it's just it it doesn't I don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after . "
D,Task,"No . No . I don't think so ei either . "
A,Task,"But that's my opinion . "
A,Minor,"Well comm you you y "
A,Task,"Okay comm we can vote for it . "
A,Task,"You want the L_C_D_ display . I don't want to and he doesn't comm so it's up to him . "
C,Minor,"No . "
D,Other,". Ah . "
A,Minor,"If we wanna "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I dunno . "
A,Task,"And I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of veto veto uh rights . "
B,Task,". Oh comm okay . "
D,Other,"Bastard . "
A,Minor,"So I can also say "
B,Other,"We can you away . "
A,Minor,"But did we skip the "
A,Other,"Yeah comm you could do "
A,Elicit,"m but what what i so what i but do you think we should "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I don't know . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm uh I i if it's it's a simple p "
A,Task,"We're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . So "
B,Task,"No comm that that's right comm "
C,Minor,"No uh um "
B,Other,"and uh I also have to think about new functions comm maybe buttons or something like that to control it . "
B,Minor,"Kind of L_C_D_ or something or "
C,Task,"Y yes comm you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I guess . "
B,Elicit,"But how does it display then ? "
B,Elicit,"W when I go to the second channel comm what what does it show me ? "
C,Task,"Uh comm then you push a button . "
C,Task,"The title and the information about the programme . "
B,Elicit,"About that programme ? "
C,Minor,"But but uh "
C,Task,"yeah comm what he said was right comm about the televisions comm they have to be uh customised to the "
A,Task,"Nah comm that's not gonna work . "
C,Task,"But maybe in future it will be a giant hit comm and when you are the first "
D,Minor,"No . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"you have the biggest uh "
A,Task,"Oh comm well uh I've seen it done before . "
A,Task,"Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes comm they have d L_C_D_ displays comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but then it's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling . "
A,Task,"So it's that that's what I've seen . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's true comm "
C,Task,"Yes comm you can put uh a little L_C_D_ display on it with uh with lots of information . "
D,Minor,"if you uh Yeah . "
A,Task,"But it just it j it doesn't doesn't match with the our whole basic concept . "
C,Task,"But uh I haven't thought about it . "
C,Task,"But whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh uh screen on top of it comm it i it isn't vulnerable . "
A,Task,"Well yeah comm yeah comm okay . That's maybe not the most important comm "
C,Task,"You can throw with it and "
A,Minor,"but it's just "
B,Elicit,"Is it fashion ? "
C,Task,"When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it comm it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from "
A,Task,"I don't think so . "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"That's not up to you . That's up to market if i if it's trendy . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm well do you ha do you have to You haven't looked after the trendiness of L_C_D_ displays comm have you ? "
D,Minor,"No . "
B,Minor,"Because our our motto is we put fashion "
D,Task,"Well comm I think it's uh I think it's pretty trendy comm to be honest comm "
D,Minor,"uh but um I don't know if if if "
D,Task,"well comm I'm coming back to the costs again comm but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . "
D,Task,"And I think uh especially colour L_C_D_ comm which is indeed pretty trendy . But I don't think Uh comm I think it will be too expensive . "
C,Task,"But uh I've got a the email with uh with the possibilities . And L_C_D_ was a possibility for the remote control . "
A,Minor,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"So why don't we use it . "
D,Elicit,"Uh comm did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh L_C_D_ or uh coloured L_C_D_ ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but we're gonna if it "
B,Task,"Yeah comm if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured . "
B,Minor,"Coloured "
D,Task,"Yeah really comm "
D,Minor,"if y if you c i "
B,Task,"If you have black and white or something comm or grey comm that's "
D,Task,"I in in two thousand and four you can't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme . "
A,Minor,"Then uh then you better don't yeah comm d "
D,Task,"Really . "
C,Task,"No comm but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or "
C,Task,"But comm mm comm I alf I also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it . "
C,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"Uh uh I really don't feel the whole idea of an L_C_D_ display . "
C,Minor,"I didn't think that "
A,Other,"I'm sorry . "
A,Task,"It can't co you cannot convince me . "
A,Elicit,"I don't know how well how to with you guys comm but "
A,Task,"I don't really feel it . "
A,Minor,"We already we're uh "
B,Task,"It's too much uh maybe uh with with the L_C_D_ and the docking station and "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we already have the the th th th base station gadgets comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"and want and it uh uh comm do "
A,Task,"it has to be a simple design comm which sturdy comm which soft "
C,Minor,"Yes comm but o on the "
D,Task,"W we've we've gotta find a balance comm of course . "
B,Task,"With one thing special . "
D,Minor,"And I think "
B,Task,"Not a whole package of specialty . "
A,Minor,"I don't think "
A,Minor,"I j uh comm "
A,Task,"and really comm I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything comm you know comm on a design level . "
A,Task,"Uh comm I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs . "
C,Minor,"No comm when y "
A,Minor,"Y we want to "
C,Minor,"But it look "
A,Task,"it's simplicity comm w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons comm so you don't need an L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"Yes comm but that remote controls are already on the market . The simple "
A,Task,"It doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote . "
C,Task,"Yes comm but but when you want to have something special "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but we already have the docking station comm which is "
C,Task,"Yes comm but you had a picture of it from another company . "
D,Task,"We have a pear . "
B,Minor,"And uh the "
A,Task,"It has to be developed comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"but no comm but it that's "
A,Task,"that's our that's our killer feature . "
B,Task,"It's just an it's just an idea . "
A,Task,"That's our what makes it special . "
B,Minor,"It's a it's "
C,Task,"Yes comm it was already made . Tha the remote control on the docking station . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we're gonna develop our own r n docking station . "
B,Task,"True . "
D,Elicit,"Is that so ? Was it it wasn't just a prototype ? "
C,Task,"Yes comm he have a picture of it . "
B,Minor,"Well uh I uh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I dunno . "
D,Task,"Exactly comm "
D,Task,"I've never seen it in a store . "
A,Task,"Uh comm but re we really have to cut this off comm "
A,Minor,"I re I know you I I I I "
A,Task,"I get the idea you really like it comm you know comm the the L_C_D_ thing comm but I I think it's it's not a good idea comm and we have already mentioned all the arguments . "
A,Minor,"I don't uh comm "
A,Elicit,"do you guys agre How do you guys think ? "
A,Minor,"I d "
B,Task,"No comm it's too much . "
D,Task,"I think it's a little too much comm yeah . "
B,Task,"It's overdone . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we s skip the L_C_D_ display . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"I'm sorry comm "
A,Other,"maybe you can do something if we are at your own place comm or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something . "
B,Minor,"Democratically . "
D,Minor,"No . "
C,Minor,"Mayb "
D,Minor,". "
C,Other,"I will rule the world with it . "
A,Minor,"But "
D,Other,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Probably so . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"But for the technical part . "
A,Task,"The m material comm I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . Uh "
C,Task,"Yes comm maybe a bit of a cushion is "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah comm p Exactly . "
A,Task,"This is what it w Yeah comm but it it was already what we're uh we're after comm you know comm to give it uh comm you know comm the soft touch in your hands "
D,Task,"Yeah comm for the spongy uh feel . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Other,"With a spongy Bob feel . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"and also to comm know comm like "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that is y the b airbag kind of thing . "
C,Minor,"Like a b "
C,Task,"yes . "
A,Task,"You can st throw it at your little brother's head . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you just can drop it . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm airbag . "
D,Other,"If you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Yeah . No no no comm not that comfy . "
C,Minor,"Maybe it "
C,Task,"but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah . Yeah . Okay comm that's a that's a good point . "
A,Task,"And that's why I like the dark t col dark colour bit comm you know comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"because it may be the design uh comm it's uh maybe it is a bit of the "
B,Task,"But not black I think . "
A,Task,"it's a bit nineties maybe comm what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point . "
D,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"Well if if it's fruit and vegetables comm it have to be colourful . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's that's true comm but but it has to be a little big solid . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm b yeah comm that's what w I I was pointing at . "
B,Minor,"But can we ge uh uh "
A,Task,"It mustn't be too comm n you know comm th too overwhelming comm "
A,Minor,"then when you put it on your just "
B,Task,"Can we combine it or something ? Uh with uh yellow and black ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm maybe so . "
B,Task,"Make it a bee ? "
D,Other,"What ? "
B,Task,"A bee . "
D,Task,"Oh comm a bee . Oh . "
A,Task,"No comm uh I don't like the yellow and black combination . "
A,Task,"But it is our company colours . Apparently . "
C,Other,"Yes comm real real good colours . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's our yeah . We we have to use yellow . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"I don't like yellow comm "
A,Minor,"and uh maybe I don't know . "
D,Task,"Well comm we can as as I "
C,Task,"But that's not really fruity . "
D,Task,"draw really nicely over there . "
D,Task,"We can put the logo on our uh on our base station . "
D,Task,"Uh comm yeah . And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself . "
A,Minor,"But "
D,Minor,"But comm i "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm but what uh comm what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ? "
C,Task,"Uh fronts "
C,Minor,"of the "
C,Task,"We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the "
A,Elicit,"Should we do that ? "
C,Task,"telephone . "
A,Task,"I don't think you we should do that . "
A,Task,"Maybe just bring it out in different colours comm "
B,Minor,"Different fronts . "
A,Task,"but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards comm that's also too much . "
D,Task,"Yeah . I guess that's that's enough . "
A,Task,"People don't wanna spend more money on their remote control comm I guess . "
D,Task,"That's way too Nokia . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh comm you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants comm yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Are these designs ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm definitely . Just bring more designs on the market . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm Three three or four uh four uh colours comm or something like that . "
A,Minor,"But uh comm without gon uh "
D,Task,"Why not comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"okay . "
A,Elicit,"So comm are we through the technical part then ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So we uh agreed upon uh n uh well comm not u unanimously or how you call it comm but Yeah . "
C,Task,"It this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles . "
B,Task,"Well comm yeah comm "
B,Minor,"the "
B,Task,"Three to one . "
B,Minor,"That's "
A,Task,"The materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite okay . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"O o only only the last point your "
B,Elicit,"And tita uh titanium comm is uh is is it a no ? "
C,Minor,"Yes comm "
A,Task,"no titanium's not not out of question comm I guess . "
B,Minor,"Is "
C,Minor,"But also w "
B,Task,"It's just like that comm th this titanium . "
C,Task,"Yes comm b bu but when we use s soft "
A,Elicit,"But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium comm as well ? "
C,Minor,"mm "
D,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"Makes it in a homogeneous uh design . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"No comm not all comm not all of them . "
C,Task,"But it it then it uh you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff "
C,Task,"when you throw with uh titanium with your remote control . "
A,Task,"It will it will break other stuff w when it's plastic comm as well . "
C,Minor,"No uh comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"titanium is a bit uh it's a bit harder . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
A,Minor,"No comm but uh uh comm you should ma Yeah . "
C,Minor,"But also on the colours comm the young "
A,Task,"Okay comm think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium . "
A,Elicit,"Well would it be more trendy ? More chic ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think it I think it does . "
B,Task,"Uh comm I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic . "
C,Task,"Yes comm but a titanium remote control comm when you're uh watching T_V_ uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty comm and the "
B,Task,"In trendy things . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm o "
D,Task,"On the other hand comm if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's cold in the winter . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But the question is i then it's comm you know comm is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh comm know comm like uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's true comm that's true . "
C,Task,"Sports and gaming . Define "
A,Task,"When you make it titanium comm it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need . "
A,Task,"And when it's big and plastic comm it's like some fun stuff you can always have around . "
A,Task,"It's always fun to have something big and plastic around . "
D,Task,"Yes . Yeah . "
B,Task,"You have that uh M_P_ three player of Nike comm I saw . "
B,Elicit,"Isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber ? "
C,Task,"Yes comm it's w but it is uh plastic . "
B,Minor,"Isn't it "
B,Task,"Is plastic ? Well comm it's titanium looking . "
C,Task,"Yes comm w we can do that on the on the "
D,Other,"What ? "
B,Other,"Yeah comm he is . Here he is . "
B,Task,"Uh comm the I don't know if you know the M_P_ three player of Nike . "
B,Task,"'Kay comm uh that that's very uh with rubber comm so it's very "
D,Task,"Oh comm yeah . Okay comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's beautiful . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I see . "
C,Task,"We can make this as a style too . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm but but but "
B,Task,"rough . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm this is uh just a "
A,Minor,"Oh comm maybe th maybe this is an "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I th I think that's difficult comm "
D,Task,"because uh that's different material comm and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of "
C,Task,"No comm we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then comm I guess it's it's nice to have one of these . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"No comm I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it . "
A,Task,"You know comm like the the soft stuff comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but I don't know if it's possible . "
C,Task,"I don't have the information . Uh comm I I didn't got it "
A,Task,"But you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"True . "
A,Task,"But make it just like shiny . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah comm true . "
A,Minor,"Maybe we should uh shou "
C,Task,"Like the M_P_ three player . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm maybe that's good idea comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"But if you want to la uh yeah comm last longer than two weeks or something like that comm you can maybe "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"And uh and "
A,Minor,"maybe we sh should we t I don't know if we should talk about uh comm "
A,Elicit,"how how much time have we got left ? "
C,Minor,"Uh comm in a lot of other uh "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Minor,"What time does "
A,Task,"Forty minutes . "
C,Task,"in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry . Uh comm they began with uh t typical uh leather bags comm but then they became stylish comm with all all si all sort of colours comm "
C,Task,"and w kind of fon of uh of fronts comm like we can use on the telephone and it "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Like Eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and "
A,Task,"You putting in different colours . "
C,Task,"Yes comm and and styles . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"They have uh also uh a kind of uh um "
C,Task,"uh roses on it comm "
C,Minor,"a and uh "
D,Task,"Uh yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . Yeah comm but w yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Well comm it is . It's a possibility . "
A,Task,"But comm let's think about the bas "
C,Task,"Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance comm but with new uh with new colours comm new "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"New prints on it . Yep . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"yes . "
A,Task,"But wha th our basic idea y I mean comm you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials comm like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it . "
A,Task,"And and pro and lights . We have to incorporate the lights too . "
A,Task,"But comm uh do w gonna gonna are we going to give it a two-tone colour look comm like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ? "
A,Elicit,"Is that the idea ? Is that a good idea ? "
D,Elicit,"How do you mean ? "
D,Minor,"Th th the uh base in a in another "
B,Task,"The rubber . "
A,Minor,"How many colours are we how many colours are we gonna we're uh uh f uh f "
A,Task,"Only five minutes left comm by the way . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"How many colours are we gonna give it ? "
A,Elicit,"Like two-tone colour ? T "
C,Task,"There there are three uh components three components type . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Uh no comm not too much I think . "
C,Task,"You have the buttons comm the the case uh itself comm and the rubber and th "
D,Minor,"How the buttons yeah . "
A,Task,"I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons comm and the cushions as well should be in another colour . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Or you just make uh one colour comm uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm but not more than "
B,Task,"In in another colour . "
A,Minor,"Well comm yeah comm it's "
B,Task,"Not more than two colours I think . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"No comm definitely not . "
B,Task,"It's a g a little bit too flashy . "
A,Task,"Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting . "
D,Task,"Yes comm definitely . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm or or when you use the buttons as black comm it you can use two colours as well uh "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"But we have to uh think of some other uh important things . "
A,Task,"Uh oh yeah comm the the functionalities of the the buttons . "
B,Elicit,"The funct yeah comm I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"No comm I think that's too vulnerable . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think this is okay comm "
A,Minor,"the "
A,Task,"so we have the basic . "
A,Task,"Then we have the numbers . We have the power button . We have we have a teletext button . "
B,Task,"The volume comm teletext and "
A,Task,"And maybe want to access a a menu or something . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but that's that's I was thinking that's gotta be on the television . "
A,Task,"Most T_V_s have a menu . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but I think you ha I really need a menu button . "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah comm b "
A,Minor,"That's just i the only button only "
B,Elicit,"Yeah comm but wha what kind of menu ? "
A,Minor,"You know comm I "
B,Elicit,"Is uh isn't that different from every television ? "
A,Task,"No comm I think most T_V_s have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings . And so "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm if it's c if "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh "
A,Task,"But that that covers all the all the other settings . It covers everything then . "
D,Minor,"and if the T_V_ doesn't have a menu comm then "
C,Task,"But then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever . "
A,Minor,"No comm you can use the "
A,Task,"And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Th in that way we have like only the numbers comm the power button comm skip and volume comm and then uh uh ten uh rem "
D,Minor,"Mm comm yeah . "
D,Task,"A mute and a teletext and a menu . "
A,Task,"uh yeah comm mute . A teletext and a menu comm and then then i that's it . "
B,Minor,"Mute . "
D,Task,"That's all . "
A,Task,"It's all we need . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay comm uh another stuf some stuff about the the the design of the docking station . "
D,Task,"Great . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay comm that's not mu not much functions . So "
A,Minor,"Something important about a s uh comm no comm uh which sh uh "
A,Task,"should remind us of the remote itself comm I guess . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm definitely . "
A,Task,"Uh comm in one colour . "
D,Elicit,"Are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there ? "
A,Minor,"Just use "
A,Task,"I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions comm pads and things on the s uh side . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's true comm that's true . "
A,Task,"And we will make it spongy and "
A,Task,"and uh and uh well comm the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did "
A,Task,"I think this is kind of fruity comm you know . Just round shapes with uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it's kinda fruity comm and with th with catchy colours uh uh w "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but we're gonna have to we really have to think "
A,Task,"I think colours is very important comm because it has to be flashy comm but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying comm "
A,Minor,"that when you uh comm know comm "
A,Task,"some things is just over the top comm "
A,Task,"and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks comm you it just gets annoying comm because it's so big and flashy . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm definitely . "
A,Task,"Uh comm it has to be some level of subtlety comm "
A,Task,"but we have to still have to think of how we manage to uh "
A,Task,"to get to that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Guess we're through then . "
D,Task,"I guess so . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"But we I think also we just "
A,Task,"so we have to do something with colour but also comm I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind . "
A,Minor,"I think that's uh adds to the "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"too much colour maybe m um "
B,Task,"Too much colour comm i it uh when you got it in a living room comm it's too much maybe "
A,Task,"But our des design experts will uh work that out . "
D,Minor,"Yea yeah . "
B,Minor,". It has to be "
A,Task,"Okay comm well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So we will wrap up . "
D,Task,"Something like that . "
A,Elicit,"Or is there anything we'd like to discuss ? "
D,Task,"I guess not . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Do you comm guys ? "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"No ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Well comm you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the "
D,Task,"In the shared folder . "
B,Task,"Oh comm okay comm yeah . "
A,Task,"pro probably . "
A,Task,"Yeah uh no comm for su for sure "
A,Other,"because I'm will now type them out . "
C,Elicit,"What are we going to do now ? "
A,Minor,"Uh comm y yeah . "
D,Task,"You'll see in you email comm I guess . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I think uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I don't know . I don't know . "
B,Task,"I hope so . "
B,Task,"And the other thing is that you don't have kind of prototype or something like that . "
B,Task,"You see a kinda prototype you can a little bit more uh "
C,Other,"I will make one in the next uh twenty minutes . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Construct one comm yeah . "
A,Other,"But toilet paper roll and uh "
B,Other,"With you laptop ? Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Oh my God . "
D,Task,"Alright comm shall we get back to work ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Great . "
A,Task,"I was waiting for the l last message comm but "
B,Task,"Well you are . We're not . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Bastard . "
C,Task,"Back to the pen . "
D,Other,"You lazy "
A,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
