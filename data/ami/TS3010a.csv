A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"That's it . "
A,Task,"So that was two . "
A,Task,"Now next . The budget . "
A,Minor,"The b Uh "
A,Task,"we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . "
A,Task,"And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"now we have to think about what we will make . "
A,Task,"First I wanna hear from you . "
A,Elicit,"Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . "
A,Task,"So "
C,Other,"Uh I will start . "
A,Minor,"F first . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"Big one comm they are uh not easy to use . "
C,Task,"Um I have one set and uh a remote control comm "
C,Task,"when I dropped it comm uh it broke . "
C,Task,"So that won't be uh our goal comm I think . "
B,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"And uh g big buttons comm "
C,Task,"m uh that's easier to use than uh I think . "
C,Task,"Not all the small buttons comm you don't know "
A,Elicit,"Is this positive or negative comm that uh big buttons ? "
C,Task,"Big buttons comm positive . "
A,Task,"Positive . "
C,Task,"All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control comm you won't know what they're working for . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"What are your experiences ? "
B,Task,"Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . "
B,Task,"And that it controls the channels and the the volume . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . "
B,Task,"So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it . "
B,Task,"And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light comm and uh and you see that it's working . "
B,Minor,"And uh yeah . Uh "
A,Elicit,"So and do they always have that ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but "
B,Task,"No no no . "
B,Task,"But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that . "
A,Task,"It's easy to you . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"Uh at home we have a T_V_ comm a video uh recorder comm a D_V_D_ player comm and a satellite receiver . "
D,Task,"We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Task,"That's not really ea easy . "
C,Other,"Help also . Thank you . "
D,Task,"So it would be nice if we have one for all . "
D,Task,"And we also had a remote control for our radio set . "
D,Task,"But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it comm "
D,Task,"and you didn't know which one was what . "
D,Task,"And it was uh uh v not easy to use . "
D,Task,"So we n barely used it . "
A,Task,"Okay so they have too much . "
A,Other,"So next . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . "
A,Elicit,"So what ideas do you have for it comm for the new remote control ? "
A,Elicit,"What what does it have to have ? "
C,Task,"The weight . Not not too heavy . "
A,Task,"Not too heavy . "
C,Task,"Not much buttons . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Bust-free . "
C,Task,"That when you drop it comm it won't break . "
C,Task,"Like uh some kind of rubber on it . "
C,Task,"Or hard uh hard plastic . "
C,Task,"Uh buttons not too small . "
C,Task,"Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control comm sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"When you push a but a button on the T_V_ comm then you hear some uh some sort of bleep . "
A,Other,"Like a phone . "
C,Task,"And then you uh comm hey there there's remote control . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
C,Elicit,"Next . "
A,Minor,"that's . "
B,Task,"Yeah well that's that are good ideas . Uh "
B,Task,"Yeah well the LED on the corner comm that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And looking on the budget comm not too expensive uh material . "
B,Task,"So probably plastic or something . Uh "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view comm it also has to look nice . "
D,Task,"Or you won't sell it . "
A,Elicit,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"And um yeah uh "
D,Task,"on our website we can see what products we already have . "
D,Task,"And it should work with as many uh as possible of them . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"This is It has to be compatible with other things . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I have one more idea . "
C,Task,"Just popped up . "
A,Elicit,"Yes ? "
C,Task,"Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . "
C,Task,"So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks . "
A,Task,"No battery use . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"more ideas ? "
B,Task,"Mm no . "
A,Task,"No okay . "
A,Task,"It's only the first ideas . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Next meeting comm half an hour . "
