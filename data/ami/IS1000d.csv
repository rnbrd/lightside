A,Elicit,"Did you get my email with the slides ? "
A,Task,"Ah . "
A,Task,"Tricky . "
C,Other,"I guess I have to change the pen "
C,Task,"otherwise . Will be completely different . "
A,Task,"Dunno . "
A,Task,"Maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . "
A,Task,"Might be seat floor rather than person . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"put it back . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"And do you think it's . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Jo's making faces at me . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So . "
B,Task,"Matthew is uh late again . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"Probably an important man . "
B,Minor,"Um . So well "
B,Task,"it is important for him to be here uh . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So what can you ? "
B,Minor,"He he he "
B,Elicit,"You did work together didn't you ? "
C,Task,"Yeah we will yeah comm "
C,Task,"so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting comm "
C,Task,"but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer . I think we can put on the here . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yes . Yes . "
C,Minor,"Uh basically w yeah "
C,Task,"we we designed the two uh items . "
B,Other,"Mm . Um yes "
C,Elicit,"Um comm can we have a phone comm "
B,Minor,"but w we "
C,Minor,"can someone "
B,Task,"Yes comm maybe we should phone him . "
C,Task,"it's really w well designed . "
B,Minor,"Um well Um comm "
A,Task,"Mm . "
A,Other,"Mm comm object tracking . "
B,Task,"when he is not here "
B,Task,"we will just we just have to continue . "
B,Minor,"Um so "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"just for record I I will take uh notes again . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"And um well "
B,Task,"first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again "
B,Task,"that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"when you stay in it's good comm "
B,Task,"when you don't stay in you have to redesign . "
B,Task,"There is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter . "
B,Task,"So we have to consider that . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
B,Other,"Good . "
B,Minor,"Um so "
B,Task,"maybe Anna comm you can have your presentation . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"we can't no "
A,Task,"we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design . "
B,Minor,"Okay "
B,Other,"Matthew . Nice uh you are here . "
C,Other,"Great . "
B,Other,"Great . Great . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Task,"ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Other,"I will start by the the basic one "
C,Task,"that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually comm right comm seven eight Euros comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"and uh well "
C,Task,"first for both they have um a special shape comm "
C,Task,"maybe the designer can uh explain better than me comm "
C,Task,"but uh it's like a surf board . "
C,Task,"And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ comm maybe the web comm "
A,Other,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Task,"and uh it's kind of interesting shape "
C,Task,"because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff . "
D,Task,"Or browse . "
C,Task,"And also it's not too far from um a mobile . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So people are used to that kind of shape comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"right . "
C,Task,"Don't take care too much about the colour "
C,Minor,"because w "
C,Task,"yeah "
D,Task,"Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . "
C,Minor,"we don't take "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led "
B,Task,"Eye . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I yeah . "
C,Task,"yeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_ comm "
D,Task,"L_E_D_ . "
C,Task,"the on-off button comm in red . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Here would be the volume . On the on the left comm "
A,Other,"Oh yeah . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm hmm . "
C,Minor,"okay comm so "
C,Task,"easy to turn on t and off . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"And um so "
C,Task,"this is a very cheap version "
C,Minor,"so there are "
C,Task,"maybe you can carry on uh Matthew . "
D,Task,"Also so you have uh uh browsing the channels comm actually "
D,Task,"so you can go up and down the channels comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"uh comm if you have a video or something you can forward comm back . "
C,Elicit,"How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_ comm by the way ? "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"no no no comm "
D,Minor,"this is a single this "
D,Task,"this is a model with just the T_V_ one . "
C,Other,"Okay yeah . Yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"No no "
B,Other,"Ah comm okay . "
D,Minor,"just "
D,Other,"sorry comm "
D,Task,"this is a standard T_V_ one comm "
D,Task,"we are not talking about that . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"and then we have usually there twelve keys "
D,Task,"but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . "
D,Task,"And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . Actually . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay so "
A,Task,"it's it's t a very basic remote then comm "
A,Minor,"it's only "
D,Task,"It's a very basic minimal thing "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"which you can "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"which is which is also available in the market comm "
D,Minor,"actually that's what it that it i "
D,Task,"and would cost us to build it about eight Euros . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Seven comm eight comm ei eight Euros . "
B,Task,"Exce except for the for the special shape comm the surfing board comm it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"this one model "
D,Minor,"and uh "
A,Elicit,"Can I see ? "
D,Task,"yeah . Sure . "
A,Other,"Thanks . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,"I like the volume control comm that's good . "
D,Task,"Th this is a magic one "
D,Task,"but I know we don't want to talk about that comm "
D,Minor,"you know like "
D,Task,"uh i i i it is a very futuristic comm "
D,Task,"it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future comm it can come . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So it doesn't actually have buttons . "
D,Minor,"So that uh then what we look t "
A,Elicit,"Did you wanna see ? "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah no "
B,Task,"you can carry on comm "
D,Task,"This is a model comm "
D,Elicit,"yeah . "
B,Task,"I just look how it feels all . "
B,Task,"Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Just I'm "
C,Task,"Yeah actually comm yeah . "
B,Other,"I really want to talk to it . "
B,Minor,"But . "
A,Other,"It won't talk back . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"but but continue with your uh "
D,Minor,"Uh so well "
B,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"then the this is the a more a little uh smooth "
D,Task,"and it gives a lot of functionality comm uh in this way comm "
D,Minor,"so all we have "
D,Task,"uh th you see there are only six keys comm "
D,Task,"but don't worry "
D,Task,"they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . "
A,Other,"Right . "
B,Other,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And so they have more space actually "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and uh it's easy to uh use this "
D,Minor,"and uh you have "
D,Minor,"um so "
D,Task,"this is a standard uh uh infrared eye comm "
D,Task,"and then you have a power button comm which l volume comm what you have comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo "
C,Task,"Play comm pause . "
D,Task,"yeah s pause or stop comm "
D,Minor,"and uh then uh you can uh "
D,Task,"you have a L_C_D_ display comm here "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and uh y this is a functional thing "
D,Minor,"which can change "
D,Minor,"like "
D,Task,"it's a toggle switch "
D,Task,"which could change the function "
D,Minor,"say comm y you press it "
B,Elicit,"From D_V_D_ player to television or something . "
D,Task,"Yeah . I really can change it comm "
C,Task,"Exactly yeah . To audio and to video on demand . "
B,Other,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Instead of having many switches comm y "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yes "
B,Task,"and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ "
B,Elicit,"yeah . "
D,Task,"The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that comm "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"and uh well "
D,Task,"you can have a integrated microphone over here comm "
C,Task,"This is the orange button comm the microphone . "
D,Task,"or in the button th here comm "
D,Minor,"so which can "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"uh basically "
D,Task,"you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . "
C,Minor,"An "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"And here is a small L_E_D_ "
D,Task,"which is like blinking one comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery comm "
D,Task,"and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"okay . And uh well "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"then we have a cover "
D,Minor,"basically comm basically "
D,Task,"you don't need much of the time this comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"when you need you can use it comm "
D,Task,"and this gives additional functionality "
D,Task,"that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover "
B,Minor,"Mm . Yeah "
C,Task,"Crazy dis designer comm "
D,Minor,"you know . "
C,Task,"okay . "
D,Minor,"Design enter . "
B,Elicit,"but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed comm will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . It's basically to do that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature "
B,Task,"which shouldn't be shouldn't be "
D,Task,"Actually when you are watching the T_V_ comm when you are watching anything or listening to them comm you hardly care about what is getting displayed here comm "
C,Minor,"Oh actually well . "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Minor,"uh you want to uh "
B,Task,"That th that's true . "
D,Task,"and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually comm giving a cover to that actually . Gives a protection "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yes . Yes comm "
B,Task,"more robust . "
D,Task,"it's more robust that way . Uh yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"And you have very good chances "
C,Task,"It's low weight . You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So the the cost is actually a bit more comm "
C,Task,"it's uh it's it's sixteen Francs . "
D,Minor,"It "
D,Task,"Sixteen Euros . "
C,Task,"Sixteen Euros "
C,Other,"sorry . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So it's well outside the budget then . "
C,Task,"Then it's out of budget . "
C,Task,"But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . "
B,Minor,"But w "
C,Task,"And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Three Euros . "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"three Euros "
C,Other,"sorry . "
C,Minor,"And um "
A,Elicit,"That's on top of the sixteen comm "
A,Elicit,"or is it part of that ? "
C,Task,"No no no comm "
C,Task,"part of that comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Part of that . "
A,Task,"So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm 'kay . Hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Well uh "
D,Minor,"if you we can have "
D,Task,"if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys "
D,Minor,"if you want to "
D,Minor,"you know "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"I think th th "
C,Minor,"yeah "
C,Task,"we should stick with uh a number of keys "
A,Task,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"because if we add too much then "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"it it should not be cluttering up everything . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"it's too "
A,Elicit,"What's this one on the side ? "
D,Minor,"Ah "
D,Minor,"that's for the "
D,Task,"it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery "
C,Task,"Locati . Location . "
A,Other,"Ah okay . "
D,Task,"and as well as it's like a blinking one "
D,Minor,"you know "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . "
D,Task,"you can keep it aside . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I like the shape of them comm "
A,Task,"I do like the the size and the the shape . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well well Mm . "
B,Task,"Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible comm maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
A,Task,"And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products comm both of these two . "
B,Task,"Yes . Evalua evaluation "
B,Task,"and also the evaluation criteria comm so what what is important to look at . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Basically this is what we've talked about already comm um comm from the marketing point of view . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"just do it quickly "
A,Other,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"if if we al already . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um we just go through these "
A,Task,"and rate them as a group "
A,Task,"and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that comm "
A,Task,"so just average the score of those items comm "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"These are the things we identified as being important . "
A,Task,"Um the three things were look and feel comm innovation and ease of use comm were the three important components "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . "
A,Task,"And then goin following the company motto comm following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . "
A,Minor,"So well "
A,Elicit,"do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now "
A,Elicit,"or do we wanna discuss them further "
A,Elicit,"and then evaluate them ? "
B,Task,"Um comm n no "
B,Task,"why not why not discuss uh discuss it now comm "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"f "
A,Other,"just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . "
A,Task,"Not sure how this is gonna come out . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"the first one was really very far below budget comm "
A,Elicit,"would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that "
A,Elicit,"or just have the high profit on it ? "
A,Minor,"'Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a "
B,Minor,"Mm comm well "
B,Task,"my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"And then I mean w w w you must just see it "
B,Task,"we can still spend this four and a half Euro "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"and to r "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro . "
C,Task,"Functionality . "
A,Minor,"Okay so "
A,Task,"look and feel comm innovation "
D,Task,"And now it easy to use . "
C,Task,"Easy to use . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"target . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And trends . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Elicit,"you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? "
A,Elicit,"Is that part of both of them or ? "
B,Minor,"Um well "
B,Task,"w w we can still discuss that . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So um comm "
B,Task,"and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas "
B,Task,"I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"because they are too expensive comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"um I've received uh a framework which we can do this . "
B,Elicit,"I mean did you have this this Excel sheet ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Other,"No okay comm "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components comm "
B,Task,"so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"maybe we can start with this comm "
B,Task,"uh comm calling this one . "
A,Task,"Okay . Yep . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"it's the pink . "
B,Task,"Th th this is the first design . "
A,Task,"And the other one's green . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Elicit,"look and feel ? "
A,Minor,"Where um one is "
A,Task,"I've broken the pen again . "
B,Task,"Uh there is another pen . "
A,Minor,"S "
A,Other,"yeah . "
A,Other,"Get that one . "
A,Task,"Um w one's bad "
A,Task,"and seven's the best . "
A,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Task,"one's true "
A,Task,"and seven's false . "
A,Task,"One's the best . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"So on a scale of one to seven ? "
B,Task,"'Kay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . So . "
B,Elicit,"Look and feel . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Other,"you already feel that uh pretty much I think . "
B,Task,"In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good comm is very good in your hand comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm yeah . "
B,Task,"so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"But that's just half comm "
B,Task,"we should also consider look comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and then i it looks quite conventional . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"Don't you agree ? "
D,Task,"Mm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at comm "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"maybe two . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . Hmm . "
B,Task,"Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five "
A,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"It's my opinion comm "
B,Minor,"but I don't know what what "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"I will give it maybe we have anyways "
D,Task,"the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"you know . "
D,Minor,"It "
D,Task,"though the look is fine "
D,Task,"but uh still I will give four in that case "
C,Task,"Yeah . Four maybe . "
D,Elicit,"you know . "
A,Other,"Four ? "
D,Task,"Four yeah "
B,Task,"Four comm four . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Now we th th "
D,Minor,"that "
B,Task,"then we settle on four . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I will gi "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Elicit,"Can you maybe fix the other "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"If you press like this not like this "
C,Minor,"then you "
A,Task,"No "
A,Minor,"that's the "
D,Task,"No . "
D,Elicit,"C can you get the batteries ? "
A,Task,"ink's dried . "
D,Task,"No no "
D,Task,"the battery has fallen down comm "
A,Task,"Battery's low comm "
D,Minor,"that's i "
A,Elicit,"isn't it the ink ? "
A,Minor,"The b "
A,Elicit,"that's the that that one ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"battery there . "
C,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"No no it's not that comm "
D,Task,"it's how to close a battery . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Okay ? "
D,Minor,"Now it should be . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"I think it's lost a battery . "
B,Task,"Mm comm try it comm just try it . "
A,Task,"No "
A,Minor,"it's "
B,Other,"Oh it will not "
A,Task,"It would still write "
B,Minor,"ri "
A,Task,"but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors . "
B,Task,"mm comm "
B,Task,"mm . "
D,Elicit,"Is there another battery there ? "
D,Task,"Oh yeah . "
A,Elicit,"You got a second ? "
C,Task,"Try a "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"we won't be able to tell . "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Minor,"it it has a mm . "
C,Task,"Perfect . "
A,Elicit,"Is that working ? "
A,Elicit,"Did it come out ? "
A,Task,"Good . Okay . "
B,Task,"Good . Good . "
A,Task,"Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working comm "
A,Task,"it's just a normal whiteboard marker "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard . "
C,Other,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Okay . So "
B,Minor,"then then "
A,Elicit,"And the other one ? "
C,Task,"Wow . "
B,Task,"Ah . "
A,Task,"I think it's slightly better comm um comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"it's hard to tell from just the plasticine comm "
B,Minor,"I I I "
A,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"When we want to include I I "
B,Task,"I'm doubting about this this component . "
B,Task,"It it it it breaks "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"in your "
C,Minor,"'Kay "
C,Minor,"maybe "
D,Task,"No "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"actually this is this is not going to protrude actually comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"it it's n i it is jus "
C,Task,"It's not a button "
C,Task,"it's a led comm "
C,Minor,"it's a "
D,Task,"It's a led actually "
D,Task,"which which 'll be covering in a curve "
C,Task,"Ac actually yeah it should be embedded . "
B,Other,"Mm comm yes I see comm mm okay . "
D,Task,"It's will be embedded there "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Oh "
D,Task,"so it won't be really you know protruding or something . "
C,Task,"you can push push it again comm you can push it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"The other thing is comm is the left hand one protruding ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"maybe it won't work so well . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"No you it it not protruding actually comm "
D,Task,"it will go in better into that "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"r r "
A,Task,"I'd say two or three for that one comm personally . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Probably more towards three than two . "
B,Task,"I think the look is better "
B,Task,"but the feel is is is worse . "
B,Task,"So so I would also say this is four . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"But w w do you what do you think ? "
D,Task,"Uh it's fine I think . "
D,Minor,"My just that um the feel is that um you "
D,Task,"right now you you don't see the feel "
D,Task,"because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this comm now it's embedded one . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Mm . Mm . Yes . "
D,Minor,"This is how embedded one will "
B,Minor,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"it basically is the same shape . "
D,Task,"Yeah . It's a bas basically the same thing actually . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm . "
D,Minor,"You will be Except that in this c "
C,Task,"And the L_C_D_ makes it better . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"And you might have a slight thing for to forward and "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm comm okay . "
C,Task,"So I will say two . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes comm okay . "
C,Task,"I would say two comm three . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Elicit,"consensus ? "
A,Elicit,"Two or three ? "
B,Task,"Two ? "
B,Task,"Mm . Two's good "
A,Other,"Two ? "
C,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"yes . "
D,Minor,"looking like "
A,Minor,"Um comm 'kay . "
A,Elicit,"Innovation . "
A,Minor,"The first one comm not really muc "
C,Task,"Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Task,"No but except for the design of the surf . "
A,Minor,"Do we "
C,Task,"Yeah . The surf uh design . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"What What features are we actually including ? "
D,Minor,"You should be rea "
A,Elicit,"Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? "
D,Task,"Uh no "
D,Task,"I think it's more of the feel . "
A,Elicit,"There's nothing like that ? "
A,Task,"But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all comm "
A,Task,"it's just a straight-out remote control . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"The only innova innovation is the shape . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Say about that . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"S so that "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"there's no "
A,Task,"this uh look and feel thing comm though that's not a technological innovation . "
C,Task,"Yeah . You're right . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So I'd be up for seven for innovation . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And the And the second one is really uh state of the art comm uh in terms of innovation . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"And um with many more functionalities comm "
C,Task,"and can open and close the the bottom part . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"it gives it "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"A and the L_C_D_ screen is "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's that's that's well it's quite innovative . "
C,Task,"And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Uh could put it at one or two I would say . Personally . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
A,Elicit,"So what is it comm what are the innovations with this ? "
A,Task,"Got the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Minor,"Uh Yeah "
C,Task,"automatic speech recognition . "
A,Elicit,"Is that in this one though ? "
A,Minor,"Is this 'cause this is the "
D,Other,"No comm "
A,Task,"Th th there were different options we discussed then comm "
D,Minor,"we ha "
A,Task,"we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . "
B,Task,"We just diske discuss it as you designed it "
B,Task,"and then we will will try to get it in the budget . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So the cost for these were "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"what was the cost for the first one ? Eight Euros ? "
B,Task,"Eight . "
C,Task,"Eight . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"actually we have yeah to check again yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm eight Euros yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And this one was sixteen Euros . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Sixteen . "
D,Task,"Sixteen Euros . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So . "
A,Elicit,"Innovation for this one is two ? One ? "
D,Task,"It's a two comm I would say two . "
A,Other,"Two ? "
C,Elicit,"W W un to be one what would do we nee actually comm "
B,Task,"Two . "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I don't see "
B,Task,"Why it is one . "
C,Minor,"okay comm "
C,Task,"one would would be without buttons comm . "
B,Minor,"A man w w "
A,Minor,"Mm . Well "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it comm "
C,Minor,"Bu "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"So maybe we can put one . "
B,Elicit,"This this is it w with the speech recognition ? "
C,Task,"It's using speech recognition comm yeah . "
D,Other,"Okay yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well . "
B,Task,"Gi given that that it works comm "
A,Elicit,"Give it a one ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm one comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"then it's I think one . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Ease of use ? "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"the first one is really standard comm "
C,Task,"so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"He is used to it act "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Task,"They are used to it actually . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"So that's maybe a a two for ease of use . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Here there may "
C,Task,"Um comm the other one is quite easy comm tho though . "
D,Task,"Uh comm though it has more functionality "
D,Task,"I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . It shouldn't be diffi "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"So maybe a three or a four . "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah comm "
D,Minor,"actually in fact I think it will be "
C,Minor,"One me um we hope "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"but y "
C,Minor,"And there is a "
C,Minor,"like "
C,Task,"I would say three . Or maybe four . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Well "
A,Elicit,"Consensus ? Three or four ? "
D,Task,"we have reduced the keys actually you see . "
B,Task,"Three comm I would . Three . "
D,Task,"Three is fine with me . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah "
A,Other,"Three ? Okay . "
C,Task,"because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"it's a "
D,Task,"actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually comm "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"it's not so easy comm like this one the normal . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes "
B,Task,"but then when when he is used to it comm i i it is quite easy . "
D,Task,"Is quite easy yeah . "
B,Task,"So so I think th three is good . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Initially there there is a lot of effort comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Good . "
B,Elicit,"What's the next ? "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"three's "
A,Elicit,"uh how well it goes to the target demographic . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? "
B,Task,"Twe twenty to forty comm yes that's "
A,Minor,"That's "
C,Task,"This one would be uh for grandmothers . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"no comm "
D,Minor,"this would I "
D,Task,"I would I would give this model to the old people actually . "
C,Other,"No . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm grandmothers comm "
C,Elicit,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So sh completely changed our demographic there comm "
D,Minor,"And "
A,Task,"it's not part of the the funky young thing . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think comm "
C,Task,"Yeah that's true . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being applying to the the demographic "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"That's it's still Ye "
B,Task,"Mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance comm making this more attractive to to the demographic "
A,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"'Cause we have got room comm we've got some budget there to add a few things to it comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"that's right . "
B,Task,"But as it is now comm I w would say mm comm six comm something . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Other,"yeah comm . "
B,Elicit,"Do you agree ? "
A,Minor,"And "
D,Minor,"I "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"I think "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important comm the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets comm the right range of people comm "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Uh yeah "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap comm actually . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"But w "
A,Task,"But it's going to be cheap whatever though comm "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"it was set with i "
A,Task,"we've got a set price . "
D,Task,"And people can still decide to use the cheaper one "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"instead of a "
C,Minor,"But for us it's "
C,Minor,"yeah "
C,Task,"we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros . "
B,Task,"Mm comm yeah comm indeed . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Ju just think comm twenty five Euros comm "
B,Task,"I mean it's not going to be cheaper . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So in that case well it's fine then . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"We can "
B,Minor,"Mm . Mm . Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? "
D,Other,"And the demographics of "
A,Task,"It's got the got the the toys in it comm "
A,Task,"it's got the L_C_D_ screen "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"tha tha tha tha tha that's "
A,Minor,"and "
B,Task,"I think it's better comm "
B,Task,"because of the L_C_D_ screen "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"which is really an appeal on the on the on the "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"on the and on the "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And if you want to target "
C,Minor,"yeah "
C,Task,"if we we wish to to sell four millions of this comm I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . So comm "
B,Task,"the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"yes . "
B,Minor,"Because it "
A,Task,"I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm comm ma maybe that's something to consider comm yes comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . Okay . "
B,Minor,"so . "
B,Minor,"Wh what what "
A,Task,"I'd probably go with three again for that one . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"I think it's uh it has more market actually . "
C,Task,"Or even Even one and two . Or two . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Y yeah comm you know "
B,Minor,"No "
B,Task,"s say t two . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"two . "
A,Elicit,"So comm two comm yeah ? "
B,Elicit,"Two ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . Two yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah two yeah . "
D,Task,"Because tomorrow this will be more appealing "
D,Task,"because you can add lot of sophistication on that . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"for the people to "
A,Task,"And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well comm "
A,Task,"and that makes it more appealing comm "
A,Task,"it's more of a a new fun toy . "
D,Task,"We have to practically test it . "
D,Task,"The field test will tell you how good . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"the final point comm trends . "
A,Elicit,"And following the trends . "
D,Task,"The trends . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"as it is comm not really doing either of them . "
B,Minor,"I think "
C,Elicit,"Spongy comm uh comm that means that it goes in in the water . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well comm "
A,Minor,"I know some "
A,Elicit,"have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons "
A,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"not not exactly spongy "
A,Task,"but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons "
C,Other,"Uh okay . "
A,Task,"it's got just a one bit on it "
B,Other,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Yeah I know . "
A,Minor,"and so you can "
A,Task,"that feels kinda spongy . "
C,Elicit,"But this one includes this feature comm right ? Spongy buttons . "
D,Task,"Yeah . We we we we we yeah comm it's the way they are going to be comm actually . "
A,Task,"So it's sort of comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Mm . Okay . "
C,Minor,"So Uh "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . "
A,Task,"But that's if you're using the covers . "
B,Minor,"And the then we can al "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Or is it just one "
B,Task,"yes . "
B,Minor,"We can we can consider "
B,Elicit,"uh uh is it possible do you think comm to to make a cover for s such a phone ? "
B,Minor,"I mean "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"they make it for mobiles comm "
A,Task,"it can't be that much more complicated . "
D,Elicit,"But why do you want to cover that actually ? "
D,Minor,"In that uh w in the mod "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"just with the with the flexible plastic uh "
A,Task,"So you got the option of having different colours or different textures . "
C,Task,"Yeah . This is possible . "
B,Minor,"I th I th I think "
D,Elicit,"Uh uh y are you sure ? "
D,Task,"Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone comm yeah . "
B,Task,"O o or just two things which can be put on each other . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"exactly like Nokia phones . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yes comm exactly like it . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm so "
B,Minor,"Maybe we can "
B,Task,"but we have to decide it comm "
B,Task,"we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance comm to to these covers "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and s now try to invest in the in in the features . "
A,Task,"I think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics comm "
A,Task,"it lets people have the latest fashion "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out comm you'll still be able to put a new cover on it "
B,Minor,"Mm mm mm mm mm . "
A,Task,"and then it'll still be in fashion . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"'Cause sometimes "
C,Task,"look at this computer comm th this laptop comm it's all black comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and uh it's quite conventional comm "
C,Task,"and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one comm very standard one comm that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
A,Task,"And then you have the option of having the different colours comm different covers . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"So so so that that would make the trends equal comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"so we we we really have don't have comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . There's n "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them . "
B,Minor,"I mean "
A,Task,"Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Yes comm indeed . "
C,Task,"so a a point better for the for the number two . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So . "
A,Elicit,"Two and three comm "
A,Elicit,"or one and two ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it's one . "
B,Task,"Say comm say one and two . One and two . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Other,"le le let's see . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"d "
B,Elicit,"this one has spongy but buttons ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"it says a "
C,Task,"Yeah comm the blue one uh spongy . "
B,Other,"Mm comm I see comm yes okay . Good . "
A,Minor,"Okay so "
A,Elicit,"the average of that is three six nine divided by five comm so five mm nine by five comm one point s eight ? "
B,Task,"Just add it . "
C,Task,"Nine . "
B,Minor,"You know . "
D,Task,"One point six comm "
B,Task,"Three comm six comm seven . "
D,Minor,"one point "
D,Task,"One point eight yeah . "
A,Task,"This one comm eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one comm divided by five is four point two "
D,Task,"Four point Uh four point two . "
A,Task,"yep . "
C,Task,"Very good . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"But we still got a very different price for those two "
A,Task,"so they're not really comparable yet anyway . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"We we must try to get them closer . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's right comm yeah that's right . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Both in i i "
D,Other,"Wow . "
B,Task,"or we just have to choose . And adapt . "
B,Task,"Because comm when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . "
A,Task,"That'll basically take us down to the budget . "
B,Minor,"Yes comm well "
B,Minor,"But I'm "
B,Minor,"now "
B,Elicit,"did y did you work with the same prices that I have here ? "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer "
C,Task,"uh and uh I explained them "
C,Task,"and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip comm uh Matthew comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Yep . "
B,Minor,"Mm comm "
C,Task,"so maybe we have to recap with this one . "
B,Minor,"tha "
D,Task,"Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well yes comm well uh "
B,Other,"re reconsider it . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"uh what kind of energy source uh "
B,Minor,"I I "
B,Task,"we didn't speak about that . "
B,Elicit,"It's a it's a normal battery comm or "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"it migh It "
D,Task,"it'll need uh more than a conventional one comm "
D,Minor,"it won't be uh just "
D,Task,"maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . "
D,Elicit,"What do you say comm Mael ? "
C,Task,"For this one it's a normal battery . "
B,Other,"Yes . Just so one battery . 'Kay . "
B,Task,"Electronics . "
B,Task,"given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh sample speaker comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yes comm "
B,Task,"or sample sensor comm yes . "
C,Task,"Sample comm yeah comm this one . "
B,Other,"Yes comm this one . Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Case ? "
B,Minor,"Um comm "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Curved . Double curved "
D,Task,"yeah right . "
D,Minor,"It's uh "
B,Minor,"I see I "
B,Elicit,"Double curve . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"it's gonna be more than just the biggest case comm definitely . "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"which one are we talking to ? "
D,Elicit,"Are you talking about this or that ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"Either of them . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Minor,"yes comm we are talking about comm "
D,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but they have the same shape comm "
B,Minor,"but comm actually bu "
A,Task,"Mm . They're both going to be not basic cases . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"th th this would be double curves ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"'Kay . "
B,Elicit,"Uh comm plastic would be the material . "
A,Task,"Yeah . The basic one comm yep . "
C,Task,"Is it zero Franc ? "
D,Elicit,"A special colour ? "
B,Task,"Uh special colour comm now we leave it to the covers . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"now we're either going button or L_C_D_s comm L_C_D_ display . "
B,Minor,"Push . "
B,Task,"Mm comm yes comm "
B,Minor,"but "
C,Minor,"L_C_D_ is . "
C,Task,"It's okay . Just say L_C_D_ . "
A,Elicit,"Is that price per unit comm or for the whole thing ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"Ah good . "
B,Minor,"th "
B,Task,"now this is per per unit comm this number of components . "
A,Task,"So it would need twelve buttons . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"we might need a scroll wheel comm right comm for that ? "
C,Task,"No "
C,Task,"but for this one it's twelve Euro . "
D,Task,"No comm for that one also . "
C,Elicit,"There are twelve ? "
B,Minor,"So comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"that's a scroll . "
B,Other,"one comm two comm three comm four comm five comm six comm seven comm eight comm nine comm "
B,Minor,"t "
B,Task,"Yes . Twelve I believe . "
B,Task,"So this comes to eighteen . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And that's without any special button supplements . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"one scroll wheel you might need . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we'd have a special colour comm special form and special material on all of them . "
A,Task,"They're not just standard buttons . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"I think but th do you agree th that thi "
C,Task,"Wait a minute comm "
C,Task,"it's not it's not double curved comm "
C,Task,"it's single curved comm "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Minor,"Because it's there is no like . "
B,Minor,"Yes I "
A,Minor,"But I thought it would be curved on two "
A,Task,"it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well comm that's what I thought . "
B,Minor,"Yes "
B,Task,"I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"it's "
B,Other,"Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean comm yes . "
C,Minor,"you know "
C,Minor,"this curve like this so comm it's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are "
A,Elicit,"You talking about concave curves ? "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"yeah concave . "
C,Minor,"So I think we can put um "
B,Other,"Both . "
A,Elicit,"You think a single curved ? "
C,Task,"the single curved in the sixteen . "
C,Task,"That makes uh seventeen . "
C,Minor,"And what are just "
C,Elicit,"The bt buttons comm we have twelve buttons comm are you sure ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yes . Uh "
A,Task,"We have more comm "
A,Task,"we've got those the scroll wheel on the side "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"I had a bad uh bad estimation . "
A,Minor,"and yeah "
D,Task,"Bad estimate comm "
B,Minor,"W d "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Minor,"The sc "
B,Task,"we have we haven't talk about a comm "
B,Task,"but that's no a is very exp inexpensive I believe "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"but it is not in the list . "
A,Task,"We've got a scroll wheel for the volume "
A,Elicit,"don't we comm "
A,Elicit,"or is it some other thing that's not on there . "
B,Minor,"W ho h "
B,Elicit,"is this a scroll wheel "
B,Elicit,"or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ? "
C,Task,"No no no . "
A,Minor,"'Kay "
A,Task,"we've only got five minutes left guys "
A,Task,"so we need to wrap it up pretty fast . "
C,Task,"Yes comm a kind of scroll wheel . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"this is even more than the um than the cost you gave comm the sixteen Euros . "
B,Task,"Mm . Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"so based on that comm "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"um where is the es okay sample speaker "
D,Task,"That is the sample sensor and sample speaker . "
B,Minor,"So um "
C,Minor,"But still comm yeah it "
D,Task,"We just need that actually . We need one . "
B,Minor,"We're "
B,Task,"We We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip comm "
B,Task,"but then we can't have the the speech recognition comm "
B,Elicit,"yes ? Yes ? "
C,Task,"No we cannot comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"So so "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"S "
B,Minor,"w when we w a "
C,Minor,"But the um "
B,Task,"this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"but if you have the near the L_C_D_ you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio comm T_V_ and V_C_R_ comm "
C,Task,"and this needs a needs a advanced chip . "
B,Minor,"Transti "
C,Elicit,"Right comm Matthew ? "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Minor,"I i it "
C,Elicit,"Or regular chip ? "
D,Minor,"I think it's going to be y y "
C,Task,"I think yeah regular comm today we you can do that with regular chip . "
D,Task,"yeah it's th with the regular chip comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Say say it's regular comm regular chip comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . Okay . Okay . "
B,Task,"and we still on fifteen comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"so "
C,Minor,"So . "
C,Elicit,"And what about the number of buttons buttons uh my Matthew ? "
B,Task,"Yes but that maybe "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"we can just say "
D,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"one . "
C,Minor,"When you look at this w comm this u uh item comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Ca l we are just "
C,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . "
B,Elicit,"So is it possible ? "
A,Task,"But that's seven basic buttons right comm seven buttons without any adds-on comm without special colours or form or material . "
D,Minor,"That'll be "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times . "
C,Elicit,"You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really really low comm "
B,Task,"No no comm "
B,Minor,"he he he I I "
A,Minor,"Well "
C,Other,"no ? "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs comm sorry three Euros comm by itself . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And uh we don't want to to change that "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"We we really want a L_C_D_ "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this . "
C,Task,"It's evident . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"And I dunno "
A,Task,"twelve Euro fifty comm we got two off of the battery comm "
A,Task,"we can't do anything about that comm "
A,Task,"so ten fifty comm "
A,Task,"if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display comm that's seven fifty "
A,Task,"um comm so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . And the chip . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"Sorry "
A,Task,"the chip's up there already . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget comm "
A,Task,"there's no doubt about that . "
B,Minor,"A "
C,Elicit,"So wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the L_C_D_ comm um "
C,Elicit,"Do you think it's important ? "
D,Task,"Or we could even replace them by buttons actually . "
C,Task,"Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact comm you have a big display "
C,Elicit,"and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? "
C,Task,"I dunno comm "
C,Task,"I'm just asking . "
D,Task,"A actually it depends comm it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it comm "
B,Minor,"Mm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons comm "
D,Task,"or and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think comm unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display . "
D,Task,"Okay so we can get rid of it "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's true yeah . "
D,Task,"and then add a couple of buttons . "
C,Elicit,"But uh comm do we want that ? "
C,Elicit,"On the market point of view comm yeah . What do you think uh comm L_C_D_ is a major feature comm or ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . I "
A,Minor,"For the price comm "
A,Task,"it's gonna be what we can afford comm "
A,Task,"and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display comm there's no way we can get it in there . "
B,Task,"I think we have to come to a decision now comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"You assume comm you want a democratic voyt vote comm "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yes . Yes . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"One man one vote . "
B,Elicit,"S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ? "
A,Task,"I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . I can't see it fitting in . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Mm-hmm mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"I think but "
C,Task,"We need to be . "
A,Task,"Bu y you're a power voter "
A,Task,"uh veto anyway as Project Manager . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm comm I know comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . . "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Elicit,"but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . "
A,Minor,"well "
A,Task,"we have to make a decision now comm that's it . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"So uh uh "
B,Task,"having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . "
B,Elicit,"Is that acceptable ? "
B,Minor,"Ca can I have can the functions be implement in an "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Elicit,"You've you you agree . "
D,Minor,"W I I I just "
B,Task,"So hav hav having seven buttons comm instead of twelve . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons . "
C,Minor,"Because one "
C,Minor,"yeah "
C,Minor,"th "
C,Task,"show me that "
C,Task,"uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons "
C,Task,"and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . Here one comm at the middle comm and at the bottom . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Mm . I think then we we're really losing ease of use . "
C,Task,"Okay comm . "
D,Task,"That will create another problem . For the people to use it . "
D,Task,"It's not going to be easy . Doing that . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm . So um "
B,Task,"I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's that's my opinion . "
D,Minor,"No comm "
D,Task,"it's okay comm you uh cut the L_C_D_ screen "
B,Minor,"Just "
D,Task,"and introduce two more buttons . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
A,Task,"L_C_D_'s out comm "
A,Elicit,"is speech rec out now ? "
A,Minor,"We've "
C,Task,"The speech recognition is out . Because of the budget comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Uh where comm L_C_ "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Okay "
B,Minor,"w we now we can just uh "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"are we basically back to the original one now comm back to the first version ? "
A,Task,"Which turns out to be on budget exactly comm pretty much . With these new costings . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"just look at "
A,Elicit,"forget that one and look at that one now . "
B,Task,"Yes . Yes . I th I th I think w we just go for this one "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Well "
B,Task,"My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected . "
A,Minor,"that's that's "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Actually yeah comm "
C,Task,"we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yep . So "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe "
A,Task,"and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in "
A,Task,"but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Other,"good . "
B,Minor,"Then we the same . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"That was it . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"That's it . "
C,Other,"Thanks . "
D,Other,"Cool . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
