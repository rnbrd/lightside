A,Minor,"Uh 'kay . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"So so so . "
B,Task,"Put on your mic . "
C,Elicit,"So you forgot how this works again ? "
B,Other,"Boss . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Other,"Boss . "
D,Task,"Maybe . Maybe maybe maybe . "
A,Task,"Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product comm "
A,Elicit,"'kay ? "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"And here's the agenda for this meeting . "
A,Other,"Uh I'm just gonna open comm say a few boring words to start with again comm and start taking minutes afterwards . "
A,Task,"You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product "
A,Task,"that I can see some demonstrations of over there . "
A,Task,"Looks cool . "
A,Task,"And then we're gonna evaluate it . "
A,Task,"Then we're gonna talk about finance comm "
D,Other,"Bra "
A,Task,"and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this . "
A,Minor,"And uh "
C,Elicit,"Hmm you knocked it up ? "
A,Task,"yep . "
A,Task,"And we're gonna evaluate the product and close . "
A,Task,"Got forty minutes to do this in . "
A,Task,"We should be fine . "
A,Task,"Let's try and keep this one on schedule . "
B,Task,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"Your thing is in where is it ? "
C,Task,"Thi third third third . "
A,Minor,"Is it in "
B,Task,"Three comm three . "
C,Task,"The end product thingy . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Who wants it ? "
B,Task,"Pedro can have it . "
B,Minor,"I like "
C,Minor,". "
B,Other,"I'll help talk . "
C,Task,"Um yeah so what we ended up with . "
C,Task,"Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department comm which is us comm is uh fifteen point eight Euros comm "
C,Task,"someone forgot the units there "
B,Task,"Unit price . "
C,Task,"yeah comm uh unit price "
C,Task,"unit production price cost thing . Um "
C,Task,"we implemented the basic functions comm "
C,Task,"which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator comm "
C,Task,"which was one of the marketing things comm "
C,Task,"cradle comm "
C,Task,"scroll wheel for uh the the channels comm "
C,Task,"and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping comm your favourite channels functionality comm in the scroll . "
A,Other,"Zapping your favourite channels comm eh ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Scrolling through your favourites list . "
A,Task,"Oh okay okay . "
C,Task,"Zapping you know zapping . "
A,Task,"Ah 'kay okay comm that's favourites . "
C,Task,"Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing . "
C,Task,"And um yeah that was the result . "
A,Task,"Ah 'kay . "
A,Task,"I like the the the the logo on there as well . "
B,Task,"It's very prominent . "
A,Task,"It is very prominent . "
A,Minor,"So this is the "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Other,"here I'll give you the "
B,Task,"so this is the cradle unit comm "
B,Task,"and this is the actual remote itself . "
B,Task,"Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here comm "
B,Task,"um and then the volume controls are here and here . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . "
B,Task,"This is the power button . "
B,Minor,"Uh we have our um "
B,Task,"we have the enter button "
B,Elicit,"and uh what was the other button here ? "
B,Task,"This is the teletext . "
C,Minor,"Start s the "
C,Task,"the start uh to to to "
B,Task,"The programme button comm "
C,Task,"programme yeah . "
B,Task,"yeah the programme button . "
A,Task,"Ah comm okay I see . "
B,Task,"So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . "
B,Task,"So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here comm "
B,Task,"and the red area is like a rubber covering . "
B,Task,"So you can see that when it lays like this or like this "
A,Task,"It's pretty cool . "
B,Task,"and the buttons are all gonna be rubber comm so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um "
A,Minor,"Is that "
A,Elicit,"could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? "
B,Task,"Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem comm but if you drop it "
C,Other,"Not helping . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"and it depends on if it's sliding comm "
B,Task,"but I think it's pretty ergonomic . "
B,Task,"You can feel it . "
A,Task,"Mm . Feels good . "
A,Elicit,"I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . "
B,Task,"Yeah of course . "
B,Task,"Well this is clay . "
A,Task,"Yeah it's kinda cool . "
A,Task,"You have to reach a little bit don't you . "
B,Task,"Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach comm "
B,Other,"but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . "
A,Task,"Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense . "
B,Task,"These this is a bit larger than it would be comm but "
A,Task,"It's cool . I'm impressed . "
C,Task,"Don't have no one to handle that . "
D,Minor,"Mm that's "
A,Task,"And hold it so "
A,Elicit,"wh what's the marketing perspective ? "
D,Minor,"oh that's "
D,Task,"oh I like it . "
D,Task,"I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for comm so I'm happy "
D,Task,"because we've got some really marketable features in this . "
D,Task,"Yeah I think it's good . "
D,Task,"Good good good job . "
B,Task,"Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . "
B,Other,"Beep beep beep . "
D,Minor,"Uh pla "
C,Task,"The locator function . "
D,Minor,"I'm ha "
D,Task,"It's great . That's great . It's a great feature . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Um beep beep beep "
A,Task,"Mm it's impressing . "
A,Other,"So let me get it comm "
B,Minor,"so "
A,Elicit,"if I press this button "
B,Other,"beep beep beep "
A,Task,"I see . That's pretty cool . "
C,Task,"Wicked isn't it ? "
A,Other,"Hang on . "
B,Other,"beep beep beep "
B,Other,"be shut up . "
D,Other,"So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town "
B,Other,"Beep beep beep "
B,Other,"okay . Um no no no tha that's alri "
A,Other,"I plan to do that as well . "
A,Elicit,"So the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in ? "
B,Task,"Exactly that's exactly what those are for . "
A,Task,"Ah okay okay . "
B,Task,"And um there's one other feature that we were debating comm but we decided to go against it comm "
B,Minor,"is um you could "
B,Other,"beep beep beep "
B,Task,"we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger "
A,Task,"Yeah it's the right shape isn't it ? "
B,Task,"it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there comm "
B,Task,"but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . "
B,Task,"And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so "
A,Task,"But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides . "
B,Other,"So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit comm "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Uh comm I can see that . "
A,Task,"But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"hasn't it ? "
D,Task,"Yep I like . "
D,Task,"Good job . "
A,Elicit,"So is that the the final colour scheme as well or ? "
B,Task,"Oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time . "
D,Task,"No no . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . "
A,Minor,"The hmm . "
B,Task,"Careful . "
A,Task,"It came off . "
A,Task,"The scroll wheels comm a problem with them not being sort of "
D,Minor,"Well I mean of course comm I mean "
A,Task,"I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . "
D,Task,"My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"You know some blend of silvers and blacks . "
B,Other,"Beep beep beep . "
A,Task,"Okay enough of that . "
A,Task,"Well i it's cool guys . "
A,Elicit,"'Kay so are we done with the this presentation ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Ja . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Now now . "
D,Task,"So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there "
D,Task,"I gotta do mine up at the board . "
A,Task,"Have you ? Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? "
D,Task,"No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . "
A,Task,"Oh I see I see . "
D,Task,"I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint comm "
D,Task,"and I think I've got this really strange cable . "
D,Minor,"So what I had comm basically going from the PowerPoint format comm is that "
D,Task,"uh yeah yeah I like this a lot . "
D,Elicit,"Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? "
C,Task,"Nah . "
D,Task,"So what we had is we had the method . "
D,Elicit,"That's not how you spell method comm is it ? "
B,Task,"No way . "
D,Task,"No A_ . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Task,"So this doesn't go so fast this way . "
D,Task,"And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . "
D,Task,"And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . "
D,Task,"We've got the features comm "
D,Task,"we have the uh characteristics comm "
D,Minor,"and we have the "
D,Task,"I I don't know what we would call the other part "
D,Minor,"what we call you know the the the corp corporate "
D,Elicit,"Help me . "
D,Task,"The the corporation stands behind the product comm okay . "
D,Task,"So the features I think "
D,Task,"we got the scroll comm we've got the uh the locator comm we've got the durability comm we've got the dependability comm "
C,Task,"It fell off . "
D,Task,"we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um "
B,Other,"Beep beep beep . "
D,Task,"the characteristics I talk about comm "
D,Task,"we have reliability comm we have comfort comm we have ergonomics comm we have environmentally s sensitive . "
D,Task,"Uh and the corporation comm we're talking about we're we're a new we're a new company . "
D,Task,"We're wanting to make a name for ourself . "
D,Task,"We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . "
D,Task,"One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product comm a normal use guarantee comm "
D,Task,"which means that this product comm for the for the life of of the life use comm if it should have a technical problem comm that we could re replace it at no cost ? "
D,Task,"That was something I would be interested in . "
D,Minor,"Um so yeah "
D,Task,"without uh going into great details comm we have a we have a product comm "
D,Task,"it has the features and the characteristics comm and the background comm I believe comm to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . "
D,Task,"We're gonna be competitive comm and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . "
D,Minor,"Um w "
A,Minor,"Do you "
A,Elicit,"would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could comm but lowering our profit margins ? "
D,Task,"That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate "
D,Minor,"um I I m "
D,Task,"for my evaluation comm based on what our competition is comm I th I think that that we can go after this "
D,Task,"and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Mm 'kay . "
D,Task,"But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction . "
D,Task,"But you guys came up with a great product comm "
D,Task,"and at that cost I think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . "
D,Task,"The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . "
D,Task,"Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . "
D,Task,"But with all of these other features I think people c one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . "
D,Task,"There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things comm so they keep it comm they don't take it back . "
A,Task,"And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway comm aren't we ? "
A,Task,"Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . "
D,Task,"Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? "
D,Task,"You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Elicit,"You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after "
C,Task,"W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff comm but "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
D,Elicit,"but you follow what I'm s I'm s "
C,Other,"We we w yeah "
C,Task,"we could get another version of it that actually works . "
D,Minor,"Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're "
C,Minor,"But uh "
D,Task,"yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything comm "
D,Task,"but that's that was just an idea I had . "
D,Minor,"Uh to me the only additions "
A,Task,"Yeah comm the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well comm or making it less "
A,Task,"b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons comm "
A,Task,"you know what they do comm it's very simple comm and it just works . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Mm there's a risk of that . "
D,Task,"But anyway that's uh "
A,Task,"Okay so we can talk about finance now . "
A,Task,"So I have a little spreadsheet for us "
A,Minor,"where "
A,Minor,"I I was wondering comm you "
A,Elicit,"when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros comm I was wondering how you came up with that figure ? "
B,Task,"Well comm that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units . "
A,Task,"Okay "
A,Task,"so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this . "
C,Task,"Very co very colf colourful . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Now "
A,Task,"I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros comm "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"equivalent to solar cells comm "
A,Task,"which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"Uh and I'm assuming that the locator beacon comm "
A,Task,"the you know the "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"beep beep beep . "
A,Minor,"Can be made for "
A,Task,"it sounded different that time "
A,Task,"uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display comm "
B,Other,"Oh comm sorry . "
A,Minor,"uh an uh "
A,Elicit,"Uh do you think that's fair coming from a m the manufacturing ? "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print comm we only need the uh the regular chip on print comm "
A,Minor,". "
B,Task,"so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So we're down to sixteen point four comm yeah . "
B,Task,"And we and we have a single-curved uh "
A,Elicit,"Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? "
B,Minor,"Uh I think that "
A,Task,"We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur "
D,Task,"We've got a we've got a curve and a droop . "
D,Task,"I don't know whether that . "
B,Task,"It's single-curved comm "
A,Elicit,"You think ? "
A,Task,"Okay "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"I'm convinced . "
A,Task,"But we save one Euro that way comm yeah ? "
A,Task,"So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four . "
B,Task,"See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . "
B,Task,"So yeah it's fifteen point eight comm "
B,Task,"that's where we came up with it . "
A,Other,"Well hang on . "
A,Task,"Do don't speak so "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"it's in here comm in that "
A,Minor,"w do we have any "
A,Elicit,"we have special form don't we ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah we do . "
A,Minor,"So that's yeah . "
B,Other,"Ah . What do you know . "
A,Minor,"But the the the "
A,Task,"we haven't talked about any special colour though "
A,Minor,"uh I don't th "
A,Task,"if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're "
B,Task,"Oh it's a that's not very special comm it's pretty "
A,Minor,"O okay so we're "
A,Minor,"Push-button comm scroll wheel comm we're basically we have uh th "
B,Minor,"If th . "
C,Minor,"We don't "
A,Elicit,"is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? "
C,Task,"It's a scroll . "
B,Task,"That's a scroll . "
A,Elicit,"Just a scroll ? "
A,Elicit,"It's not one of the scrolls where comm for example comm with this one you could push it down to be a button ? "
B,Task,"Uh no we just use it as a scroll . "
D,Other,"Ooh . "
A,Task,"Okay "
A,Task,"then we have fifteen point eight Euros . "
B,Task,"It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say . "
A,Task,"It wasn't bad . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Other,"We're wicked . Awesome . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay so "
A,Minor,"we're on to the "
B,Other,"S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation comm "
A,Task,"where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us comm and we can use that to tell How's it going ? "
A,Elicit,"Anyone got any thoughts ? "
B,Other,"What ? "
A,Elicit,"How how have we done today ? "
B,Task,"I think we did pretty well . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think we did pretty well too . "
A,Task,"That looks pretty spectacular . "
D,Task,"No comm I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . "
A,Elicit,"Any other chang uh thoughts ? "
A,Elicit,"Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? "
C,Minor,"That was mm-hmm "
A,Minor,"Is it the . "
B,Task,"Sh I think there was plenty of room . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I "
A,Task,"I think we we ended up being quite creative there . "
B,Minor,"We got a couple innovative i "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"well we we we kinda broke "
B,Task,"Couple innovative ideas . "
D,Task,"we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us "
D,Task,"because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"No . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"we raised the price of it comm we've added two t new technology to it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us . "
A,Task,"Not every idea necessarily comm "
C,Minor,"Basically . "
A,Task,"it's still a remote control . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh no "
A,Task,"yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess comm "
A,Minor,"but the uh "
D,Minor,"But I like "
D,Task,"I mean when I say we have we had I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it . "
A,Elicit,"'Kay leadership comm what do we report back to the bosses ? "
A,Task,"No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . "
C,Task,"It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"I agree . "
C,Task,"Teamwork . "
D,Task,"Cohesive yeah . "
A,Task,"Synergy . "
D,Task,"Yes synergistic yeah . "
B,Other,"There was a lot of synergy . "
A,Task,"Teamwork comm "
A,Minor,"yeah he is uh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"What did we think of the meeting room comm "
A,Task,"I guess is an important thing here . "
B,Task,"These cables suck . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm this falls off "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and uh the white board worked really well without any pro "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"And that's "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"D you must have very long shirts . "
C,Task,"That's way far down lapel mic . "
A,Other,"Mm-mm comm lapel . "
A,Task,"Wha okay comm oh comm alright . "
C,Task,"Lapel lapel lapel . "
B,Task,"Lapel . "
C,Other,"That's almost a crotch mi cr "
A,Task,"That's it's down comm it's quite close . "
D,Other,"You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th "
A,Other,"Keep it comm keep it calm . "
C,Other,"Oh dear oh dear . "
A,Other,"Oh dear . No more pizza for me . "
A,Task,"So yeah the the pen came in alright "
A,Task,"and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . "
C,Task,"'Cause this is you were using it o upside down . "
C,Minor,"Still that "
B,Other,"That's our boss . "
A,Task,"Nah comm I'm I'm not convinced of that at all . "
A,Task,"I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day comm "
A,Minor,"but see these look like they're "
A,Task,"that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around comm "
C,Task,"Use them like that . "
B,Task,"Pedro's right . "
A,Task,"but it feels more comfortable comm wh what you call upside-down . "
B,Task,"Pedro's right . "
A,Task,"I don't care . "
A,Task,"Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . "
A,Elicit,"What new ideas have we found ? "
B,Minor,"Oh wel "
D,Elicit,"New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or "
D,Minor,"what are we ta "
A,Task,"Well let's do both then . "
A,Elicit,"Uh for the product ? "
B,Task,"Well we had the favourites list comm and the scroll bar comm and we have the cradle comm and the r uh remote call feature . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Yeah we came up with quite a bit . "
C,Task,"Bunch of new ideas . "
A,Elicit,"And for the meeting room comm Has anyone got any more "
C,Task,"Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . "
A,Task,"Yeah less sore on the ears . "
D,Minor,"Well I I mean "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables comm "
D,Task,"but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about . "
D,Task,"And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . "
D,Task,"It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well comm "
D,Task,"but I don't think that's the "
D,Task,"that's avoidable . "
C,Task,"Coulda been worse . "
A,Minor,"Okay so "
A,Elicit,"Are the costs within the budget ? "
C,Task,"Mm n no . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Nope . "
A,Other,"Oh hang on it really "
A,Task,"that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros . "
A,Task,"No requirements are changed . "
A,Task,"We're still under twenty Euros to build comm so we're good . "
A,Elicit,"And the costs within the budget ? "
A,Task,"Not the original budget comm but they are now . "
A,Elicit,"Is the project evaluated ? "
A,Task,"Mm I think so yeah comm "
A,Task,"then celebration as it says . "
C,Other,"Hooray . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Free coke provided at the cafeteria . "
B,Other,"All right . "
A,Task,"Oh I don't know how that got there . "
A,Minor,"Uh anyway . "
C,Elicit,"Who wrote that one ? "
A,Minor,"Thank "
D,Task,"So we need to close this meeting comm "
A,Other,"Thanks guys . "
D,Task,"yeah bravo . Congratulations . "
C,Task,"Cool . "
B,Task,"Good job guys . "
D,Task,"S I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on "
D,Task,"so let's close this and come back and 'kay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
