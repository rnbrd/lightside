A,Minor,"Right uh . "
A,Minor,"So um . "
A,Elicit,"So where's the PowerPoint presentation ? "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
A,Other,"Microsoft PowerPoint comm right . "
A,Minor,"Right comm okay . So . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so we've got uh "
A,Task,"so we've got new project requirements . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"So basically we've got three things comm "
A,Task,"and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Other,"Three presentations . "
B,Minor,"We have a "
B,Task,"I guess we have a presentation each comm "
B,Task,"'cause I've got one . Um . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I've got one too . "
A,Other,"I see comm right . "
A,Task,"That's nice to know comm "
A,Task,"one from each of you . "
A,Task,"Um new project requirements . "
A,Elicit,"Um so do we want to do the presentation first comm "
A,Minor,"or do we want to um "
A,Task,"W I I got um or or three things basically comm um relating to the remote being only for T_V_ . "
A,Task,"We discussed that last time "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled in a sense . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um we've got uh teletext outdated . "
A,Elicit,"Um did you get any information on that ? "
B,Task,"Uh we didn't comm no . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing . "
B,Task,"I d I didn't personally . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"So I I got that in email form . "
A,Minor,"Um . Right okay . So "
A,Task,"I guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations . "
A,Task,"So we'll start with yourself "
B,Task,"Okay that's fine . "
A,Minor,"on the basis that uh "
B,Other,"I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one . "
A,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Task,"yep . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
C,Elicit,"What is it ? "
B,Task,"I'm not quite sure how it "
C,Task,"I think you've got to do um control F_ eight . "
B,Other,"Control "
B,Task,"Doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . "
C,Task,"Shift F_ eight . "
B,Task,"Alt function F_ eight . "
B,Task,"Again not doing anything . "
D,Task,"There's usually a little thing in the top right for the "
D,Task,"Oh hang on comm "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Ah there comm "
D,Task,"it's just coming on . "
C,Task,"it's doing something . "
B,Task,"pressed about five times now . "
B,Task,"Okay comm that's me . "
B,Task,"Okay comm um I have to go again . "
A,Elicit,"it going ? "
B,Task,"Hopefully that should be it this time . "
B,Task,"Okay comm I think we're there . "
B,Task,"That's good . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm um "
B,Task,"Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design . "
B,Task,"Um of the of the remote control . "
B,Task,"Um I've just got three sections comm "
B,Task,"first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um . "
B,Task,"And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote . "
B,Task,"Um so having researched the existing models within the market comm um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function comm actually are . "
B,Task,"And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do "
B,Task,"and how it connects with the television . "
B,Task,"Um the basic components are an energy source "
B,Task,"which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply . "
B,Task,"Whether that'll be sort of two batteries comm four batteries comm um it may vary . "
B,Task,"We then have the user interface comm which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Um the various functions used for changing channel comm uh channel up and down comm volume comm things like that . "
B,Task,"Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . "
B,Task,"And then the sender comm which um is usually comm I've found comm an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . "
B,Task,"Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system "
B,Task,"but is not actually part of the remote itself comm "
B,Task,"because that's obviously found in the television . "
B,Minor,". "
B,Task,"Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board "
B,Task,"because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working comm "
B,Other,"so . I'll just go through there . "
B,Elicit,"S um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with comm or ? "
B,Minor,"Oh I'll j "
C,Task,"I think it's that little "
A,Task,"Uh there's the rubber on the right comm I think . "
B,Task,"Oh I see . "
B,Minor,"Oh okay . "
B,Other,"I'll get rid of the bear.$ "
A,Other,"it's magic . "
B,Task,"Okay that's great . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so we start off with a um battery suppl "
B,Task,"Uh no comm "
B,Task,"a power supply "
B,Minor,"which we'd probably get "
B,Task,"it's probably gonna be the battery . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"we then have a particular button comm "
B,Minor,"which may be "
B,Task,"that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons . "
B,Task,"Um but this is how the basic system works . "
B,Minor,"Um that sends "
B,Task,"after you press that that sends the message to the chip comm "
B,Minor,"which um then sends "
B,Task,"It sort of interprets which button you've pressed "
B,Task,"and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"So that's . That's the remote in itself comm "
B,Task,"that's the components of the remote "
B,Task,"and how they work together . "
B,Task,"So this is the uh user interface . "
B,Task,"Um this is the chip itself comm "
B,Task,"which then comm and that's the that's the infra-red sender . "
B,Task,"And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver . "
B,Task,"And the sender sends a message to the receiver . "
B,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"So the the top bit's the power source comm yes ? . "
B,Task,"Ah yes comm that's the power source . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"going on to personal preferences comm I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote comm "
B,Task,"just because of the size . "
B,Task,"You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote . "
B,Task,"Um and then the sender comm "
B,Task,"and infra-red um has been used quite successfully . "
B,Task,"If the battery's on reasonable power comm they always seem to work fairly well . "
B,Task,"You don't have to be point directly at the television itself . "
A,Task,"So the battery is the in the sender . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"'Kay and that's it for the moment . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So comm now more design . "
C,Task,"Right . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Task,"Mine's not quite as complicated as all that . "
A,Task,"That's what we like to hear . "
C,Elicit,"Did I press function ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Is it control function "
C,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"ei Oh comm th there you go . "
C,Task,"Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . "
C,Task,"I'm Louisa comm the User Interface Designer comm as you know . "
C,Task,"Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set comm so that a desired function is performed . "
C,Task,"Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down comm "
C,Task,"uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . "
C,Task,"Um to change the channel comm either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . "
C,Task,"Um to switch the television on or off comm maybe a standby button . "
C,Task,"Um here are two example remotes . "
C,Task,"Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward comm rewind functions comm "
C,Task,"so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . "
C,Task,"Uh but as you can see comm the left remote is quite um quite busy looking comm quite complicated . "
C,Task,"Um whereas the right remote is much simpler comm "
C,Task,"it looks much more user friendly . "
C,Task,"Um so my personal preference would be the right remote . "
C,Task,"So comm it's got nice big buttons comm "
C,Task,"it's got a very limited number of buttons . "
C,Task,"Um they're nice comm "
C,Task,"kinda clearly labelled . "
C,Task,"Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . "
C,Task,"So it's very very user friendly comm "
C,Task,"and it's got a little splash of colour . "
C,Task,"Could maybe do with some more colour . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Well there's a couple of things there . "
A,Task,"Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . "
A,Task,"So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Elicit,"Do we get to see that ? "
C,Elicit,"Will you be presenting that in a bit ? "
A,Task,"I haven't as yet comm no . "
A,Task,"But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . "
A,Minor,"So uh I'm guessing that uh uh "
A,Task,"I notice on the bottom there it's got uh "
A,Elicit,"what's that ? "
A,Task,"A_P_O_G_E_E_ "
A,Task,"that might be the corporate colour scheme comm "
A,Task,"although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here comm the the sort of circular section comm "
B,Task,"because that seems to be for a video as well . "
B,Task,"So we could dispense with that little bit as well "
B,Task,"and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . "
C,Elicit,"What do you mean by the circular section ? "
B,Elicit,"Possibly ? "
C,Elicit,"Like all of that bottom bit ? "
B,Task,"J yeah yeah yeah j yeah "
B,Task,"just this little bit "
B,Minor,"is that "
B,Task,"I think that's still um a video remote part comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so maybe we could get rid of that as well . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And I don't really think that you need nine numbers . "
A,Minor,"Well b uh w "
C,Elicit,"I mean how often do you use seven comm eight and nine ? "
C,Task,"I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . "
A,Minor,"Well th the on the "
C,Elicit,"Like how often do you hit nine ? "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time comm "
A,Task,"and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . "
B,Task,"It's just people are used to seeing that comm "
A,Minor,"But but "
B,Task,"so if we didn't have them then they might think it's "
A,Minor,"But comm "
A,Task,"well possibly "
A,Task,"but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place comm certainly the button up and down comm "
A,Elicit,"but uh I mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? "
A,Task,"I would have thought that uh it's forever expanding "
A,Task,"and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard comm you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six "
A,Task,"and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"So I would've thought that we wouldn't comm you know comm rather "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay comm if the time of flicking from one to other comm "
A,Task,"but presumably it'll take a second "
A,Task,"'cause you have to be able to stop it . "
A,Task,"Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels "
A,Minor,"that w "
A,Task,"and then you could dispense with more otherwise . "
A,Task,"Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted . "
C,Task,"Um some remotes have kind of favourite options "
C,Task,"where if you always flick from channel one to channel six comm um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred comm you could go one to one to ten comm ten to twenty "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and that would cut down your time . "
C,Minor,"Mm . Um . "
A,Other,"Anyway . "
C,Task,"But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff comm that would be tuned to one channel comm "
C,Task,"and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . "
C,Task,"Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers "
B,Other,"Okay comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Whatever . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Okay . "
A,Task,"Limit the number of buttons comm "
A,Task,"user friendly . "
C,Task,"But I suppose nine's not really excessive . "
B,Task,"I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . "
C,Task,"I suppose it does make a good pattern . "
B,Task,"So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"Well that's true comm yeah comm "
A,Task,"you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"that that makes sense . "
B,Task,"'Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Does . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So w so what was the circular thing that you were "
C,Task,"Um I think that's just for a video comm "
C,Task,"so we wouldn't need any of that at all . "
B,Elicit,"So we could get it down to what ? "
A,Task,"If it's just for T_V_ comm which is what it is at the moment . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So we get to "
B,Elicit,"How many buttons have we got ? "
B,Task,"We've just got ten comm eleven twelve th "
B,Task,"We got fourteen that we need . I guess . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um which isn't really too many . "
B,Task,"That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"I'm I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"or was I meant to give you that information ? "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Elicit,"I'm not sure . "
D,Task,"I had I've had some market information comm "
D,Task,"but not from the company comm no . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Right comm okay comm "
A,Task,"so basically time to market seems to be important comm "
A,Task,"therefore speed of delivery . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"We've only got about another four hours left . "
C,Elicit,"Okay comm so is everyone happy with that ? "
B,Task,"Ah yes yes comm that seems good . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Right well that's the end of my presentation . "
D,Task,"'Kay . "
D,Other,"I'm gonna pull this off . "
B,Task,"I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think she said twenty seconds to um "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I'm sure we'll have by the end of today . "
D,Other,"I'll give it another go . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm there we go . "
D,Minor,"Right comm "
D,Task,"we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . "
D,Task,"And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ "
D,Elicit,"and um how do people use it ? "
D,Task,"We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . "
D,Task,"Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them comm "
D,Task,"and what improvements would would they like to remote control . "
D,Task,"And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . "
D,Task,"And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly "
D,Task,"and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control "
D,Task,"And that of all the buttons on the remote control comm the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings comm um they weren't used very often at all . "
D,Task,"People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . "
D,Task,"Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . "
D,Task,"And young people were quite receptive to this comm "
D,Task,"but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older comm people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . "
D,Task,"There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . "
D,Task,"Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls "
D,Task,"and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . "
D,Task,"And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control comm it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions comm and to find your way around it . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so "
D,Task,"My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech "
D,Task,"A design which looks high-tech comm basically . "
D,Task,"Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market comm "
D,Task,"and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power comm and also volume and that sort of thing comm as as Louisa said . "
D,Task,"Um we could maybe come up with a menu comm a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . "
D,Task,"That's worth thinking about . "
D,Task,"Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well comm "
D,Task,"because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . "
D,Task,"That that might be the market that we're we're looking for . "
D,Task,"And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room comm rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels . "
D,Task,"'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise comm "
D,Task,"so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Okay um comm "
D,Task,"and that's the end of the slide show . "
D,Task,"That's it . "
D,Other,"Cool . "
C,Minor,"Do a lot of um "
A,Elicit,"What was that last wee bit there ? "
D,Task,"Um about speech recognition ? "
A,Task,"Speech recognition comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But that was only for young people that preferred it comm older people didn't . "
D,Elicit,"Youn young people pref "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility "
D,Task,"and as you go up through the age groups comm people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to comm so . "
B,Task,"No what I maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that "
B,Task,"and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . Um . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well that's right . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have "
B,Task,"You know with your mobile phone comm you lose that and you can ring it . "
B,Task,"Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So you can press a button which is always kept in one place "
B,Task,"and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else comm wherever the remote actually is . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well comm "
D,Task,"which which again would probably be a bit expensive comm but "
B,Task,"That is true comm yes . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at comm "
C,Task,"I can't remember comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and then they whistle back comm or something like that . "
A,Task,"Sounds reasonable . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That'd probably be really simple comm "
C,Task,"they're cheap . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . So "
B,Task,"So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the "
B,Task,"or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote . "
A,Task,"Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing comm you know without sound recognition . "
A,Minor,"But if you "
A,Minor,"I know . "
A,Task,"Um I was gonna say a sharp noise comm you know a clapping of hand or whatever . "
A,Task,"You'd want to try and av just have the one product "
A,Minor,"that if "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um I dunno um talking about vo "
A,Task,"I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way "
A,Task,"because it'll recognise the voice "
A,Task,"and you can give it a command comm "
A,Task,"a set command whatever that happened to be . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"you could have an option to turn it off . Or "
B,Task,"Perhaps comm um . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"So uh "
A,Minor,"Any sugges "
A,Elicit,"Well comm any conclusions ? "
D,Elicit,"Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Considering "
A,Task,"Well if it does then we can't . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's that simple comm "
A,Task,"because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me "
A,Task,"whereby we had The design logo was one comm which we've already mentioned . "
A,Task,"We've got um the remote was only for the television "
A,Minor,"and not for "
A,Task,"because that would make it too complex "
A,Task,"and we have to get it market quickly . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned comm um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So that means that uh "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So we're being focused effectively directly at a television "
A,Task,"and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"So anything that uh is to be added comm such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick "
B,Task,"Has to be simple enough to "
A,Task,"because time to market is is critical . S "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . Um . "
A,Task,"It would . "
A,Task,"But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Added extras would be nice comm "
A,Task,"but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"which effectively now is sort of four hours . "
A,Minor,"So and if "
A,Task,"and we've gotta get to the end . "
A,Task,"Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end "
A,Task,"and then get to the end with um added extras if possible . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Right okay comm uh so I need to "
A,Minor,"Right . So "
A,Task,"I don't know how long we have left of our uh time . "
A,Task,"But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions "
D,Task,"About five minutes . "
A,Task,"and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"We'll also know w when the next meeting is "
A,Task,"I um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task . "
A,Task,"And then we can report back at the next meeting "
A,Task,"and say right okay yes comm we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this comm this is how far we've progressed . "
A,Elicit,"Does that make reasonable sense ? "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"Yes that seems right . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Okay comm yeah . "
A,Task,"So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing . "
A,Task,"And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting comm if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process comm then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Do it via the email "
D,Other,"Okay . Yep . "
A,Minor,"so that rather than coming you know "
A,Task,"If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . "
A,Task,"Come along with it in the next meeting comm "
A,Task,"we can discuss it then "
A,Task,"and take whatever action is appropriate . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"But if you get it well before the next meeting comm let everybody else know "
A,Task,"'cause that might have an impact on their uh on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Right comm is there "
D,Elicit,"So do we need to decide on the functions now ? S "
A,Task,"I would guess so . "
C,Task,"Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"and "
C,Task,"'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it . "
D,Task,"Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said comm so . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that comm so . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I don't really know about the voice recognition thing . "
A,Minor,"I w well uh i "
B,Task,"Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment comm "
A,Task,"Something simple . "
B,Task,"and if something comes back "
A,Task,"Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time comm time's short comm "
A,Task,"you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"something that's quick and simple . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either comm "
A,Task,"sounds good . "
C,Task,"'cause everyone can whistle or clap comm "
C,Task,"and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology . "
A,Task,"Well comm so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range comm you want something that's easy to do comm "
A,Minor,"now something that doesn't like whis uh "
D,Task,"No not everyone can whistle comm can they comm though ? "
A,Task,"Well I I I don't know . "
A,Task,"Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine comm then go for that option comm "
A,Minor,"but if "
A,Task,"I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle comm "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"clapping comm I think clapping comm "
B,Minor,"I'd go more "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"f more for clap . "
D,Task,"yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"so uh so clap option . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button comm haven't we ? "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Elicit,"Is that one of the "
A,Task,"Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying comm "
A,Task,"that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"so so take out teletext . "
D,Other,"Taking out teletext comm okay . "
B,Elicit,"Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers "
C,Minor,"Right . "
B,Elicit,"and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think so comm "
C,Task,"so zero to nine . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so you can press any two "
D,Task,"and it'll sort of put them together . "
B,Task,"Okay comm ten numbers "
B,Task,"and then some kind of device to allow uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or multiple digits . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Did we decide anything about um the other functions ? "
B,Elicit,"As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? "
B,Elicit,"You had an had an idea about the menu ? "
D,Task,"Uh we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in comm "
D,Task,"but that again is probably an expense that "
B,Minor,"But just thinking um people probably "
B,Minor,"I mean you don't have "
B,Task,"you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once comm "
B,Task,"but you have to be able to tune it that once . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So and if finally the T_V_ breaks comm you get a new one comm you're gonna have to be able to tune it . "
B,Task,"You can't really avoid that . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So that'll be in "
A,Task,"But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"and if it is at the moment comm that's fine . "
A,Task,"But at the moment it's not comm "
A,Task,"so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters comm "
A,Task,"'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable comm or only operable in certain circumstances "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"and the idea is to have an international market "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"which is "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"And it's also m it's "
A,Task,"the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale comm "
A,Task,"so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I s I suppose um "
D,Task,"if people are buying remotes comm then they're probably buying it to replace another remote "
A,Task,"Possibly . "
D,Task,"'cause all most tellies come with remotes comm so . "
D,Task,"I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions comm "
A,Task,"That's right . "
D,Task,"so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"So how would this menu function work ? "
B,Task,"Would you maybe have like one menu button comm then you'd use the other buttons comm maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"that would be a good idea comm yeah . "
C,Task,"like the volume or something . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . "
C,Task,"My dad was watching a film the other week "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and it was too dark comm "
C,Task,"so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up . "
B,Task,"we're gonna have the the individual numbers "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"and then a menu function "
B,Task,"and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it comm to guide "
B,Minor,"Presu uh "
B,Task,"I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons "
B,Task,"you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet "
D,Task,"'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . "
B,Other,"Right comm okay um . "
D,Task,"So maybe next to each of the buttons comm you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it comm "
D,Minor,"so you're basically pressing "
B,Task,"that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two comm "
B,Task,"and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff "
B,Task,"which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it comm so . "
D,Other,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Well comm if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well comm have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down comm so there's kind of um everything else revealed ? "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So y "
C,Task,"So you don't use it that much comm "
A,Task,"Ah That's a very good idea . "
C,Task,"you don't have to see it all the time . "
C,Task,"But it's all there if you need it . "
B,Task,"That is that is a good idea actually . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Sor sort of a second . "
A,Minor,"So you keep um "
C,Task,"Like a hidden panel . "
A,Task,"Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting comm so I've been told . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"I don't know if you've got the same . "
B,Task,"Uh not quite comm but I guess . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back . "
B,Task,"Keep the other buttons but hide them away . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"And that'll be better for the older generation as well "
C,Task,"'cause comm well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu comm "
A,Minor,"Ah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . "
B,Task,"So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists comm I guess . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"data functions hidden at back . "
D,Minor,"So th the "
A,Task,"Can bring out when needed . "
D,Task,"The detailed ones would be sort of brightness comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"uh sorta "
A,Task,"That's right "
A,Minor,"so we're dis "
A,Task,"So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front "
A,Task,"and which ones are gonna be on the back . "
B,Minor,"So sh "
A,Task,"We have to decide . "
B,Task,"Should we decide in the next couple of minutes comm and then "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I guess so . "
B,Minor,"So on the "
A,Elicit,"So on front comm "
B,Task,"about the number . "
A,Task,"numbers comm "
B,Task,"Um the volume up and down . "
C,Task,"And the volume ? "
A,Task,"volume . "
B,Elicit,"Shall we have a mute button as well ? "
C,Minor,"Um . "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
B,Task,"A mute button as well . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
B,Elicit,"Or "
C,Task,"I think they're handy . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"And probably a power one as well . "
D,Minor,"Dunno . "
C,Task,"I know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here comm but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity . "
C,Elicit,"Have you seen the adverts ? "
C,Task,"Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time . "
C,Task,"Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby . "
B,Task,"But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one . "
B,Task,"'Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's maybe too much of a big issue for here . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by . "
A,Elicit,"So so are you having the stand-by on the front comm then ? "
C,Other,"Uh-oh danger sign . "
B,Task,"I think you probably should . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but a little bit smaller . "
C,Task,"Compromise . "
A,Minor,"Well . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? "
D,Task,"Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick comm so . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm so we'll have um "
C,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? "
D,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Channel up and down . "
A,Elicit,"What else have we got ? "
A,Elicit,"What was that comm sixteen ? "
D,Task,"Numbers is ten comm "
D,Task,"volume is twelve comm "
D,Minor,"th Yeah si "
A,Elicit,"Volume button . How many volumes ? "
D,Task,"One up comm one down . "
A,Task,"Right okay . "
C,Task,"On mute . "
D,Task,"And a mute comm yeah . "
D,Task,"That's sixteen isn't it comm yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Is there anything else ? "
B,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"I don't think so comm no . "
A,Task,"Power button comm stand-by comm channel comm up and down . "
A,Elicit,"So is that it ? "
C,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"That's sixteen buttons comm you reckon . "
A,Elicit,"And then at the back ? "
D,Task,"You've got brightness and contrast . "
B,Task,"Maybe if we're gonna run out of time comm one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . "
C,Minor,"And then "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So on the back it'll have brightness comm contrast comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"anything else ? "
C,Task,"Uh there's audio functions . "
A,Task,"You're also gonna have the channel tuner comm as it were . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So tuner up and down comm I guess . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Tuner comm would that have up and down ? . "
B,Task,"Um up Tune one way comm tune the o "
C,Task,"I think they normally do . "
A,Task,"okay . Okay . "
B,Task,"I I dunno I dunno possibly . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know comm saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . "
D,Task,"So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Oh yeah "
B,Task,"and th and a enter button just to select . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"Um I guess we're keeping s it simple . "
B,Task,"We don't really need any other audio funct uh functions "
B,Task,"because it's just volume up comm volume down . "
A,Task,"Um up volume comm yeah comm I would have thought so . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio comm surround sort of things . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products comm then comm "
C,Task,"Um maybe for the younger market . "
B,Elicit,"or do you have to do it via the remote ? "
C,Task,"Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . "
B,Task,"Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Oh no comm I mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them comm like on the T_V_ remote . "
B,Other,"Oh comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But I don't really know what they're for comm "
C,Task,"I've never used them . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"I just know they're something to do with Dolby . "
B,Task,"Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think "
A,Other,"Well you might get some research . "
B,Task,"Well shall we look into that and just get back together . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Other,"Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"And we'll meet back at I'm not sure . "
A,Task,"Um forty minutes comm I believe is the time . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Come on . "
