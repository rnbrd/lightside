A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"I g "
A,Other,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Time is it ? "
D,Task,"Fourteen twenty six . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Lovely to see you all again . "
A,Task,"Um it's our conceptual design meeting "
A,Task,"and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five "
A,Task,"and so we have forty minutes for this one again "
A,Task,"and so we'll go just after three o'clock . "
A,Minor,"Um okay "
A,Task,"our agenda comm "
A,Task,"we're gonna do an opening comm "
A,Task,"I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting comm "
A,Task,"then we'll have your three presentations um "
A,Task,"and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts comm "
A,Task,"and finally we'll close . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"opening . "
A,Task,"Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . "
A,Task,"We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it comm "
A,Task,"because we have international appeal "
A,Task,"and we said it's for all age groups comm different um functions of it . "
A,Task,"Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . "
A,Minor,"And s um "
A,Minor,"in "
A,Task,"specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost comm large buttons for the essential functions comm a possibility for extra functions comm like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"now three presentations . "
A,Task,"I'd like to do it in this order comm first do the conceptual specification of components comm properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . "
B,Task,"That would be me . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Alright . "
B,Other,"Well . "
A,Other,"Mm . 'kay . "
A,Task,"Function F_ eight it . "
A,Task,"There we go . "
B,Task,"Alright . "
B,Task,"Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys "
B,Task,"I uh had a lot of fun doing it . "
B,Task,"Components design . "
B,Task,"This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control "
B,Task,"and what should we make our specific remote control out of . "
B,Minor,"Um . So comm "
B,Task,"we need to examine each element separately comm "
B,Task,"but we're designing a full thing comm "
B,Task,"so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . "
B,Task,"The main elements of remote controls in general comm and therefore ours as well comm are the case comm the buttons comm the circuit board with the chip and the battery . "
B,Task,"These are all things that we had sort of addressed before comm "
B,Other,"but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here "
B,Elicit,"as we figure out what they should be made of "
B,Elicit,"and what they should look like . "
B,Task,"The case comm "
B,Task,"uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do comm "
B,Task,"um there's there's the shape of a case comm we could do a flat sh a flat case comm a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . "
B,Task,"I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet comm "
B,Task,"just keep that in mind comm "
B,Task,"but these are the options that we have from manufacturing "
B,Task,"and we can make our case out of plastic comm the m the main base will be plastic comm "
B,Task,"but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in comm wood comm latex comm titanium comm rubber or other coloured types of plastic . "
B,Task,"That would be our case . "
B,Task,"Um buttons comm "
B,Task,"for buttons we have um pushbuttons comm "
B,Task,"which is what Real Reaction uses the most often comm "
B,Task,"but we also have scror scroll wheels comm "
B,Task,"which can have integrated pushbuttons comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"or we could go all high-tech "
B,Task,"and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Task,"Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one comm a regular one or an advanced one comm "
B,Task,"depending on what our other needs are . "
B,Task,"And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . "
B,Task,"We're talking about long-life batteries here . "
B,Task,"Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries comm "
B,Task,"but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery comm "
B,Task,"like are used in high-tech watches comm "
B,Task,"where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . "
B,Task,"Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . "
B,Task,"Or a solar battery comm "
B,Task,"although there are slight um complications with solar batteries "
B,Task,"as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago comm flashlights . "
B,Task,"Not quite sure what that is comm "
B,Task,"but that's the description that I received comm "
B,Task,"so that's what I'm passing on to you . "
B,Task,"So those are our options . "
B,Task,"Um personal preferences that I was thinking through "
B,Task,"here's what we've been talking about all through comm fashion and simplicity . "
B,Task,"So if we're going for fashion in our cases comm I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case comm probably with a variety of design elements . "
B,Task,"Maybe titanium comm "
B,Task,"maybe some wood . "
B,Task,"We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials comm "
B,Task,"but that's sort of what I have in mind . "
B,Task,"And we wanna go for simplicity . "
B,Task,"Probably pushbuttons comm "
B,Elicit,"but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel comm if anyone has anything "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"any ideas on that ? "
B,Task,"I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons "
B,Task,"which are exactly like what they're describing comm "
B,Task,"so that might be something we wanna look into . "
B,Task,"And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . "
B,Task,"Solar I don't think would be such a good idea comm "
B,Task,"because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . "
B,Task,"But this idea of the kinetic comm that you don't have to replace comm "
B,Task,"and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work comm "
B,Task,"I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . "
B,Task,"But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip "
B,Task,"to keep our costs down . "
B,Task,"Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . "
B,Task,"So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t "
B,Task,"technological if they don't need to be comm "
B,Task,"'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . "
B,Task,"That's what I have for options . "
B,Elicit,"Um I'd appreciate anyone's input comm "
B,Task,"but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing . "
D,Elicit,"Is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing ? "
B,Task,"I'm not sure . "
B,Task,"I haven't received any specific "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"visuals of this yet . "
D,Task,"'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like comm you know comm like two sides that curve "
B,Minor,"This is what I'm sort of "
D,Task,"and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"but I've no idea . "
B,Task,"I'm not sure comm "
B,Other,"but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures . "
D,Other,"Sounds good . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm I wonder "
B,Task,"I know if we do have a double-curved case comm it can't have any titanium in it . "
B,Task,"But the titanium comm they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us "
B,Task,"as being used in the space programme comm "
B,Task,"so that could be quite interesting . "
B,Task,"Space-age remote . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Just all things to keep in mind . "
A,Task,"Just an interesting marketing kind of element . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's about all I have to do comm guys . "
B,Other,"I hope I didn't go through that too quickly . "
A,Other,"Uh just a real quick question "
A,Elicit,"um the weight of these different elements comm have you "
B,Other,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"n "
B,Task,"no idea comm no idea . "
A,Other,"no idea comm okay . "
B,Task,"Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and that a tita titanium is very light comm I know comm "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"um but other than "
B,Task,"that's really basic comm "
B,Task,"I mean comm that's all I have gotten so far . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Alright ? "
B,Elicit,"Any other questions ? "
C,Task,"Uh-huh . Don't think so . "
B,Other,"No ? "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
B,Task,"I have save this in the uh shared projects comm if anyone wants to look "
A,Other,"Thank you comm perfect . "
B,Task,"and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well comm if anyone needs any more information . Uh "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
A,Task,"Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um underneath our "
B,Task,"Just in my notebook comm "
A,Other,"oh comm uh in your book comm "
A,Task,"then don't worry about that . "
B,Task,"but if anyone has any specific questions comm don't hesitate to email me or something . "
B,Minor,"Alright ? Uh "
B,Minor,"I guess I can "
A,Minor,"'Kay "
A,Task,"now we're um concepts concepts of user interface . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm um . "
A,Task,"This one's so much tighter than the other one . "
B,Task,"I know . "
A,Other,"Okay . Nope . "
A,Task,"There we go . "
A,Other,"Here you are . "
C,Other,"Jess . "
B,Other,"G oh comm geez . "
C,Minor,"Alright comm so "
C,Other,"I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . "
C,Task,"Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . "
C,Task,"We want it to be simple "
C,Task,"and we want it to be fashionable . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"other "
C,Task,"we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . "
C,Task,"Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control comm "
C,Task,"so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are "
C,Task,"and make sure that we include that we've included all of those "
C,Task,"and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . "
C,Task,"We have a number of different choices for a design concept um "
C,Other,"and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of "
C,Elicit,"um comm but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work comm "
C,Minor,"how how "
C,Elicit,"what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . "
C,Task,"Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it comm we can then design the features around the concept comm "
C,Task,"making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . "
C,Task,"And of course we also have to make it look cool . "
C,Minor,"So basically comm "
C,Task,"that's what we don't want . "
C,Task,"M we don't want lots of buttons comm uh complicated features . "
C,Task,"We want something that looks nice and simple . "
C,Task,"Here's a a fairly simple device . "
B,Task,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"This is an an iPod from Apple . "
C,Task,"Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . "
C,Task,"It's very minimalistic in its design . "
C,Task,"Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Task,"Um the thing I like about this is that "
C,Task,"it's very very quick to access the main features . "
C,Task,"Uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track comm next track and play pause . "
C,Task,"They're the main the main features of the iPod comm the things you will use a all the time . "
C,Task,"Um then if you want to do anything more advanced comm you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen "
C,Task,"and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . "
C,Task,"So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um "
C,Task,"here's a another example . "
C,Task,"This is uh it's an interesting idea "
C,Task,"and I think i it looks pretty cool . "
C,Task,"Um it's certainly got novelty value . "
C,Task,"Uh it's nice and colourful comm it's nice and bright . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . "
C,Task,"The buttons are are different shapes "
C,Minor,"and and you can sort of "
C,Minor,"yeah "
C,Task,"if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever comm you can work out which button's which "
C,Minor,"and basically comm yeah "
C,Task,"it's ith it's fun . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . "
C,Task,"So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . "
C,Task,"I mean most people comm when they watch T_V_ comm they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ "
C,Task,"and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"you have buttons for your favourite channel comm "
C,Task,"changing the volume comm "
C,Task,"which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ comm "
C,Task,"and the button to switch it off comm in case you get bored . "
C,Task,"Um other features comm things like adjusting the brightness comm tuning the T_V_ comm "
C,Task,"uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ . "
C,Task,"Um but these are these are all necessary functions . "
C,Minor,"Uh you can't have a t "
C,Task,"there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast comm "
C,Task,"so we need to find a way of including these somehow . "
C,Task,"Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system comm a bit like on the iPod . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself comm "
C,Task,"or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television "
C,Task,"and can b be controlled through the device . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"And that would allow you to access access the advanced features "
C,Task,"uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ? "
C,Task,"I think that's that's one way to go comm "
C,Task,"yes . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display comm "
C,Task,"it's it's nice comm "
C,Task,"because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"There are disadvantages comm "
C,Task,"an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small comm "
C,Minor,"'cause we're we're I "
B,Task,"Right "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Minor,"we're "
C,Elicit,"I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . "
C,Task,"Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it comm "
C,Task,"'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark comm "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . "
C,Task,"The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . Uh "
C,Task,"a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes "
C,Task,"where you you press the buttons "
C,Task,"and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"I mean that that's also a good idea . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"It's "
C,Task,"it can it does have it's problems as well comm "
C,Task,"if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room comm it's hard to read the little text that comes up . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . "
A,Minor,"Um and so "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"like favourite channels is is applicable comm "
A,Task,"but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"Are you are you tak "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Like "
A,Task,"I I know I use that often enough . "
D,Task,"Wait comm "
D,Elicit,"but is that separate from what he was saying ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote comm I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly comm rather than menu as what's on . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that that would be one of the features comm yes . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"But it's it's it's "
A,Task,"'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box comm "
C,Task,"something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c uh communication is one way comm "
A,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control comm at least I don't think you can . "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"good point . "
A,Other,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Um I'm not sure . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"now we're moving on to market . Marketing . "
D,Elicit,"Should I plug that in ? "
C,Elicit,"Is that going on ? Okay . "
D,Minor,"Maybe it's just not "
C,Task,"Uh that should be alright comm actually . "
D,Elicit,"Is it on ? "
D,Minor,"Ri "
D,Elicit,"What F_ do you have to press comm "
D,Elicit,"five ? "
A,Task,"Eight . "
D,Other,"I just keep pressing lots of 'em . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be . "
D,Task,"If anything comm the that they gave me . "
B,Task,"No signal . "
A,Other,"Oops comm "
A,Task,"it's not plugged in comm quite in well enough . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"There we are . "
B,Other,"Oop comm "
B,Task,"there we go . "
A,Task,"Mm 'kay . "
D,Other,"Oh yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so "
D,Task,"we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching . "
D,Task,"Basically comm I was given um an executive summary "
D,Task,"that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted comm "
D,Task,"and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"first um they had people they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls comm "
D,Task,"and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference comm "
D,Task,"but that really comm over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes comm "
D,Task,"so that just goes back to "
D,Task,"the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion "
D,Minor,"and so comm "
D,Task,"even though we're stressing comm when we're talking comm we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea comm "
D,Task,"they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . "
D,Task,"And as these are ranked comm the top one is doubly important to the second one comm "
D,Task,"which is doubly important to the third one comm "
D,Task,"so just to take that weight into account . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . "
D,Task,"That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen comm things like that . "
D,Task,"And then ease of use was the third most important comm "
D,Minor,"whi "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"really comm no matter what comm we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel comm according to this . "
D,Task,"I don't know how much we agree with that . "
D,Task,"And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes comm "
D,Task,"shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy comm tight material . "
A,Minor,"S "
A,Other,"sweet . "
D,Other,"And so that brings us to my personal preferences . "
D,Elicit,"Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding . "
D,Task,"Personally comm I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale comm excuse the pun comm um in a year comm so "
D,Task,"even though this is coming from us as comm you know comm trend watch comm market research comm "
D,Elicit,"I don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away . "
D,Task,"Also comm considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction comm I'm a little hesitant as to like comm how these questions may have been worded comm "
D,Task,"and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . "
D,Task,"Personally comm like I might reverse it comm "
D,Task,"but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what comm we have to stress fashion the most . "
D,Task,"But it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material . "
B,Other,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"That "
B,Other,"there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them comm "
D,Task,"that pretty much sums it up . So yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"do we have any s some questions for this comm "
A,Task,"let's see um . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"what can I possibly enlighten on ? "
A,Elicit,"Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? "
A,Minor,"Like "
A,Elicit,"could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? "
A,Task,"It would be easier on the hands . "
B,Task,"If it's latex if it's latexy "
A,Minor,"It's kind of and then it "
B,Minor,"Um comm mean "
C,Minor,"A kind of thing that "
A,Task,"we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that comm "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"An uh I if th "
A,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside comm "
B,Task,"but that it's covered with the latex comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"which is spongier and softer on your hands . "
B,Minor,"It's "
B,Task,"there's something to be said comm I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"and and "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"so something comm m m instead of a necess "
B,Task,"something grippable comm "
B,Task,"I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy comm maybe . "
D,Task,"yeah comm grip comm "
D,Task,"I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Minor,"i and I think "
D,Task,"I'm envisioning more like comm you know comm the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time comm "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"like "
D,Task,"I'm imagining that sort of thing comm "
D,Task,"I don't know what th that material's called . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's that seems doable . "
B,Elicit,"could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? "
B,Task,"We could colour-co-ordinate them comm "
A,Task,"F for sure comm "
A,Task,"or maybe like "
B,Minor,"li "
A,Task,"um couple main ones being like comm I dunno comm lemons or strawberries or something . "
B,Task,"The buttons could be fruit-shaped . "
A,Elicit,"Could they be smelly ? "
C,Elicit,"I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? Uh like uh I dunno comm like uh carrots or something . "
B,Minor,"Oh well "
D,Other,"Oh God . "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot "
A,Other,"Or carrot shaped comm "
A,Task,"mm . "
B,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
C,Task,"Maybe comm "
B,Task,"Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . "
C,Minor,"or "
A,Task,"Like large button comm "
A,Task,"that's what I was thinking of comm "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Elicit,"What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . Like in terms of holding it . Like that's a f shape of a fruit . "
C,Elicit,"Kind of like a potato . "
B,Minor,"be "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"It'd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think . "
D,Task,"Just to tie it in a little . "
A,Minor,"Might "
A,Elicit,"would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it ? "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Cause I think the reason they're long is "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"It'd be harder to press button . "
C,Task,"Depends . "
A,Task,"Harder to push . "
C,Elicit,"When you when you use a remote comm do you press the buttons with your thumb comm usually ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Or your fingers ? "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"I usually hold it in one hand . "
A,Task,"Maybe "
C,Task,"Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone comm "
B,Minor,"I "
C,Task,"so you you hold it in one hand comm "
C,Task,"and you press the buttons with your thumb . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's ts how I tend to do it . "
A,Task,"But then the buttons would have to be very small . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"Don't you think ? "
D,Task,"'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around . "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"just thumb-sized . "
B,Minor,"Jus "
D,Minor,"But I like i "
A,Task,"But I mean in order to get to all of them comm "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"you know . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other . "
C,Task,"Maybe . "
B,Task,"That's true . "
C,Task,"But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway comm then it's it's not so much a problem comm perhaps . "
B,Other,"Right . "
B,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod comm that's how I do it comm hold it and press the four . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"So you hold it in one hand "
C,Other,"and you press you press the buttons with your thumb "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"or in "
B,Task,"and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . "
C,Minor,"and "
C,Elicit,"And you find that works quite well ? "
D,Task,"I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Is that "
D,Minor,"'Cause th "
C,Elicit,"The button on an iPod comm is it what is it comm "
C,Elicit,"is it just four buttons "
C,Elicit,"or is it li more like a scroll thing ? "
D,Task,"It's like five comm "
A,Task,"It's a scroll comm yeah comm it's a wheel . "
D,Task,"'cause there's one in the middle . "
B,Minor,"It "
B,Minor,"wel well "
B,Task,"yeah comm "
B,Minor,"it would "
B,Task,"I mean each version of it has been a little bit different comm "
A,Task,"The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it comm I don't think . "
B,Minor,"but "
B,Other,"Oh yeah comm "
B,Task,"you had one of the in-between ones comm "
B,Task,"when they weren't doing that anymore . "
B,Minor,"Ts "
C,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"and you press the centre button comm "
B,Task,"that's that's your all-purpose select button right there . "
C,Other,"Oh comm I see comm right comm yeah . "
C,Other,"Oh comm okay . "
B,Task,"Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's quite a good design . "
D,Task,"I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Like just the idea of like those "
D,Task,"so few buttons for main things comm "
B,Minor,"Uh uh "
B,Minor,"t "
D,Task,"but then how you could go back to the menu "
D,Minor,"and like comm "
D,Task,"I dunno "
D,Elicit,"if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . "
D,Task,"I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_ comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"'cause if you're changing the brightness comm don't you wanna see it happening comm kind of ? "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And then you could still have that available . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory comm but not as useful in practice . "
C,Task,"I think it could be difficult in practice comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Also z yeah comm 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen comm than back up at your T_V_ "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"and people don't wanna do that . "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Okay um "
B,Other,"Oh "
B,Task,"we probably have to get going comm "
A,Task,"we have we've about fifteen minutes left comm "
B,Elicit,"don't we ? "
A,Other,"so I'm I'm gonna "
A,Other,"continue with my pres presentation . "
A,Task,"Um I've one more slide before we close comm "
A,Task,"but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things comm "
A,Other,"so I'll just bring that up and show you all "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"before we move on . Um "
D,Other,"If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables comm I'll let you know . "
B,Elicit,"Could Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours comm "
C,Elicit,"Like comm to make it different fruits . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's possible . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and then like the the covers could be spongy latex "
B,Task,"Exactly . "
A,Minor,"wherea "
A,Task,"but the actual model could be titanium . "
B,Task,"And you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever . "
C,Minor,"I think maybe th the packaging comm "
B,Other,"All these options . "
C,Task,"it should be like a lemon "
C,Task,"and the the packaging is like the peel . "
C,Task,"So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it comm "
B,Task,"Ooh . "
C,Task,"and the remote control's inside . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"there we go . "
B,Task,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Don't know . "
A,Task,"Ah hmm hmm hmm . "
D,Task,"The iPod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun . "
D,Task,"It's like the way it all comes all cute . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Mm . Options . "
D,Other,"Lemons ? "
A,Minor,"Okay comm um "
A,Elicit,"components concept . Energy comm chip on print . "
B,Other,"Uh-hu oh comm oh yes . "
B,Minor,"Right comm "
A,Minor,"G "
B,Task,"I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get "
B,Task,"be necessary "
B,Minor,"but um "
A,Task,"That's th th this is the agenda they gave me . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Alright comm "
A,Task,"can you just explain what that is real quick ? "
B,Minor,"so um "
B,Minor,"decisions comm what the "
B,Minor,"okay "
B,Task,"deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um I dunno comm "
B,Elicit,"what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? "
A,Task,"I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool . "
B,Minor,"Am I "
B,Elicit,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"I mean comm "
D,Task,"it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm um I think it's good comm "
C,Task,"as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is comm "
C,Task,"but as far as I know comm the technology is good . "
B,Minor,"Right comm "
B,Task,"I haven't gotten any "
D,Task,"Costs . "
B,Task,"yeah comm "
B,Task,"any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery comm "
B,Task,"but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip comm then it'll even out comm I think . "
D,Task,"But over time "
B,Other,"Um circuit boards . "
B,Minor,"Um yeah comm "
B,Task,"I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . "
B,Task,"They're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them comm "
B,Task,"and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine comm "
B,Task,"which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . "
B,Other,"I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . "
B,Task,"I wasn't really given any options comm "
B,Task,"I was just given that this is how they're done . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um yeah comm "
B,Task,"I can't can't really tell you . "
B,Task,"I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works . "
B,Other,"But I don't know any decisions on "
A,Task,"If they're if they're really options . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"I'm sorry comm "
B,Minor,"I did f "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same comm I think . "
C,Task,"Uh it's fairly fairly standard . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"then we'll move on to the case . "
A,Minor,"Um oh "
A,Minor,"bu "
A,Task,"I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple comm a regular comm or an advanced chip comm maybe . "
B,Task,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Well okay comm "
B,Other,"here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got . "
B,Task,"Um simple comm regular comm advanced chip on print . "
B,Task,"The chip on print includes an infrared sensor comm "
B,Task,"so we don't have to worry about that . "
B,Minor,"Um comm 'kay comm "
B,Minor,"the pushbutton "
B,Task,"if we're gonna have pushbuttons comm they require a simple chip comm "
B,Task,"but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip comm "
B,Task,"and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . "
B,Elicit,"Do we want a scroll wheel comm "
B,Elicit,"or do we just want pushbuttons ? "
C,Task,"Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . "
C,Task,"I mean it might be nice for changing the volume . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"It would be nice for changing the volume comm "
C,Minor,"Uh but "
A,Task,"but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . "
C,Task,"I don't think it would really work . "
A,Task,"'Cause you don't have control over numbers "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"it's a "
A,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"you really need buttons for changing a channel . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"th it'd be "
B,Minor,"it'd be handy for going through "
B,Task,"if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices comm than you can scroll down on the scroll . "
D,Task,"But if you c if you could scroll through the channels comm and then the volume would just be "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We have five minutes left for the meeting comm so . "
D,Task,"and the volume would just be like the same way comm forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And otherwise comm no matter how may buttons we have comm we're gonna have like comm you know comm black with red sticking out "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"and th no "
D,Task,"it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Elicit,"have a scroll for volume ? "
B,Minor,"F "
B,Elicit,"or for all those secret functions ? "
A,Minor,"F "
B,Task,"When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . "
C,Task,"I think yeah comm I think a scroll wheel would be nice comm "
C,Task,"but it's not necessary . Um "
B,Other,"Right . "
B,Task,"So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip comm depending "
B,Task,"and maybe we could table that decision for later . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"I think w "
A,Minor,"well "
A,Task,"I think when we go on to the une userface comm we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"let's think about that while we talk about the case . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"let's do case . "
B,Task,"Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex comm if if spongy is the in thing . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I'm a little um I'm a little hesitant about it comm "
A,Task,"because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Elicit,"could it be hard comm and then something around it ? "
B,Task,"Uh yeah comm "
B,Minor,"everything I've "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . "
B,Minor,"N oh wha what I've "
B,Task,"what I've seen comm just not related to this comm but of latex cases before comm is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside comm and it's just covered with the latex . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Not too thick a layer of latex comm just enough to be grippable comm like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"The inside is hard . "
B,Task,"I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board comm "
A,Minor,"Ge o "
B,Task,"I think that that's done for us . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"'Kay . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"we uh we do want latex . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Latex . "
A,Elicit,"Um and probably in colours comm maybe fruity comm vegetable colours . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Fruity colours . "
A,Minor,"Okay um "
A,Task,"let's go to the ufe user interface "
A,Task,"then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Task,"and we want a curved case comm "
B,Elicit,"yeah ? "
B,Elicit,"Or a double-curved ? "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"we don't really know what the difference is comm "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Task,"I'm thinking curved of some sort . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We don't really know what the difference "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"interface comm the type and the supplements . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"push or scroll comm "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"Yep . "
A,Elicit,"Or both ? "
C,Task,"Um And I think if we wanna keep our costs down comm we should just go for pushbuttons comm "
C,Task,"'cause then we can have a a simple chip "
C,Task,"and it's simpler comm "
C,Task,"it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . "
B,Task,"Good point . "
C,Task,"So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through comm like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's uh it's it's fairly simple . "
A,Minor,"I think that "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information "
B,Task,"but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton comm "
B,Task,"but it's gotta be some more expensive comm "
B,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"because "
A,Elicit,"Is that okay with you ? "
A,Elicit,"How you feeling ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And let's like see if we get anything else . "
D,Task,"I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel comm "
D,Task,"it's more just to give it a different kind of look comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool comm then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . "
A,Task,"It might be cool enough . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons comm "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"and then supplements comm "
A,Elicit,"how are we gonna do that ? "
C,Other,"Uh what do you mean by supplements comm exactly ? "
A,Task,"Um I assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use . "
C,Minor,"Um "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Elicit,"So we're gonna have like a menu button comm "
C,Task,"Yep . "
A,Elicit,"so that we can access on-screen things then ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"um so "
B,Task,"Alright . "
C,Minor,"Um in "
A,Task,"we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"what are what are our buttons gonna be ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . On off comm "
B,Task,"On off "
C,Task,"uh volume comm favourite channels comm uh and menu . "
B,Elicit,"So like one through five comm or "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah "
D,Elicit,"Like a radio type sorta situation ? "
C,Minor,"about "
C,Task,"yeah like yeah comm a bit like radio presets . Um "
A,Other,"Pre-set channels "
A,Task,"and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero comm "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"Uh we wouldn't even need the numbers . "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"I think maybe numbers seems is kind of old-fashioned . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Minor,"but in order to pre-set a cha "
A,Other,"oh "
A,Task,"I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
C,Minor,"you can just "
B,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and you need some kind of comm I dunno comm sort of up down kind of button comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm up down . "
C,Task,"but the volume control could double for that comm for example . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm um "
A,Task,"finishing the meeting now . "
A,Task,"Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes comm "
A,Task,"um you each have things to do comm look and feel design comm user interface design comm product evaluation comm "
A,Task,"and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . "
A,Task,"You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach . "
B,Task,"Ooh . "
C,Task,"Cool . "
D,Task,"Wow . "
A,Elicit,"Um did we decide on a chip ? "
A,Task,"Let's go with a simple chip ? "
B,Task,"Simple chip . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We are done . "
A,Other,"Thank you everyone . "
A,Minor,"Oh "
A,Minor,"I di "
A,Task,"these are already in our shared folder comm so . "
B,Other,"Okay comm cool . "
B,Other,"Clay . "
C,Task,"Clay . I wasn't expecting that . "
