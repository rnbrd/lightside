A,Elicit,"Is everyone ready to start ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Okay . Great . "
A,Other,"Well comm welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . "
A,Other,"I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um comm "
A,Task,"on the agenda for this comm um comm for this particular meeting comm we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting comm after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . "
A,Task,"And comm um comm then we have to make some key decisions on comm on our remote control concept comm and how we're gonna make it comm what uh materials we're gonna use comm and that sort of thing . "
A,Task,"The meeting will be forty minutes long . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Alright comm and I will switch up PowerPoint . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Should be just loading . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"although I can't see it on my screen . "
B,Other,"That says go here . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use comm um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . "
B,Task,"Um comm first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made comm "
B,Task,"and what is it happens inside the casing comm which is more your field . "
B,Task,"Um comm thes main internal feature is a circuit board comm which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . "
B,Task,"Which is not necessarily a battery comm as we're about to see . "
B,Task,"Um comm there are several components of comm um comm the circuit board that we need to consider comm where we'll be getting them from comm what they'll be made of . "
B,Task,"Um comm including the integrated circuit comm which is also known as the chip . "
B,Task,"Which is where all the main information is uh contained . "
B,Task,"Um comm diodes comm transistors comm resonators comm resistors comm and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . "
B,Task,"Um comm and all their positioning in the circuit . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"Are they all included comm like mandatorily comm or r are these different options ? "
B,Minor,"Uh comm these comm "
B,Task,"they're all different options comm "
B,Task,"they're all separate comm apart from the chip comm which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple comm a regular comm advanced . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We can go into that later . "
B,Task,"Um comm all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately comm "
B,Task,"and work out the most comm like comm effective um circuit comm including all the wires and everything like that . "
B,Task,"And the L_E_D_ of course comm that's a light emitting diode . "
B,Minor,"So comm we could comm "
B,Task,"so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things comm with that as well . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Okay comm there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . "
B,Task,"We could use a basic battery comm "
B,Task,"but that brings with it comm like they need to be recharged and the bulk comm the size of it as well . "
B,Task,"And they're not so great to dispose of comm environmentally . "
B,Task,"There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . "
B,Task,"A bit out of date . "
B,Task,"Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"What is a hand-powered dynamo ? "
B,Task,"Um comm where you manually charge up the power . "
B,Task,"Like you wind up something . "
A,Elicit,"Just every comm every once in a while ? "
B,Other,"Sorry ? "
A,Elicit,"Just every once in a while or constantly ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . Every once in a while I think "
B,Minor,". But it's "
A,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It would be like going a step back in time . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices comm where you just shake the device and it gives it power . "
B,Task,"I mean comm the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . "
B,Task,"Um comm or there's solar power comm "
B,Task,"which we've been considering inside a building comm which is where it's gonna be used comm might not be quite so useful . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"But comm good to look into comm "
B,Task,"renewable energy comm always the way . "
B,Task,"Um comm lots of considerations for the case comm like what sort of shape it would be comm curved or flat . "
B,Task,"That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . "
B,Task,"Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . "
B,Task,"We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . "
B,Task,"Or too small . "
B,Task,"Or too slidy . "
B,Task,"I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back comm "
B,Task,"'cause it had so many buttons on comm and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Because you can't really see which way round it is . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Um comm we also can choose what materials "
B,Minor,"um comm the "
B,Task,"we could use metal comm "
B,Task,"we could use rubber "
B,Task,"which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . "
B,Task,"It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that comm so it's very like soft comm not so stressful on your hands . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Wood . "
B,Task,"Um comm again comm stepping back in time again there . "
B,Task,"I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm titanium is not gonna be possible comm even though it just it beyond our budget really . "
B,Task,"But comm would've been maybe for future projects . "
B,Task,"Um right our choice for buttons as well . "
B,Minor,"We've developed some "
B,Task,"we've got some good advances in technology comm "
B,Task,"with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . "
B,Minor,"I think that was brought up for comm um comm "
B,Task,"they're basically quite a flexible design comm modern comm you don't have to use individual buttons . "
B,Task,"You can just slide up and down . "
B,Task,"I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . "
A,Minor,"It comm it "
A,Task,"we would have to have an L_C_D_ um "
B,Task,"Yeah . That's true . "
A,Task,"display comm "
A,Task,"and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult . "
B,Minor,"And that would lead to an advanced "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"If we have "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um comm also we've got the integrated pushbutton comm which is what we're most familiar with . "
B,Task,"It's the most straightforward . "
B,Task,"But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . . "
B,Task,"Got decisions to make there . "
B,Task,"And this is what I was just saying before . "
B,Task,"Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . "
B,Task,"Um simple would go with the pushbutton . "
B,Task,"Um comm regular you could link with the scroll button . "
B,Task,"And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"My personal preferences ? "
B,Task,"I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . "
B,Minor,"I don't comm "
B,Task,"I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology . "
B,Task,"It's not been seen before comm so it could be quite a comm a novelty factor comm "
B,Task,"attractive as well . "
B,Task,"And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy comm you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . "
B,Task,"You just give it a shake . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Sounds brilliant to me . "
B,Task,"Rubber casing I thing would probably the best comm if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . "
B,Task,"Um comm and gives you comm yeah comm more flexibility there . "
B,Task,"And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple comm "
B,Task,"then we could possibly have the scroll and the push comm "
B,Task,"but no L_C_D_ comm 'cause we probably can't afford that one . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um comm one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"like as the exterior . "
A,Elicit,"This is the one thing that's protecting its innards . "
B,Task,"I think that would comm uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . "
B,Task,"And the rubber would just be the comm what's in contact with the human . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um comm is it "
A,Task,"I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . "
A,Task,"Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . "
A,Task,"It would work that way . "
B,Task,"Maybe if the comm um comm if it was just kind of a comm more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . "
C,Minor,"W "
B,Task,"So comm it was kind of comm the whole thing would be removable . "
C,Elicit,"Like plastic with rubber comm kind of on top "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Like "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I can't think of what . "
C,Task,"Well comm there's comm there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"b like a Nokia it is . "
B,Minor,"Or like an "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something comm that's just it's protective as well . "
C,Minor,"It's "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Like the skin ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"It comm it stops it comm I mean comm "
B,Task,"it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something comm as well comm 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
B,Task,"I think i maybe a mixture of both there comm maybe . "
A,Minor,"So maybe the "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . "
B,Minor,"And then "
B,Task,"yeah . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"And the buttons obviously are rubber . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That sounds good . "
A,Minor,"I comm um comm "
A,Elicit,"is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ? "
B,Task,"As far as I know . It should be . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we'll just say yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yes comm just why not . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"I like the kinetic energy source idea . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"I thought that was "
A,Task,"Um comm I don't know when people will comm um comm be moving a remote around a lot . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm tha "
A,Task,"But I think that it's worth it comm kinetety comm kinetic um "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"energy source . "
A,Task,"It could make an we could have any kind of style . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky comm "
A,Minor,"and "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Just for environmental reasons . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So it seems we'd have to do more research on it . "
D,Task,"Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Like as a backup for something . "
C,Task,"Backup . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so there's there is a one battery comm because most remotes use two batteries I believe . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So comm if it was running off of one battery as a "
C,Task,"That would be good yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Some alternative just in case something went wrong . "
D,Task,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Maybe we could "
C,Task,"you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors comm "
C,Task,"but a lot of calculators comm yeah comm have solar power . "
B,Task,"That's true . "
B,Task,"I just thought of that . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"So maybe that could be incorporated as "
B,Task,"May maybe that could be the backup . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Instead of a battery . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Although it needs some light comm "
B,Task,"Like solar backup . "
D,Elicit,"doesn't it ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . I suppose "
C,Minor,"Do comm do those calculators "
A,Task,"Yeah comm you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then . "
D,Minor,"So comm if we're doing "
B,Minor,"s but some "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"If we're "
B,Task,"But thing is comm it's not you don't need the solar all the time . "
C,Task,"I don't know how it works . "
B,Task,"It can be stored . "
B,Minor,"It can be like "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Like a few hours a day . . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think that might be a little impractical though . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think sometimes it's just shoved under comm under a cushion comm "
D,Minor,"and yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's true . "
B,Minor,"It could easily "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Like people don't wanna have to worry about that . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think comm oh no comm I forgot to charge my remote today . "
B,Task,"Like if the kinetic thing comm I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"You don't have to comm "
B,Task,"you know comm you can shake it a few times comm or whatever . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And it works . "
A,Task,"Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I suppose . "
B,Task,"Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Alright . Cool . "
B,Minor,"K okay . "
A,Elicit,"'S that the end of your presentation . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Other,"There we go . "
C,Other,"Thanks . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"It's not on my screen . "
C,Elicit,"Why ? "
B,Task,"it wasn't on mine either . "
B,Task,"I don't know why . "
B,Task,"I think comm I just comm I just used the mouse on there . "
C,Other,"You don't know why ? "
C,Task,"Oh okay . "
C,Elicit,"Is it that one ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"That's um "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Um comm I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . "
C,Other,"Uh comm first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . "
C,Task,"It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived comm for example comm heard or felt maybe comm or by the human user . "
C,Task,"And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data . "
C,Task,"Um comm there are two types of user interfaces . "
C,Task,"There's the graphical user interface comm which emphasises the use of pictures for output "
C,Task,"and a pointing device comm for example a mouse for input control . "
C,Task,"So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about . "
A,Other,"Oh . Okay . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I'm not really sure about the pictures that "
C,Task,"maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Or maybe it's "
C,Task,"the the buttons or pictures or something . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Do you think it's "
B,Minor,"So I suppose sometime "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm 'cause "
B,Task,"after you . "
A,Other,"I'm sorry ? "
A,Task,"Um comm because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard comm "
A,Task,"so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You're pressing the numbers for comm um comm for what you want . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So you must comm for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . "
C,Task,"Like an L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Task,"I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And if you wanted to go onto teletext or comm "
B,Task,"I know we're not having that comm but I mean a similar thing comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"you comm they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it comm "
B,Task,"which I suppose it's that sort of thing like the comm the symbol on the button . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But if we're having a simplified display anyway comm w that comm we probably won't have to focus so much on that . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"we'll be doing "
B,Task,"It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It'd be more a command interface comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"and then "
B,Task,"I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume comm display comm and stuff like that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ? "
D,Elicit,"The infrared is like comm that's considered a "
B,Minor,"I "
A,Other,"Hmm ? "
C,Task,"No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the comm that's on the buttons of the remote control comm "
C,Minor,"and per "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"So when it says pointing device that doesn't include "
B,Minor,"For inp "
C,Task,"Well it could be a wee scroller thing comm and something could come up on the screen . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"But um "
C,Task,"I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway comm "
C,Task,"to make it more simplistic . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But the comm we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points comm "
C,Minor,"as in "
C,Task,"just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe . "
A,Elicit,"What do you mean ? "
C,Minor,"Like "
C,Task,"I can't think of an example comm "
C,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"Sort of like little pictures rather than "
A,Other,"Oh yeah comm "
A,Minor,"like how the buttons "
C,Task,"Like a little sound . "
C,Task,"Instead of saying volume comm like a little speaker or something . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm as a button though . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"something y "
A,Task,"So comm it's a keyboard in the shape of it comm "
C,Task,"Yeah m perha yeah . Yeah . Maybe . "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . I like that idea . "
C,Minor,"Um comm the co uh "
C,Task,"we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . "
C,Task,"As it would be less complicated comm and the controls would be more user-friendly . "
C,Task,"Um comm the remote control would be cheaper to design comm so that we'd have more money in the budget to comm um comm target the design area of the interface . "
C,Task,"You know comm make it more trendy and original . "
C,Task,"We'll have more money if we keep it simple . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"A bit more too comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Seeing as it's quite a new technology . Um "
C,Task,"We comm we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our comm um comm more user-friendly remote control comm that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons comm "
C,Minor,"that comm um comm "
C,Task,"that their functions comm colours and forms aren't always helpful . "
B,Task,"Yeah . That's true . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It can be a bit comm yeah comm overwhelming . "
C,Task,"And that all interfaces are different . "
C,Minor,"So comm um comm "
C,Task,"that doesn't improve the use of the produ product comm "
C,Task,"so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand . "
C,Task,"And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Elicit,"Does anyone have any questions ? "
A,Elicit,"Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour comm just to keep it comm give it a simplistic look . "
C,Task,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I think if we go with the um design plate thing comm we'll have to . "
D,Task,"Just because of colour clashing comm "
D,Task,"and if we wanted to comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"so and comm "
D,Task,"and we might comm I mean comm depending on what comes out of the design comm we might have to stick to just black buttons . "
C,Minor,"But um "
A,Elicit,"But what about the lighting up effect ? "
D,Other,"You mean different colours for the lighting or "
A,Task,"Um comm well comm um comm I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . "
A,Task,"And so if they were black comm it wouldn't be possible for them to light up . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Oh I see what you're saying . "
D,Minor,"Well y "
A,Task,"If they were white they would glow comm probably . "
A,Task,"If they were made out of rubber . "
D,Other,"Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . "
D,Minor,"I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"But comm but I guess comm you mean from the back . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Elicit,"Where would the light come from ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I'd assume comm like comm an internal light comm that comes through . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So there would have to comm have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons comm or something . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and well rubber is a more translucent product too comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"so we have that taken care of . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"It should be able to "
B,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"In the phone that I was thinking of as well comm when you change the um covers of it comm the comm the little buttons that actually comm you know comm that contro control stuff comm are behind the rubber . "
B,Minor,"Li yeah . "
C,Task,"So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . "
C,Elicit,"Do you know what I mean ? "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"'Cause it's just the wee control comm "
D,Other,"They comm they insert over . "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"thing that's behind it . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I mean comm we don't have to decide on one colour . "
C,Task,"Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ? "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Well comm if they're raised up buttons . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So that you can feel them . "
A,Task,"We were talking about it being more "
A,Task,"um comm a lot more tangible . "
D,Minor,"T "
A,Task,"Um comm it might be more difficult to do . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"If they're comm if they're sticking up . "
A,Task,"If it's flat then comm like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone comm it's like all very flat comm "
A,Task,"and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons comm but "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think it would be possible . "
B,Task,"I don't think it would make that much difference . "
B,Task,"I mean comm the uh the dimensions of it . "
B,Task,"'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . "
B,Task,"And then you get to the circuit . "
B,Task,"I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the comm the top casing . "
B,Task,"I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing comm without causing too much difficulty . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I'm sure that'd be fine . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"If it's do-able we can do . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm sounds good to me . "
C,Task,"So that's everything comm then ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm "
A,Other,"thank you . "
D,Elicit,"Okay is that my turn then ? "
A,Task,"That means you're up . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
D,Task,"I have a shorter report for you today . "
D,Task,"Um comm it took a while to get this comm uh "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"You're not plugged in yet . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"That's a very good point . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so um comm "
D,Task,"this report is about uh trend-watching . "
D,Task,"Um comm basically so we can live up to our comm our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . "
D,Other,"Sorry . "
D,Other,"There we go . "
D,Minor,"Um So comm "
D,Task,"just so you know comm my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . "
D,Task,"I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan comm New York and Paris . "
D,Task,"And I looked at the design reports from previous years comm here at Real Remote . "
D,Task,"Um comm just so c we can work off of them comm see how fashions have changed . "
D,Other,"Um comm so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . "
D,Task,"Um comm and they comm they're each more important than the one that comes after it . "
D,Task,"Uh comm the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel comm instead of the current functional look-and-feel . "
D,Task,"Um comm this should be our priority comm as we've been saying . "
D,Task,"The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . "
D,Task,"So comm I think we've done a lot of talking about that comm "
D,Task,"just with lighting and the buttons and the face-plates . "
D,Task,"Um comm so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that . "
D,Task,"And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use . "
D,Task,"So comm pretty basic there . "
D,Task,"And the recent fashion update comm uh comm according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan comm is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes comm shoes and furniture . "
D,Task,"Um comm also comm in contra uh in contrast to last year comm the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . "
D,Task,"Again comm we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"So comm my personal preferences here comm "
D,Task,"um of course comm as we comm we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting comm "
D,Other,"and I'd like to stick to that . "
D,Task,"The fruits and vegetable themes comm I don't know if that's going to work for us . "
D,Task,"It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . "
D,Task,"I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"It could be one of the options . "
D,Task,"Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um comm the temporary light-up idea comm sounds like we're gonna stick to that . "
D,Task,"And then comm uh comm tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Everything else we can really comm we can really "
B,Task,"It is strange . "
A,Task,"um comm do comm according to our plans already comm given the market . "
A,Task,"But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control . "
D,Task,"It's comm it's a little but it comm it's everywhere . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"So maybe we "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them comm you know . "
D,Task,"But I I think comm I think if we stick to T_V_ based comm you know comm maybe T_V_ shows comm or "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Or colour schemes . "
A,Task,"But they still need to um fit into people's decor though . "
B,Minor,"We "
D,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . "
B,Task,"Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . "
B,Task,"And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . "
B,Task,"I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry comm but it could have the curves of a strawberry comm or something . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"The "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Or a strawberry seed or a leaf . "
D,Task,"The essence of strawberry . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract comm if that's fits in more with what we're doing . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Instead of fruits and vegetables comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"just if you look at it straightforward comm it's a bit "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy "
B,Task,"well comm obviously it does comm if that's the current theme . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But may maybe we could go more directly comm "
B,Minor,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But initially comm I dunno . "
B,Task,"I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit . "
A,Task,"Tone it down . Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I guess comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah and like not comm not "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"like more like photos of fruit comm on comm on our product . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Or banana-shaped . "
D,Task,"One thing I was thinking though is "
D,Task,"I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting comm we talked about our favourite animals . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So maybe there could be animal-based comm you know . "
D,Task,"Because a lot of people have a house cat . Or comm or a dog . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Um comm that might be getting comm you know comm too specific comm "
D,Task,"and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . "
D,Task,"But it's something to keep in mind . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"And comm did you have any questions ? "
D,Elicit,"Pretty straightforward ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah um "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm "
A,Task,"given that information comm we need to start making some more specific decisions . "
A,Other,"So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again . "
D,Other,"There you go . "
D,Elicit,"Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the "
B,Unlab,"I didn't for the first one . "
D,Task,"okay . "
B,Task,"But I have now . "
A,Elicit,"But it's still around right ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . Uh comm hopefully "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Where do you have to save it to ? "
B,Task,". Project documents I think . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I'm just trying to make this pop up now . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Here we go . "
A,Task,"Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . "
A,Minor,"So energy comm we "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"oh . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Other,"Oh no "
A,Task,"I can't write it in when it's in this setting . "
A,Elicit,"Does anyone know how to take it out of "
A,Minor,"Um comm "
C,Task,"Just escape I think . "
D,Other,"The PowerPoint ? "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
A,Other,"Um comm so back to decisions . "
A,Elicit,"Energy comm we've decided on kinetic comm right ? "
B,Task,"Kinetic yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so that's good . "
B,Elicit,"Are we going to have a backup ? "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Or do we just "
A,Elicit,"But would a backup really be necessary ? "
A,Elicit,"I mean will people just use the battery if there's no comm if there's comm "
B,Task,"I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy comm "
A,Elicit,"if there is backup . "
B,Task,"and "
B,Task,"be bold and innovative comm "
B,Task,"and hope this works comm and well hope that it works . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"I think "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"There's like no reason why it wouldn't work comm right ? "
B,Minor,"I think "
B,Task,"no . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"I comm I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It could even be one of our selling points . "
B,Task,"Go for it . "
B,Task,"It could be "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"fully kinetic energy . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Environmentally conscious or something . "
B,Elicit,"Is everyone happy with that ? "
D,Elicit,"So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Hope so . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm "
A,Task,"the next um decision is chip on print . "
A,Task,"I don't exactly know what that means . "
B,Task,"Um comm it was whether we went for the simple comm the regular comm or the advanced chip . "
B,Task,"And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have comm "
B,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"Right comm "
A,Elicit,"and we were going for more simplistic style comm right ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"it was "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so that was without the L_C_D_ . "
B,Task,"So that means we're not doing the advanced . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons . "
A,Elicit,"I think we decided on the pushbuttons comm right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I don "
B,Task,"Uh comm so that's the simple . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting comm the interior lighting system ? "
B,Task,"Yeah possibly . "
B,Task,"So comm it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need . "
A,Minor,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"So it's a medium . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So regular chip . "
A,Other,"That's called medium comm or regular ? "
B,Task,"Regular "
B,Other,"sorry . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
B,Other,"Regular chip . "
D,Other,"Oh comm "
D,Elicit,"is regular not simple ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Lighting . "
B,Minor,"Yeah if we "
C,Task,"It's for the lighting comm yeah . "
B,Task,"because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well . "
D,Task,"Right right right . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"and cases . "
A,Elicit,"Um comm does this comm is this dependent on shape comm or what it's made of comm or what ? "
B,Minor,"So th "
B,Task,"I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case "
B,Task,"comm which we will decide on rubber . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well comm I guess plastic and coated in rubber . "
B,Task,"Rubber . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Plastic with rubber "
B,Other,"Plastic rubber coat . "
C,Minor,"plastic coat . "
A,Other,"coating and interchangeable "
B,Elicit,"Interchangeable comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"um "
B,Elicit,"Still going for that . "
A,Task,"yeah comm interchangeable plates . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"User interface concept . "
A,Task,"This is your time to shine . "
C,Task,"We decided on the component . "
C,Other,"I comm I I'm sorry comm "
C,Task,"I've lost my um PowerPoint thing comm so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component "
B,Other,"Your screen ? "
D,Task,"Think it was called command interface . "
B,Minor,"Was it "
A,Task,"Oh comm yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Command interface comm . "
C,Minor,"The command inter "
A,Task,"Command interface . "
B,Other,"Ouch . "
C,Task,"The command line interface yeah . "
A,Other,"Did you say command line ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Line interface . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm "
A,Task,"and supplements . "
A,Elicit,"What's that all about ? "
C,Minor,"Um comm "
C,Minor,"I think that is "
C,Task,"well we haven't really made any decisions about "
C,Task,"what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions comm colours and forms comm in the in consistent use . "
C,Elicit,"Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? "
A,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"You know how um different interfaces are very different comm "
C,Task,"and can be confusing because because of their difference comm and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"We haven't really decided what to do about that . "
A,Elicit,"Um comm what are our choices here ? "
C,Task,"Well it's just um w where where shall we locate the buttons . "
C,Elicit,"What kind of functions wi shall we have ? "
A,Task,"You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels comm and we'll have the channel-changer comm and volume comm and power ? "
B,Task,"The power . "
B,Task,"Volume . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"So pretty "
A,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"just just the basic button functions . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels comm things like that comm "
A,Task,"because different televisions will have "
B,Task,"May yeah . "
B,Task,"Tone comm contrast comm and things . "
A,Minor,"Um comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"That's a bit "
D,Task,"That was on comm um one of my presentations . "
D,Task,"About how often it was used . "
D,Elicit,"Do you remember that ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it was minima "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"well comm it wasn't the l "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it was hardly ever used really . "
D,Minor,"I w "
D,Other,"Should I bring it up ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That would be good . "
A,Task,"And most televisions will come with a remote . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm each television . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"so "
A,Minor,"'Kay comm "
A,Task,"well we know we want numbers . "
D,Minor,"The ch t "
D,Task,"Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . "
D,Task,"So tw twice every once every two hours . "
D,Task,"Um comm and it was considered a one point five relevance comm on a scale of ten . "
D,Task,"That's brightness comm colour comm tone comm all that . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"You don't change that often comm yeah . "
B,Task,"I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself comm "
B,Elicit,"doesn't it ? "
B,Task,"I'm sure it has its own buttons comm so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it does . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and different televisions . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Like we comm I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So we're just going for power comm channels comm volume comm "
A,Task,"changes like that . "
A,Task,"Volume . "
D,Task,"The other one was audio settings . "
D,Task,"Mono comm stereo comm pitch . "
D,Task,"I mean I sometimes use that . "
D,Task,"Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style comm movie style comm um "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"and that comm "
D,Task,"they say that's used zero point eight times an hour comm "
D,Task,"which is actually somewhat high . "
D,Task,"Like almost once an hour . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um comm relevance of two . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"We have five minutes to finish our meeting . "
A,Other,"Crap . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm um comm "
A,Task,"let's do this fast . Um "
D,Task,"Well that didn't some up on mine . "
A,Elicit,"Should we have audio ? "
A,Task,"It only comes up on mine usually . "
C,Minor,"It w "
C,Task,"it would seem silly if we'd having anything else comm just have an audio button though . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Elicit,"Do you know ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I don't comm I it's comm "
A,Task,"it's a problem with the international uh appeal comm I think . Um comm if we have audio "
A,Task,"because we don't know how other televisions work . "
C,Minor,"But we "
A,Task,"But we know that everyone has this and it's the same . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"I guess that it affects the marketing comm "
B,Minor,"I've "
D,Task,"'cause it comm mm it is a good sales ploy to say comm aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"This one has channel comm volume and your channe and your power . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's it . "
C,Task,"That could be a sales pitch . "
B,Task,"We can just go for comm make it a selling point that it is just the basic . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Simple and "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"uh I "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"brilliant . "
A,Task,"Good . "
A,Task,"And comm okay comm in closing comm 'cause we only have five minutes . "
A,Task,"We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . "
A,Task,"Um comm you'll be working comm Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design . "
A,Other,"Wait a minute . "
A,Elicit,"Is that right ? "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yep comm "
A,Task,"and um the user interface design comm so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . "
A,Task,"And you'll be evaluating the product . "
A,Minor,"Um comm "
A,Task,"Poppy and Tara will have to work together comm using modelling clay . "
A,Task,"And comm um comm your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Elicit,"So comm anyone else have something to say ? "
B,Other,"Um comm I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Are we "
B,Task,"seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research comm I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something comm "
B,Task,"because even if that may not seem obvious to us comm if that's what the surveys brought out comm I think that we should probably go along with that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development . "
B,Elicit,"But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ? "
D,Minor,"Now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh "
D,Elicit,"are you gonna come up with casing ideas ? "
D,Task,"Like f five different "
B,Task,"Y Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"What I "
A,Task,"five . . "
C,Task,"What I was thinking "
C,Elicit,"what do yous think of this ? "
C,Task,"Um comm having the numbers kind of like comm not a bunch of grapes comm but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Like grapes . "
D,Task,"Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons comm it's true . "
C,Task,"Like that's kind of fruity or something . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"That's just "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We can have a look at those ideas comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well . "
D,Task,"So it's a something that will comm you know comm appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Something that your granny would want on her remote control . "
D,Task,"Um comm and international tastes as well comm so "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Tricky . "
D,Task,"Not easy . "
B,Task,"A lot of things to consider . Hm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Lots of "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Alright . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"And comm um comm we'll reconvene in thirty minutes . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Bye . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Other,"I'll see you later . "
A,Other,"Oh comm what did I just do . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
