A,Task,"as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . "
A,Task,"Um comm we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy comm "
A,Task,"um comm a completely new style comm so that comm um comm can really appeal to a comm to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of comm uh comm channel-changer . "
A,Task,"And comm um comm it needs to be user-friendly for comm um comm maybe comm for an example comm for people that comm um comm can't see the numbers as well comm "
A,Task,"or comm um comm perhaps an ergonomic design . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"So this is a television remote control ? "
A,Task,"Yes comm it's a television remote control . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . "
A,Minor,"So comm alright . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Um comm the way that we're going to go about this is comm um comm we'll have a time where we can comm um come up with new ideas alone comm and comm and work on the project "
A,Task,"and then comm um comm after we've brainstormed and comm and thought about comm we can come together in a meeting and comm and discuss what comm what um comm what kind of functional design we want to use . "
A,Task,"Same with conceptual design and detailed design . "
A,Minor,"So comm um comm "
A,Task,"making sure that it comm it's usable comm "
A,Minor,"that as a comm um "
A,Task,"and that it's comm it's feasible to create comm "
A,Task,"and uh comm to come up with a concept of it want comm what we want it to look like . "
A,Task,"Um comm tool training . "
A,Elicit,"Is comm is everyone comm um "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Got those notes . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Task,"Great . Great . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"One thing that comm uh comm we're going to do is become more acquainted with the comm the tools that we have access to for our project . "
A,Task,"Um comm one of them is our whiteboard . "
A,Task,"And comm um comm as a sort of team-building moment comm um comm I comm I'd like us to comm um comm try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . "
A,Task,"Um comm why that comm why that should be your favourite animal . "
A,Minor,"So comm um comm I comm "
A,Task,"I'm assuming that we should do that now . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"With our microphones still attached to our bodies . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Gosh . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "

A,Task,"Do come up . "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
B,Elicit,"to go first . "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
B,Elicit,"are we all doing it individually ? "
A,Task,"This is a team-building time "
A,Minor,"where comm um comm comm "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"let's stand up and support you "
A,Task,"okay cool comm um "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"My favourite animal comm which changes all the time comm okay comm "
A,Task,"right now it is an elk . "
C,Other,"An elk ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"alright comm so "
C,Minor,"A vicious "
A,Task,"And it goes like "
A,Task,"Yeah it's got like big antlers comm "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Looks kinda like comm like it has holly growing out of its head . "
B,Elicit,"Do you have elk where you come from ? "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Other,"You do . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"We have moose too . "
A,Task,"we have moose and we have deer . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Do you have "
C,Task,"We have sheep . "
B,Task,"Sheep . Yeah comm "
B,Task,"cows . "
A,Minor,"'Kay comm um . "
B,Task,"That's a great elk . "
D,Task,"Uh-oh comm we have a good artist . "
C,Task,"That is really good . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I'm quite "
A,Other,"Thanks . "
A,Minor,"This is my "
D,Other,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"very shapely . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Brilliant . "
A,Task,"That's a sketching of my my elk comm "
A,Task,"and it comm it is my favourite animal right now comm 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature comm "
A,Minor,"that um comm that um "
A,Task,"In a way it looks kind of awkward comm because it's on spindly legs "
A,Minor,"and it uh "
A,Task,"But it can really overcome harsh terrain comm "
A,Task,"and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous comm because it has um strong antlers comm "
A,Minor,"and uh "
A,Task,"it can really combat its enemies comm even like it it's a it's an herbivore but comm uh comm it can really defend itself . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Very nice . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Right comm "
A,Other,"I'm gonna take minutes "
A,Task,"while comm um comm you guys express your favourite animals . "
B,Other,"Okay comm I'll go next . "
B,Task,"I am a big animal lover . "
B,Task,"like all sorts of animals comm but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat comm in memory of my poor cat that died recently . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing comm "
B,Task,"but never mind . "
B,Task,"Not as artistic as Heather's drawing . "
B,Task,"Bit more cartoon style . "
B,Task,"But I like cats because they're so independent comm "
B,Task,"and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . "
B,Task,"Um comm but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable comm 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well comm "
B,Task,"and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and comm um comm running around outside "
B,Task,"as well as being inside comm and enjoying their food comm "
B,Task,"and generally just comm they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing . "
B,Task,"Uh I reckon they're sort of comm they got it sorted . "
B,Task,"They know what they want . "
B,Task,"Basically comm that's why I like cats . "
C,Task,"Very good . "
A,Task,"Great . "
B,Other,"I'll rub that out . "
B,Other,"There you go . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I think my favourite animal would be a dog comm "
C,Task,"but I'm not really sure how to draw one . "
B,Other,"Ooh . "
C,Task,"I comm I've never drawn a dog comm I don't think . "
C,Task,"I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw . "
C,Minor,"Um comm "
A,Elicit,"I forget her name . "
C,Minor,"right "
C,Task,"it's gonna be a really funny dog comm 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog . "
D,Task,"Tara "
D,Task,"or Tara . "
B,Task,"Well there are loads of different types of dogs comm so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . "
C,Task,"It's a cartoon dog I think . "
C,Minor,"A s I don't ev "
C,Other,"Oh comm oh well . "
C,Task,"It's a scary cartoon dog . "
C,Minor,"That This comm "
C,Task,"that does not look like a dog . "
A,Task,"It looks kinda like a person . "
C,Other,"I'm sorry . "
B,Task,"We can pretend . "
D,Task,"That's Pinocchio . "
C,Elicit,"How do you draw a dog ? "
C,Minor,"I suppose it has a lon "
C,Other,"Oh my god . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Yous know what it's supposed to be . "
C,Task,"It's a dog . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,". Um comm I like dogs because comm um comm they're so good to humans comm "
C,Task,"like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs comm "
C,Task,"and they're just such friendly animals . "
C,Task,"And comm like they're more of a companion than cats . "
C,Task,"I've nothing against cats . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
C,Task,"Cats don't really like me comm so I can't like them . "
C,Task,"But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals comm "
C,Task,"that don't look like that . "
D,Other,"Alrighty . "
D,Task,"I feel like a robot . "
D,Minor,"Okay . Um comm "
D,Task,"well I guess I had the most time to think about it . "
D,Other,"I'm going to draw a butterfly comm "
D,Task,"because I saw a butterfly yesterday comm that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . "
D,Task,"And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild comm "
D,Task,"and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . "
D,Task,"It was like comm well it was a little pointier than that . "
D,Task,"At first I thought it was a dead leaf . "
D,Task,"And then it landed on the wall next to me . "
D,Task,"But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . "
D,Minor,"And then it kinda "
D,Task,"there was a green comm I think it was a green ring comm "
D,Task,"and there was like red going out like this . "
A,Task,"It's kinda like a peacock . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it kinda was actually comm "
D,Minor,"'cause it was "
D,Task,"This part of the body was really dull comm and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever comm "
D,Task,"and I'm like comm wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . "
D,Task,"So I thought that was pretty cool . "
D,Task,"And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . "
D,Task,"I wish I'd had my camera . "
D,Task,"So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"There you go . "
B,Task,"Very nice . "
A,Task,"Great . "
D,Minor,"Uh comm what do we "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Elicit,"Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? "
D,Elicit,"Yes I do . "
A,Task,"Yea "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"So comm now that we know how to use the whiteboard comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"um comm the next comm um comm thing we need to address is our financial department comm to meet our our budget comm "
A,Task,"um or not meet our budget but more comm um comm like what kind of comm uh comm selling range we'll be looking at comm "
A,Task,"um comm wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros . "
A,Task,"And so we have to comm um comm come up with a way to comm to create a comm a uh remote control comm where um "
A,Task,"we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . "
A,Task,"Um comm we'd like to comm um to comm uh comm make fifty million Euro . "
A,Task,"I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . "
A,Task,"Um comm and make it for an international market . "
A,Task,"Um comm one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of comm um comm like different kinds of comm uh comm V_C_R_s . "
A,Task,"Things like that comm depending on which country you are . "
A,Task,"Another thing for the design team to think about . "
A,Task,"Um comm we want it to cost comm uh comm absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . "
D,Task,"Okay comm "
D,Elicit,"so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? "
D,Other,"Twelve fifty . "
A,Task,"I'm bad at math . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . Um comm "
A,Task,"so now that comm um comm that is underway comm um "
A,Task,"it is discussion time . "
A,Task,"So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas comm any um suggestions that you may have so far comm "
A,Task,"a um your personal experiences with remote controls comm and um comm um comm areas you see that comm uh comm could be improved in your experience with them . "
A,Elicit,"Does anyone have any initial thoughts ? "
D,Task,"I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"So what's something we could comm uh comm do to remedy that ? "
B,Unlab,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . "
B,Task,"It's always comm where is the remote control ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So maybe if you could have some kind of "
B,Task,"tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . "
B,Task,"I dunno comm "
B,Task,"some kind of alarm . "
B,Task,"You can press a button on your wall comm signal comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea . "
B,Task,"'cause it always gets lost . "
C,Elicit,"Do yous not find that comm um comm like comm there's a lot of comm um comm buttons on your remote control comm and you don't know what half of them do . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that you don't use half of them . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I don't know what they do . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel comm so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"that's comm that's "
D,Task,"That's useful . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it is . Yeah . "
D,Task,"So you just have like the number buttons comm power button comm T_V_ video button . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Elicit,"Anything about comm um comm the look of the comm uh comm remote control that you might have ideas about . "
A,Task,"Maybe it could be comm instead of like a standard rectangular shape comm it could be comm um comm something more interesting like "
A,Task,"Any ideas will do that you have at this point . "
D,Task,"Could be shaped like a conch comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"you know . "
D,Task,"Be like a shell-shaped remote . "
A,Task,"Can hold it . "
B,Task,"A novelty . "
B,Elicit,"Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Like comm I've seen phones like a "
A,Task,"Well if it's a trendy original comm um comm aspect we're going for . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I mean comm you're the designers comm you c comm you can um decide what kind of comm um comm direction you wanna go in comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but at this point in the comm in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I suppose comm if we're he heading to have it comm like make a huge profit out of this comm it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . "
B,Task,"Like comm a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than comm like comm a general kind of more acceptable "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But we don't wanna go towards boring comm 'cause that wouldn't sell either . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So comm hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And the key issue here is comm is being trendy and original . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um comm that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Okay we have five minutes left . "
A,Minor,"So comm just to cover "
A,Task,"We have one more thing . "
A,Task,"Um comm like you can go over your ideas comm of course comm in your own personal times . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um comm our next meeting will be in half an hour . "
A,Task,"So you have half an hour to comm uh comm think about what you want to present . "
A,Task,"Or not present but bring to the meeting . "
A,Elicit,"Um comm I_D_ comm whatever that stands for . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Elicit,"Interface ? "
B,Task,"Industrial Designer . "
A,Other,"Industrial Designer . "
D,Other,"Oh comm industrial . "
B,Task,"That's me . "
A,Other,"I have to remember these things . Um . "
A,Task,"You'll be beginning your comm your working design . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um comm U_I_D_ the technical functions design will comm will be worked on the next thirty minutes . "
A,Task,"Um comm maybe how this can be achieved comm "
A,Task,"and comm um comm we need the user requirements from the manag "
D,Task,"Marketing Expert . "
A,Other,"Marketing Expert . "
A,Task,"Um comm you will get specific instructions comm um comm of what to do in the next half an hour . "
A,Task,"And I'll see you in half an hour comm "
A,Elicit,"okay ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
