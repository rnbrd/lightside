B,Other,"Good morning comm Flores . "
A,Other,"G good morning . "
B,Other,"Marketing Expert . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"Are you ready ? "
A,Task,"You should put the laptop uh right into the square . "
B,Elicit,"For the cameras "
A,Task,"For i for the cameras comm yes . "
B,Task,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Good morning comm Sebastian . "
C,Other,"Good morning comm Mister P_M_ . "
C,Other,"How are you today ? "
A,Other,"I'm fine . "
C,Other,"How was your business trip to Boston ? "
A,Task,"Um well comm actually I didn't go comm didn't feel like it . "
B,Other,"Geez . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Do you want to open it as read-only . "
A,Other,"Um I guess I should close it here . "
B,Task,"You have the same message of uh Windows cannot um "
B,Other,"sen oh stand-by . "
B,Task,"Close the the window . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay comm the waiting is for our Marketing Expert comm Ruud . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"That's right . Ruud . "
A,Other,"Um project kick-off . "
C,Elicit,"Is there a schedule for this meeting ? "
A,Task,"Yes comm there is actually . "
A,Other,"Um I will li list the agenda for today . "
A,Task,"For this meeting . "
A,Other,"Good morning comm Ruud . "
D,Other,"Good morning . "
A,Minor,"Uh it's important um "
C,Other,"I shall close the door . "
A,Task,"yeah comm great . "
A,Task,"It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square comm um for the cameras . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um we're here to develop uh a new product . "
A,Task,"Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um and um "
A,Task,"this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . "
A,Task,"Um you are here in a specific role . "
A,Task,"Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert comm "
A,Task,"Roo is here as the User Interface Designer "
A,Task,"and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . "
A,Elicit,"Is that correct ? "
C,Task,"That's correct . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . "
A,Other,"Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan comm "
A,Task,"uh and we will have a discussion . "
A,Task,"Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes comm "
A,Task,"so we should keep that in mind . "
B,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Um is there any room for a little presentation ? "
C,Task,"Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ? "
A,Task,"There is ? Yeah comm there is . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"No problem . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"this new product we are are g are going to develop comm um "
A,Task,"it's a remote control comm "
A,Task,"a television remote control . "
A,Task,"Um and first of all it should be original comm it should be trendy and user-friendly . "
A,Task,"Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals comm "
A,Task,"um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . "
A,Task,"Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"The market comm we should have a look at the market . "
A,Task,"Um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development comm "
A,Task,"um which consists of three different design stages . "
A,Task,"Uh the functional design comm the conceptual design and the detailed design comm "
A,Task,"um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work comm prepare comm and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the "
A,Task,"the the progressions comm yes . "
B,Task,"Progressions . "
A,Task,"Um the first stage comm the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements comm "
A,Task,"and we will um make a specific uh specification of that . "
A,Task,"Um the second is the technical functional design comm "
A,Task,"um what effect should the remote have ? "
A,Task,"Well in this case control t the the television I think . "
B,Task,"It's for the vision . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um and the last one is the working design . "
A,Task,"How exactly does it work in the technical sense . "
A,Task,"Um the other design stages comm uh we will discuss that later . "
A,Task,"So we'll kop it keep it with the functional design . "
A,Task,"Okay comm um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . "
A,Task,"Um as you see now I can give a presentation . "
A,Task,"Um it's also possible to use this one as well . "
A,Task,"You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"to um presentate comm to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder comm "
A,Task,"which is on your desktop comm "
A,Task,"at least it should be . "
A,Task,"Um then we have this electronic white-board system . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Other,"yeah comm I will show that now . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"you can draw on the board using this pen . "
A,Task,"There are little um uh "
B,Task,"Sensors . "
A,Task,"sensors comm "
A,Task,"so do not grab it here comm "
A,Task,"but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"well comm it "
A,Task,"it's on the um eraser now comm "
A,Task,"so we click the pen button . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so not too fast writing . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . "
A,Task,"It's quite the same . "
A,Task,"Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . "
A,Task,"So do not m make a new file . "
A,Task,"Just use this one uh during the day . "
A,Task,"Um you can use the eraser to make something go away . "
B,Elicit,"But we all use the same white-board file "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Elicit,"So we can work together on it while we're "
B,Elicit,"or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm in the meetings comm only in the meetings . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm alright . Yep . "
A,Task,"Um you can choose the format comm "
A,Minor,"um "
A,Other,"sorry . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Other,"Let me see . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Current colour comm you can choose another colour . "
A,Task,"And um for example black comm "
A,Task,"and you c I can choose the line width . "
A,Task,"Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Quite easy comm "
A,Elicit,"if you uh do have any questions comm just c ask me . "
A,Minor,"Um to um oh well comm I'm "
A,Task,"I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder "
A,Task,"if you want to uh discuss it with us . "
A,Task,"Um as a little training um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Um green . "
D,Minor,"An animal . Okay . Um "
D,Task,"Uh a wee rabbit . "
B,Task,"It's a bunny . "
A,Task,"A rabbit . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Okay comm well great . "
A,Task,"Um Roo comm could you do the same please ? "
B,Other,"But of course comm Flores . "
A,Task,"But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . "
B,Other,"Blank . "
A,Elicit,"Sebastian is thinking about the animal . "
C,Task,"I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I'm think about it too . "
B,Other,"Format . "
B,Task,"Well comm it looked more than a bunny than a cat comm but it works comm "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"It it should be a cat . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay ? "
C,Other,"Well comm I'll give it a try . "
C,Other,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I'm guessing a horse . "
C,Task,"Very good . "
B,Other,"With a very small legs . "
C,Other,"I was very good in drawing . "
B,Other,"You should feed that uh that animal . "
C,Task,"Well comm I guess you uh get the idea . "
A,Task,"Yes comm okay . "
C,Other,"Beautiful . "
A,Other,"Beautiful . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . "
A,Elicit,"Um any questions well comm just just let me know . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"back to our project . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . "
A,Task,"Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros comm "
A,Task,"which is quite a number . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"we uh we will focus this internationally comm "
A,Task,"so the product will be sold um comm if there is market uh interest comm uh in in more than one country . "
A,Task,"And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty comm "
A,Task,"so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development comm "
A,Minor,"um "
A,Task,"because uh comm well comm those are important numbers . "
A,Task,"Um then the discussion comm "
A,Task,"maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . "
C,Other,"Yes comm um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion comm "
C,Task,"because uh there might be some uh "
A,Task,"Limitations . "
C,Task,"influations influences . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Task,"Okay comm great . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um first about my role comm role of the Industrial Designer . "
C,Task,"I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things comm "
C,Task,"and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . "
C,Other,"So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas comm uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions comm "
C,Task,"but uh there might be some impossibilities . "
C,Task,"So that's one . "
C,Other,"Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that comm "
C,Task,"but well comm these are quite the same . "
C,Other,"Sorry about that . "
C,Other,"Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available "
C,Task,"and which might be interesting to implement in our product . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"I have some uh initial ideas about some things "
C,Task,"um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . "
C,Task,"One thing about uh interopera operability . "
C,Task,"Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment . "
C,Task,"Uh for instance comm uh D_V_D_ players comm cell phones comm video and audio equipment . "
C,Task,"So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment . "
B,Elicit,"And for a cell phone ? "
C,Task,"Well comm there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think it could come in handy . "
C,Task,"We should discuss that . "
C,Task,"Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . "
C,Task,"We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore comm so infrared is not uh "
C,Task,"is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . "
C,Task,"But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth . "
B,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but the infrared comm it's uh comm well comm a little bit old-fashioned comm if you would call it like that . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But it's cost-effective . "
B,Task,"But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared comm so "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . Well comm not all comm not all . "
B,Minor,"y you you can "
C,Task,"So that's the point . "
B,Task,"Most of them . "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Or you shou sh use a "
B,Task,"you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . "
C,Task,"Maybe comm "
C,Task,"but that's uh something we should discuss "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and uh about every everybody should think about it . "
C,Task,"So that's just my role comm "
C,Other,"I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input comm "
C,Task,"and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but take these things into account when you start the discussion . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability comm "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Task,"so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment comm "
A,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"and and uh "
C,Task,"and the way of communicating with these equipments . "
A,Task,"Okay . Okay comm good . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"that was your presentation ? "
C,Task,"That's it . "
A,Task,"Okay comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Um okay . Great . Um "
A,Other,"I'll go back to my own presentation . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Mm . Okay . "
A,Task,"Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things . "
A,Task,"Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . "
A,Task,"Um there are other things like um how to make it trendy comm "
A,Task,"which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . "
A,Task,"Um the way how it should be controlled by the user comm "
A,Task,"which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um so let's start with you . "
A,Elicit,"H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ? "
B,Task,"Well comm I had a few uh things in mind . "
B,Task,"Um well comm the interoperability comm just like uh Sebastian said comm "
B,Task,"um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different "
B,Minor,"uh um "
B,Elicit,"Yeah uh comm what is it comm "
B,Task,"devices ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Um so i i "
B,Task,"I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . "
C,Task,"Yes comm I think it should be something like that . "
B,Task,"It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product comm "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"Okay comm so we're we're going business to consumer comm "
A,Minor,"not we're we're it's not a "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I do I don't know that . "
B,Minor,"It's no I have uh "
C,Elicit,"We're not developing this product for a specific vendor comm are we ? "
B,Task,"don't have the information for it . "
A,Task,"No . No . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"we're just developing this product comm and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public comm "
B,Task,"No comm okay . "
C,Task,"so it should fit to every device . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Uh Ruud comm y do you agree ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think I think they're right comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Well comm the techni fu technical function uh what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . "
B,Task,"That's just the basic f technical function . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So that was my really my part for uh this session . "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well comm that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do comm "
B,Task,"wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"It just should change the T_V_'s state . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So that's it . "
B,Minor,"Um but furthermore "
C,Elicit,"And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm with buttons . "
C,Elicit,"Or are there any o other controls ? "
C,Minor,"Are there only any other cont "
B,Task,"Yeah comm or maybe you want a touch-screen or "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward comm sidewords . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"You know these things . "
C,Task,"And um it's very easy for a user to to switch "
B,Task,"They're very vu vulnerable . "
C,Task,"w yes comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"to to switch b uh between uh channels "
C,Task,"or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ comm "
C,Task,"on on a chapters comm you know comm on a D_V_D_ player . "
C,Task,"So maybe that's an idea comm "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And for other user interface I had um comm well comm it's more industrial thing . "
B,Task,"Uh point at a T_V_ comm I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"so you must point everywhere comm "
B,Minor,"so maybe infrared is "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Maybe not even pointed . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm just don't even point it comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
C,Minor,"Uh is that uh "
A,Minor,"Uh "
C,Elicit,"are there restriction for the range comm the operating range too ? "
C,Elicit,"So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm if you g if you go to radio or or yeah . "
B,Task,"For T_V_ comm you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ comm "
B,Task,"so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but if you want to uh get it working with a radio comm and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker comm then maybe the range should be uh "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay comm gentlemen comm um uh just a reminder comm we d we have five minutes left for this meeting "
B,Minor,"But "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"um "
B,Other,"Two more things . "
A,Task,"okay . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um "
B,Task,"you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons comm "
B,Task,"so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand . "
B,Task,"You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever comm I think . "
A,Task,"Okay comm s yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And of course you don't always know where all buttons are comm "
B,Task,"so it should be visible al um in dark too . "
B,Minor,"So when it's dark "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Those are two really uh user interface "
A,Other,"Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . "
B,Task,"Yeah . That's perfect . "
A,Minor,"Is tha "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay comm um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting . "
C,Minor,"Do do you "
A,Elicit,"Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product ? "
A,Elicit,"Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ? "
D,Task,"Uh I think most most things have already been said comm "
D,Task,"like uh control multiple devices . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"And uh comm yeah comm infrared might be an issue . "
A,Elicit,"Because ? "
D,Minor,"Uh well comm he said about n abo "
D,Task,"what he said about pointing . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"But uh lots of devices already use infrared . "
D,Task,"So "
D,Task,"we'll probably have to implement that . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm Sebastian comm did you have any other ideas ? "
C,Task,"Um well yes comm I had comm uh about three minutes ago comm "
C,Task,"but I've seem to forget them forgot them . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"oh yes comm I remember . "
C,Task,"Um you said something about visibility in the dark . "
C,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control comm on which you can see functions ? "
C,Task,"Which makes it easier to operate it . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Well comm maybe I um "
B,Task,"but it it can be quite simple comm "
C,Task,"I I don't know . "
B,Task,"you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"The uh the the digits in black . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Uh then it's already visible in dark . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy "
B,Task,"well comm it can be for design comm of course . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm okay comm "
A,Task,"because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . "
C,Task,"Yes comm but there's a cost limitation too . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Well comm that's more "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"twelve Euro fifty comm yeah . "
C,Task,"So that's a big problem comm I think . "
C,Task,"I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . "
C,Task,"The cost price is very low . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Um "
B,Other,"Just remind something . "
B,Task,"The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade . "
A,Task,"Okay comm okay . "
C,Task,"Okay . Very good point . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"You have a m uh "
B,Task,"Always have s the soft buttons comm always uh clear the the the paint on it . "
B,Task,"The marks . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm um "
A,Other,"I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . "
A,Task,"Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
A,Task,"um or it should not consume too much um power . "
A,Task,"Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or "
B,Minor,"But um "
B,Task,"Necessary comm yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"I dunno comm "
A,Minor,"it's uh "
A,Task,"that's more Sebastian's uh um "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"But then Bluetooth uh might be problem . "
B,Task,"'Cause I think Bluetooth uh "
C,Task,"It's use uh a lot of uh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"Well does it ? "
C,Minor,"well "
B,Task,"I know it from the cell phone . "
A,Task,"I'm not sure . "
C,Task,"Well comm cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and comm well comm it's it seems to work uh quite okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So uh technically it will be possible . "
B,Task,"But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time comm twenty four hours a day . "
C,Task,"No comm you cannot . "
A,Task,"Okay . Gentlemen comm I'm afraid we do not have any more time . "
B,Minor,"Does it "
B,Elicit,"It's over ? "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"so we will go back to our own uh work . "
A,Task,"Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes "
A,Task,"and um comm well comm you know your o your individual actions "
A,Task,"or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Task,"this was it . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"See you in thirty minutes . "
B,Task,"Great . "
