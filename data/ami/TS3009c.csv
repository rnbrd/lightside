D,Task,"But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts . So "
D,Task,"Yeah comm right . "
D,Minor,"The logo "
D,Task,"But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable comm when you get off the front . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I agree . "
D,Task,"But not too big . "
D,Minor,"Just uh "
D,Task,"No no no no . "
D,Task,"Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_ . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Some some kind of wei weight in it . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"So uh a little corner of titanium . "
D,Elicit,"So this this is the exchangeable part . "
D,Task,"Taking all the credit . "
D,Task,"But there's a problem . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Nah that's alright comm that's alright . "
D,Task,"This one is empty . "
D,Task,"You have to empty one huh ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I I don't have a laptop . "
D,Task,"Yeah right . "
D,Task,"It's all about cool things . "
D,Task,"And it will sell . "
D,Task,"We will be rich . "
D,Task,"No man . "
D,Task,"Recalibrate it . "
D,Task,"Finish meeting now . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Oh . "
D,Other,"Alright . Have fun lads . "
D,Task,"but you can scratch it off or something . "
D,Task,"It's better if you have it uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"You have to make this titanium too . "
D,Task,"Like dust in it and so things like that . "
D,Task,"When you exchange all the fronts and it's open . "
D,Task,"you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is . "
D,Task,"Because it has to be uh there all the time you know . "
D,Task,"We can't uh take a blank one . "
D,Elicit,"Or can we ? "
D,Task,"It's not relaxing . "
D,Task,"Dream on . "
D,Task,"You just have to push harder . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Uh door is closed . "
A,Task,"Well comm let's begin . "
A,Task,"Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting comm we'll have to hurry up . "
D,Task,"I'm listening . "
D,Task,"Right . "
A,Other,"Um well I'll start with the presentation again comm the agenda . "
D,Task,"Great . "
A,Other,"Yo . "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"This one I think . "
A,Task,"Uh yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well alright . "
A,Other,"Um well comm I'll show you the notes . "
A,Task,"It's not as uh interesting as it should be "
A,Task,"because we just uh had the meeting comm "
A,Other,"but I'll show them . "
A,Task,"We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Then we'll have to dec decide about the control comm the remote control concepts . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder comm which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . "
A,Task,"So this time we exactly know what to decide about . "
D,Task,"Alright comm great . "
A,Task,"And then we'll close again . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Well these are some examples comm "
A,Task,"but we'll talk about them later . "
A,Task,"We'll first look at your uh presentations . Alright ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Walter will uh start again this time ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm great . "
A,Minor,"Yo . "
D,Task,"Alright comm Trendwatch . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"I will speak about uh latest trends trends comm latest fashion updates comm "
D,Task,"and uh things we must not do . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"Uh the trends . "
D,Task,"It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . "
D,Task,"Uh this because of our last model was very functional comm "
D,Task,"but it uh people didn't like that comm "
D,Task,"so our new mo model must be very good-looking . "
D,Task,"That's uh something you uh have to take a look at . "
C,Other,"Mm-hmm . Alright . "
D,Task,"And uh the feeling has to be very great . "
D,Task,"Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Task,"Um there's a minus uh two times here comm because this is the most important point . "
D,Task,"This is uh two times as less important comm "
A,Task,"Less . "
D,Task,"and uh same for this one . "
D,Task,"Um comm technological technological innovations comm that's uh regarded very highly too . "
D,Task,"Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen comm uh speech uh acknowledgement comm as we uh talked about earlier . "
A,Minor,"Well comm yeah . "
D,Task,"So we have to have uh something like that comm "
D,Minor,"like we uh "
A,Task,"L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts . "
D,Task,"Right . "
D,Task,"Uh the last point is easy to use . "
D,Task,"Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . "
D,Elicit,"I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that . "
C,Other,"Easy to use ? "
A,Task,"Well comm easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh "
D,Task,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"I think that's your ta "
A,Task,"Functional is not an issue comm and then easy to use . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I know . "
A,Task,"Well we have to choose one of them . "
D,Task,"I think we have to go for the first one . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It's the most important one . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So we have to uh take that one . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So it it it isn't very important that that it works easy . "
B,Task,"Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . "
D,Task,"But it has to look great . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"We'll we'll look at uh . "
D,Task,"We'll see . "
C,Minor,"You "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm yeah comm "
C,Task,"you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway comm "
C,Task,"so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm right . "
D,Task,"But the most important thing is that it looks great "
D,Task,"and people say wow comm that's real great uh great concept . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Minor,"Uh these are the new colours of this year . "
D,Task,"So it must be very bright comm very colourful . "
D,Task,"People like this . "
D,Task,"So we we have to think uh in this direction . "
D,Task,"So i set your mind to it . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"Findings ? Fashion update ? "
D,Task,"Fruit and vegetables are cool . "
D,Task,"I am told . "
C,Task,"Uh you think ? "
D,Task,"The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . "
D,Task,"So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm well "
B,Task,"Bananas . "
D,Task,"Uh furthermore uh material comm that's your part comm should be very strong . "
D,Task,"I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it comm "
D,Task,"maybe in a colour or something comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"that looks so f really flashy "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"but it it is also strong . "
D,Task,"And that's uh also for the younger public . "
A,Minor,"B "
A,Task,"Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . "
A,Task,"Th this year it's fruits "
A,Task,"but next year it's it's something totally different . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's great . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"So it looks very heavy "
D,Task,"but you can still uh use it very easily . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yep comm alright . "
D,Task,"Well comm the don'ts . "
D,Task,"Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . "
D,Task,"Well we don't want uh older people comm "
D,Task,"we want young people . "
D,Task,"So uh we're gonna turn that around . "
D,Task,"We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Elicit,"Right ? "
A,Task,"Wood is popular . Aha . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"We don't want wood . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm among the old people comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"Old people . "
D,Task,"So comm that's it for me . "
A,Other,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Nice comm uh well show us . "
C,Task,"Right comm I am going to tell you something about the components design . "
C,Task,"Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . "
C,Task,"This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . "
C,Task,"And the materials ? Um I have heard several things comm "
C,Other,"so I uh I'll have to change that on the way . "
C,Task,"But uh the case ? "
C,Task,"Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . "
C,Task,"But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm we should change that . "
C,Task,"It should feel strong . "
C,Task,"So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . "
C,Minor,"We should move to uh something "
A,Task,"Well maybe it it it is comm "
A,Task,"but it doesn't look strong . "
A,Minor,"So maybe "
C,Task,"Well yeah . "
C,Task,"Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough comm "
C,Task,"but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So "
D,Task,"No no no . "
A,Task,"But we still have to look at our price of course . "
A,Task,"Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Also "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But we'll return to that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Uh the buttons of course rubber comm "
C,Task,"I think everyone agrees . "
C,Task,"And electrical cables comm copper is all pretty basic stuff . "
C,Task,"The chips made of silicon comm I guess . "
C,Task,"I think that's the best uh way to do it . "
C,Task,"And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb . "
C,Task,"Then I've uh had a few findings comm made a few findings . "
C,Task,"Uh the target audience product style . "
C,Task,"Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like comm as you said comm uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . "
C,Task,"They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . "
C,Task,"But of course that's not our uh things this . "
C,Task,"So this is things we must not do . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people comm "
C,Task,"which is of course our uh group comm "
C,Task,"the people we aim at . "
C,Task,"Um under forty five years old . "
C,Task,"Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . "
C,Task,"Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said comm "
C,Task,"that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . "
D,Minor,"Mm . Yeah . "
C,Task,"But they like soft materials comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"uh so we might uh we have to consider that . "
C,Task,"And also they like curved round shapes . "
C,Task,"So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . "
C,Task,"And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here comm that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices comm gaming devices comm should define the characteristics of the device . "
C,Task,"But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device comm so we don't really have to consider that . "
A,Task,"Sports uh comm they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh "
B,Task,"Soccer fronts . Mm . "
A,Minor,"Huh ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"That's nice . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Well I also have um several examples of uh styles comm "
A,Minor,"All the results ? "
D,Task,"We keep coming back to the fronts . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It was not very uh interesting uh comm "
C,Task,"very classical looking comm "
C,Task,"but that's n that's not what we want . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Nai . Uh no . "
C,Task,"We have these kind of things . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"I don't know what exactly they are . "
C,Minor,"It looks like "
C,Task,"Well you know uh you recognise the shapes comm "
C,Task,"it's very primary colours comm uh bright colours and uh round shapes . "
C,Task,"You also uh see uh this device comm it's not very round and "
D,Task,"Fruity . Fruity . "
C,Task,"Fruity of course . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm it uh "
A,Task,"It's t terrible . "
C,Task,"That's true . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"And uh well round shapes comm primary colours . "
C,Task,"You can see it all here . "
C,Task,"And of course uh this famous device . "
A,Minor,"Hmm ? "
C,Task,"I think as you know something uh some devices like this . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm alright . "
C,Minor,"So to give you an idea of uh "
D,Task,"Well it's got a strong look comm this . Yeah . "
C,Task,"This has a strong look . "
C,Task,"Although it's plastic comm it's it's grey to to to give it iron look . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it still has a strong look . "
A,Task,"Yeah . And it's round . "
C,Minor,"That's uh "
D,Task,"But then you are losing your fruity colours . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well we have to make a "
A,Task,"Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . "
D,Task,"That's true . "
A,Task,"So uh those kind of things you can you can combine . "
C,Task,"Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . "
C,Task,"I don't think that's very practical comm "
C,Task,"but But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour . "
A,Task,"No comm it isn't . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking comm it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . "
D,Minor,"Yeah but the "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"'Cause if you look at this comm it it doesn't look very very strong comm "
C,Task,"becau But this is plastic comm and and this too comm but "
D,Task,"But it doesn't have to look strong . "
D,Task,"The the results are comm the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . "
C,Other,"The feel ? "
D,Task,"The feel . "
C,Minor,"Uh alright . "
C,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"So comm if you ti "
B,Task,"And it it doesn't have to be strong comm also . "
A,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"Nah yeah the feel "
A,Minor,"You you "
B,Task,"Only the feel . "
A,Task,"Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . "
A,Task,"So it it looks pretty but it feels strong . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"I agree . "
C,Task,"And I Then I have some more findings . Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device comm "
C,Task,"uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . "
C,Task,"I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . "
C,Task,"But solar energy is not very practical inside a house comm "
C,Task,"because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun . "
C,Task,"And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical comm I think comm for uh for a simple remote comm "
C,Task,"that's a bit comm oh comm that's a bit uh That's a bit uh much . "
A,Task,"No titanium . "
C,Task,"And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . "
C,Task,"Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . "
C,Task,"That that's the information I received . "
C,Task,"If you use the curved case comm uh a curved case comm double curved then you can't use titanium . "
A,Elicit,"What do you exactly mean with double curved ? "
C,Task,"Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . "
C,Task,"And uh now the the shape comm yeah comm a curved case . "
C,Task,"Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . "
C,Task,"Uh a more modern look not plain comm long box style comm but "
A,Other,"Double curved ? "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"It it mean "
C,Other,"I'll draw it comm "
C,Other,"but maybe later . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm well okay . "
C,Task,"And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape comm than if you have uh . "
C,Minor,"Um anyway "
C,Task,"Um f as uh for the buttons comm simple push buttons . "
C,Task,"No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that comm "
C,Task,"because it makes more complex and expensive . "
C,Task,"And comm uh as we agreed comm we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device . "
D,Minor,"Yeah right . "
C,Task,"Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . "
C,Task,"But we do use an L_C_D_ screen comm "
C,Task,"so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip comm "
C,Task,"which is more complex and expensive . "
C,Task,"But It's worth the trouble I think comm "
A,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material . "
C,Minor,"because "
B,Task,"Because people like that . "
A,Other,"This soft material thing from uh Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh rubber is a soft material comm I guess . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Right . "
C,Task,"Uh soft enough . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Right . Yeah . "
C,Task,"So that's uh basically what I want to talk about . "
A,Minor,"Alright . Okay . "
A,Task,"We will take that . "
A,Task,"And then uh Mike ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . "
B,Task,"Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . "
B,Task,"Um we must decide where comm this meeting . "
B,Task,"Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems comm "
B,Task,"um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . "
B,Task,"And um well they're cheap comm "
B,Task,"so we could use them now . "
A,Other,"Oh "
B,Task,"Um it's not really speech recognition comm "
A,Task,"That's interesting . "
B,Task,"it's more um like you can um talk to the chip comm uh record the message and record an answer comm "
B,Task,"and then once you uh talk to the remote comm then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . "
B,Task,"So if I say hi Mike comm and you have recorded uh hi Mike back comm then you will get that . "
C,Other,"Oh comm yeah comm I understand . Yeah . "
D,Other,"Oh okay . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . But you can also say that comm when you say something comm it does some function . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"No it doesn't does not do anything . "
D,Minor,"No . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
B,Minor,"But i it's just a "
A,Minor,"That's a bit uh "
D,Task,"But that that makes it cheap . "
D,Task,"It's it's just a an extra function comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah it's it's cheap . "
A,Other,"Yes . I understand . "
D,Task,"and it's cheap . "
A,Task,"But it has no functionality for our remote at all . "
D,Minor,"No but "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"but that's the gadget they want comm or the gimmicks . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm right . "
C,Task,"But it it's n nice for young people . "
D,Task,"Young people love them . "
B,Task,"Yes comm we we should really uh include that one comm I think . Um "
C,Task,"They like gadgets . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm ple "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"If it's cheap . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Well comm as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . "
B,Task,"Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff "
B,Task,"um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen comm uh instead of uh extra buttons . "
A,Elicit,"So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ? "
B,Task,"I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . "
B,Task,"Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a comm well comm conventional remote comm I think . "
B,Task,"For the learnability "
B,Task,"and uh well to keep it recognisable . "
B,Task,"A voice recognition can be uh implemented . "
B,Task,"And uh I drew an example comm "
B,Task,"but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"Can you draw it now of uh "
D,Minor,"How How "
B,Other,"Hmm ? "
C,Task,"Can you draw it now ? "
A,Minor,"Ah . "
B,Other,"Well I have the I can draw it again comm "
B,Task,"and I know what I did wrong . "
B,Task,"I didn't tick the note bo box in the . Um "
C,Minor,"Mm . Alright . "
D,Elicit,"How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ? "
B,Task,"Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the "
D,Other,"Alright . "
D,Task,"So you have a menu button comm "
D,Task,"and then you can go up and down . "
B,Other,"Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . "
A,Task,"But then we should also have an uh an Okay button . "
D,Task,"Yeah right . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Other,"Um I shall draw this . If it uh works . "
C,Minor,"button comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Just uh "
A,Elicit,"There is already a blank . Yes ? "
A,Minor,"So Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm so have I . "
B,Task,"Nah . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Task,"You have to push hard . "
C,Task,"I suggest a banana shape . "
C,Task,"Because of the fruity uh fashion . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"m Next year that's out . "
C,Task,"Yellow and "
C,Other,"Yeah alright comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Just a hunch . "
B,Task,"Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? "
B,Task,"Yeah just uh the numbers . "
C,Elicit,"And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? "
B,Task,"These these will be bigger in the the real design . "
C,Other,"Alright comm yeah . "
B,Task,"This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And with this you can uh comm yes comm go to through the menus "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"and that can "
B,Task,"Um the video button should be uh an apart button comm "
D,Minor,"You've "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"because you want it to uh t comm yeah comm to use it fast within one uh click . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"And what's the menu button ? "
D,Task,"And you you need a you need a speaker . "
B,Minor,"Um it's "
D,Minor,"For the "
B,Other,"Hmm ? "
B,Task,"This button can also be the Menu button comm we use in the menus "
A,Elicit,"But how did How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well we we can add another button here comm but "
A,Task,"Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh "
C,Task,"Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . "
C,Task,"By pressing the menu button again comm you go uh out . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works . "
A,Minor,"Yes comm well but "
A,Task,"bec because when you push Menu you get in comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah ? Yeah ? "
A,Task,"and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . "
B,Other,"Ah right . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well you you "
C,Task,"But you can men you can press menu again to get out . "
A,Task,"Well that's also the Okay button . "
A,Minor,"That's you you should have uh "
B,Task,"No no comm "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button "
B,Task,"and this the Okay button . "
A,Task,"Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out . "
D,Task,"Exit . "
A,Task,"Exit . "
B,Task,"Ah once you have an extra Menu button comm you don't need that that extra option . "
A,Task,"Well comm it's just a choice . "
B,Task,"You have uh redundancy . "
D,Task,"But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . "
D,Minor,"Or don't "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"if we decide to uh to implement that comm maybe we should . "
C,Elicit,"Why would you put it uh then comm "
C,Elicit,"and where is the recording uh the microphone ? "
C,Elicit,"Where would you put it ? "
B,Task,"Well they that could be anywhere . "
B,Task,"That's very small . "
B,Task,"It could be uh down here . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"Um . Well comm not here . "
B,Task,"I yeah I suggest here . "
B,Task,"But that's just a little gap . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right comm "
D,Task,"and spea speaker at the back comm or something . "
C,Task,"Microphone comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Well the speaker and the microphone comm I think comm are the same uh little hole thingy . "
C,Other,"Yeah I understand . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh but uh we could uh d do comm but it's perhaps more expensive comm uh the speaker on the back or something . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
B,Minor,"Well i "
B,Task,"Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines comm "
B,Task,"so they won't be uh very expensive . But "
A,Minor,"Huh ? "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"Yeah ? Okay . "
B,Task,"This is my suggested design . "
A,Minor,"Well comm okay comm alright . "
B,Minor,"Um Yes . "
A,Task,"Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . "
B,Task,"And oh I think as you can see so comm the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end comm or at the bottom . "
A,Task,"I'd I agree . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm fine . "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"Fine . "
D,Task,"Move on . "
C,Task,"Well yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Oh comm um I had some uh examples . "
C,Task,"I can live with it . "
B,Minor,"You can uh "
A,Task,"Yes ? "
B,Task,"But I did not like it very much comm but "
B,Task,"Well these are quite obvious comm very ugly remote . Um "
A,Task,"Too big . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"They do they don't look fruity enough . "
D,Task,"Nei They're n they're not trendy . "
B,Minor,"No comm well th "
A,Task,"They're all black . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well not all . "
A,Task,"Hey comm that one I like . "
B,Task,"Uh this is for children but th "
C,Minor,"Tho Yeah those "
D,Task,"It doesn't look strong . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"But it doesn't uh the "
B,Task,"W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to . "
A,Other,"The remote . "
D,Minor,"Yeah right . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm ok Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well this is a terrible "
A,Task,"Terrible . "
D,Task,"This is just crazy . "
A,Task,"It's it's all too much buttons . "
B,Minor,"Um this looks "
C,Task,"But it it must not look too childish of course huh ? "
A,Task,"Too many buttons . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"That's "
B,Task,"This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . "
B,Task,"I think we should comm if it's um possible comm uh one with colours comm but "
D,Task,"Nah th It's too expensive . "
B,Minor,"I don't know uh "
A,Task,"Well comm that's too expensive I think . "
B,Other,"Too expensive ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Alright . "
B,Minor,"Well Nah . "
C,Minor,"But it Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Alright . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Ha comm even more . N "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Minor,"Mm no . "
D,Elicit,"But are we going for a strange uh form ? "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"No comm not very strange . "
D,Task,"'Cause people like that . "
C,Task,"Not not too strange . No . "
D,Task,"Not too strange . "
D,Task,"You can make the the underside comm you can make it more round comm where the L_C_D_ is . "
A,Minor,"It still has t "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Th "
A,Task,"a a kind of bridge . "
A,Task,"So it f falls over the hand . "
D,Task,"I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone comm with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms comm s something like that . "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"Yeah ? Yeah ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"You know ? "
A,Task,"Well I have at home a remote with a bridge . "
A,Task,"It's just a half round half half circle at "
A,Task,"And then it falls exactly over the hand comm "
A,Task,"and that's very nice . "
A,Task,"That's It feels comfortable . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but people like something uh new you know . "
C,Task,"Exotic yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm different . "
C,Minor,"We have t "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"I will design it comm we design it later . "
D,Minor,"Y yis "
C,Task,"So we'll get to that later I guess . "
D,Minor,"Alright . Great . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm alright . "
A,Elicit,"Um where did I put it ? "
C,Minor,"The specific shape . The "
A,Task,"Um conceptual phase comm I think this is it . "
A,Task,"I got this from our friends . "
A,Task,"So Uh yeah the conceptual design . "
C,Other,"Our sources . "
A,Task,"These are a few examples which we have to decide about . "
A,Task,"All the the materials from the case comm uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story . "
A,Minor,"Um "
D,Other,"Your bag . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um now from the user interface comm your uh package ? "
A,Minor,"Um where "
A,Task,"No well comm that's more like the buttons where they have to come . "
A,Task,"And um B a bit of comm yeah well comm a bit of uh design . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm this is what we've just done . Right ? "
C,Task,"But uh we should decide now . "
A,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Task,"but we have to decide about these now . "
B,Other,"Ah right . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Materials are the most comm most impor "
A,Task,"And uh the trend-watching . "
A,Task,"So as you said comm fruity is in comm "
A,Task,"well sells good . "
A,Other,"Wow . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh these things . "
C,Elicit,"So we have to uh put it in one uh document . "
A,Task,"Uh yes . "
A,Task,"Um so if we uh go through them "
C,Task,"Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document comm "
C,Unlab,"and then uh put the answers after the subjects . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Not everything . "
C,Task,"Well we have to decide all these things ? "
B,Task,"Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine . "
A,Minor,"Yeah well uh "
C,Task,"W we can uh override them ? "
A,Minor,"Why should I uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Well a case ? Uh that's me . "
C,Minor,"Uh I suggest "
C,Elicit,"Well what do I suggest actually ? "
A,Elicit,"What what kind of properties should it have ? "
A,Task,"Well we just listened . "
B,Minor,"I think we "
C,Task,"Uh s solid comm "
C,Task,"yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Why don't we um use uh titanium "
B,Task,"or or a hard comm yeah comm some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front . "
D,Minor,"Do you know the new uh "
B,Minor,"That "
B,Task,"Just like um most cell phones are . "
C,Other,"Yeah comm I understand . "
D,Minor,"No no "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So we have titanium . "
D,Task,"The front is the most important . "
C,Task,"Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote comm so not the front comm could be titanium comm "
C,Task,"to give that uh strong look . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"You know what ? "
C,Task,"And then the front is made of plastic . "
C,Task,"And you can put that on and off comm "
C,Task,"and switch it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But the feel of plastic isn't strong . "
C,Task,"No but you have titanium of course . "
B,Minor,"No but you you have this "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh you have the best of both worlds . "
D,Task,"Yeah alright comm alright . 'Kay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you have the re remote in your hand like this . "
B,Task,"So you feel titanium . "
C,Task,"And of course comm yeah comm you have the the the plastic front end . "
C,Task,"But you also have the titanium . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah of course comm "
C,Task,"but yeah you have to make a decision . "
B,Task,"And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but it it's expensive . "
C,Task,"I guess so . "
C,Minor,"Uh titanium I sh I think uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Bendable . "
C,Other,"Huh ? "
D,Task,"Bendable . "
C,Minor,"Well comm well the "
B,Task,"Well any colour "
C,Task,"According to my sources comm uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available comm and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it comm if we want . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"then you you paint it in the colour you want it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"The plastic is is the colour you want it . "
D,Task,"Paint spray . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah alright . "
B,Minor,"So Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Elicit,"we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? "
A,Minor,"I've uh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I think that's a nice trade-off . "
A,Task,"Titanium back comm plastic front . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um well I am going to put it in here comm "
A,Task,"uh because we can uh look . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm great . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I Um solid feel and trendy look . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Elicit,"So material comm um hard plastic "
C,Task,"Yeah comm for the front "
A,Task,"for the front ? "
C,Task,"and then titanium for the back . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"For the non-removable uh part . "
D,Task,"But then you have the problem comm when you have a titanium back comm you can't switch it . "
D,Task,"When you want an other colour on the front comm it doesn't match . "
C,Minor,"Well but "
D,Minor,"You know ? "
B,Task,"Well titanium is neutral . "
C,Minor,"The titan titanium isn't isn't v very "
C,Task,"Yeah comm i it doesn't uh curves . "
C,Minor,"No uh I nei . Titanium is very "
D,Other,"I understand . "
C,Other,"No no no comm "
C,Task,"but you know b Titanium is very basic colour comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Elicit,"I dunno if if you disagree comm "
B,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"but I think it's doesn't matter very much . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Alright . "
B,Task,"Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours comm "
B,Task,"and they don't use uh wood . "
C,Task,"And even if it does uh doesn't match comm it will uh People like mm colours that don't match . "
D,Task,"Funky customers . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"Okay . And well "
A,Task,"the the electrical cable is just normal uh . "
C,Task,"Cop copper uh material . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Excuse me ? "
B,Minor,"The electrical cable uh does "
A,Task,"It's uh from uh our coffee uh "
C,Task,"Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh "
B,Task,"No we don't use an electrical cable . "
B,Task,"Yeah inside comm "
B,Task,"but this is for the coffee uh machine . "
C,Minor,"Yeah in "
C,Task,"Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh "
A,Task,"Of course . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but that's not what's meant here comm I think . "
D,Task,"Nei . "
D,Task,"So external . "
C,Other,"Oh external ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well A coffee grind doesn't have "
C,Task,"Na ja . Never mind the coffee grind . "
A,Minor,"Well uh "
A,Task,"all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Right ? "
A,Task,"The chip is normal silicon . "
A,Task,"Uh the buttons are normal comm etcetera . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
C,Task,"Alright . Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So that's just easy . "
A,Task,"Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes . "
A,Task,"The conceptual specification of the user interface ? "
A,Task,"Um well we have our beautiful drawing . "
B,Task,"Well I got a better one here "
B,Minor,"and I will um "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Elicit,"Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder comm "
B,Other,"The shared folder . "
A,Other,"and then I'll put it in our end report . "
B,Other,"I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting . "
A,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Minor,"you can "
A,Task,"Mm yeah . You can uh put some uh which button is what . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um "
A,Task,"the trend-watching "
A,Minor,"included these days . "
A,Minor,"And what do we ? "
A,Task,"We thing that fruit and bright colours are "
C,Minor,"Yeah the the the front w "
D,Task,"I think we can launch a couple of packages . "
D,Task,"You can buy a different kind of of of machine comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"but it's the same thing comm but with another front . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"that's the whole idea of the front . "
D,Minor,"And you can you can "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh those kind of things . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yeah right . "
B,Task,"But that's for later on . "
B,Task,"The fronts y you can do anything with them . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini "
B,Other,"Yeah comm right "
B,Task,"For the uh initiative uh launch . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"For the for the launch comm yeah . "
D,Task,"It's good marketing . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Launch different lines at once . "
C,Task,"So e th then a c couple of basic colours . "
C,Minor,"Not not very uh sim Not "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"n not too heavy . "
D,Task,"You can always take another pick . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time . "
D,Task,"They have to buy it later on . "
B,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Come on . "
D,Task,"More basic . "
A,Task,"We still have to make those fifty million comm yeah ? . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Very boring comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so comm "
C,Task,"The most boring fronts possible . "
A,Task,"The most ugly . "
B,Task,"so that they can uh experiment with it "
B,Task,"and that they want more . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm right . "
A,Task,"Two . "
C,Task,"Yeah but you you can have some basic colours comm "
C,Task,"and then we come with the special patterns on them comm "
B,Task,"Red red comm blue and green you give them or something comm "
C,Minor,"and and uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And uh "
B,Task,"and then you can give them uh other ones . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Alright . "
A,Task,"Um well the buttons etcetera comm we get from Mike . "
A,Task,"Uh this fruit and bright colours comm "
A,Task,"yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour comm we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch comm when we uh well introduce our remote . "
C,Task,"Uh we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design . "
C,Task,"Because yeah we have the sketch but "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Else it w won't sell . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Other,"Alright comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well I'll have to comm "
A,Task,"before I get another warning for five minutes comm I'm going to get "
A,Elicit,"Where is my mouse ? "
A,Elicit,"Uh where is my mouse ? "
D,Other,"Lost my mouse . "
A,Other,"Oh yeah . "
A,Task,"Um this is it . "
D,Task,"Unbelievable . "
A,Task,"Well comm um this we have . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh basic stuff . "
A,Task,"Interface we have . Supplements comm L_C_D_ . "
A,Task,"Maybe a a cheap voice recording . "
A,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"Yeah we should do that . "
C,Other,"The price ? "
A,Minor,"Yes . Alright . "
A,Task,"Individual actions . "
C,Task,"We all agree on that . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Industry designer comm . User Interface comm Mike . You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Other,"we can do that . "
C,Elicit,"Together or uh "
C,Task,"Yeah together . "
D,Task,"Yeah togeth "
C,Minor,"How "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah comm but how do I "
A,Task,"That's what I got uh to hear . "
B,Task,"But bu we stay we stay here or something ? "
A,Task,"Yes "
A,Task,"well we'll get it to hear that I think . "
A,Task,"But I think so . "
A,Task,"Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it "
D,Task,"You can take the SMARTboard . "
B,Minor,"Ah right . "
A,Task,"This is the SMARTboard comm so "
B,Task,"And take it to our rooms "
B,Minor,"and uh "
A,Task,"Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype comm "
A,Task,"and y Well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera . "
B,Other,"Ah comm "
B,Task,"specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So you'll get it on your em on your laptop . "
A,Task,"Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project "
D,Other,"Have fun . "
C,Task,"Some Some non functional tasks . "
A,Task,"yeah project evaluation . "
A,Minor,"So um "
D,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"comm what are you going to do ? "
A,Task,"Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means comm "
A,Task,"but uh you'll get uh the specifications . "
D,Task,"We don't have produ product yet comm "
D,Task,"so kind of difficult . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"That's why I uh "
A,Minor,"But uh "
C,Other,"You're fired . "
C,Minor,"No but "
A,Elicit,"How long do we still have ? "
C,Task,"Well comm can we talk about something else ? Uh "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh no I don't know anything comm "
C,Elicit,"but maybe uh anyone else uh "
B,Other,"Yeah . Um "
D,Minor,"Ajax . Nah . "
C,Task,"Yeah ? "
B,Elicit,"Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? "
D,Task,"Um round . "
C,Task,"Round I think . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Round . "
B,Task,"Yeah I I I also uh thought Yeah . "
C,Task,"To make it as uh as round as possible . "
B,Task,"And these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped "
A,Minor,"Why does "
D,Task,"Curvy . Yeah . "
D,Task,"So you can see you have to up or down . "
B,Task,"with a square one in the middle . "
A,Other,"Ah f fuck you . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"But now I see the "
D,Task,"And this must be uh volume I think comm "
A,Other,"Heh ? "
D,Task,"and this programme . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Well most of the time uh up and down is programme "
A,Minor,"We can't get "
B,Task,"and left and right are volume comm I think . "
C,Task,"Well th th th th th that depends uh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it depends comm but "
C,Minor,"Well we uh "
B,Task,"If you turn up the volume comm you always see this thingy go up . "
C,Minor,"We we j we'll just give them an uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
C,Other,"We'll design it comm "
C,Task,"and then they can give comments on it . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah alright . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
A,Minor,"Ts "
A,Task,"It doesn't work any more . "
A,Task,"We can't save them . "
A,Task,"So we'll just have them uh standing there . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I noticed . "
D,Task,"You can't uh click the corners . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"It's a bit uh bit a pity . "
D,Task,"It's a real real great thing . "
A,Task,"Well we still have uh more than five minutes . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"what are we going to do ? "
A,Task,"I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue . "
D,Task,"Let's start the design . "
A,Task,"Oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote . "
C,Task,"Well yeah . Um I think um a logo comm our company logo comm and the slogan should be or could be "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"Also the slogan ? On the "
C,Task,"Yeah comm why not ? "
C,Task,"If there's enough space comm you can put uh "
B,Task,"Uh I I'd say only the logo . "
C,Minor,"We'll we'll "
D,Minor,"O "
D,Task,"Yeah . Me too . "
B,Task,"Too much text and it gets too too busy . "
C,Task,"Well comm our slogan is not very long . "
C,Minor,"It's just a simple "
C,Elicit,"What is it ? "
B,Task,"Well it's quite a long phrase . "
A,Task,"We put the fashion in electronics . "
A,Task,"We put the fashion in electronics . "
C,Minor,"You c "
C,Task,"But you can put it on the back comm "
C,Task,"on the titanium part . "
C,Task,"The logo and the and the "
B,Task,"Ah the logo should be on the top I think . "
A,Task,"On the top . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well in in in the right top corner ? "
C,Task,"Yeah they do . Well yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Right corner comm yes . "
A,Minor,"And well you c "
C,Task,"Right corner comm "
A,Task,"On the back comm you can put uh h At the bottom comm you can put the logo with the "
C,Task,"or maybe here in the middle ? "
B,Task,"uh the text ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Just just small . "
B,Task,"Uh yeah comm at the back ? "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"it it should be hard on the on the on the board comm "
B,Minor,"Well you c Well uh Yes . "
A,Minor,"Yeah well "
C,Task,"and you can remove the front . "
B,Minor,"You can "
B,Task,"The logo can be on on every uh front . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something . "
A,Task,"Carved into the material . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"you you can carve it into the titanium at the back . "
C,Task,"I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing . "
C,Elicit,"But am I the only one comm or uh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm on the backside . "
A,Task,"Well comm management would like it . "
B,Task,"Well n n not not on the front side comm I think . "
A,Task,"The front side comm no no l no slogan . "
C,Task,"No not on the front comm "
C,Task,"but on the backside . Uh "
B,Task,"On the back Yes comm you you can comm yeah comm push that in comm "
A,Minor,"Sorry . "
B,Task,"so that it is always be there . "
C,Task,"I think it's a nice idea comm to make it more recognisable comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"that the next to the logo you have the slogan . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"To make more uh of an impression . "
C,Task,"Not too big . No comm "
C,Task,"very small . "
C,Task,"Not on the entire back comm "
C,Task,"but uh just very small . "
C,Task,"But readable enough of course . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Yes comm slogan from company on the back with logo "
C,Task,"But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design . "
B,Task,"Yeah I think over here the logo . "
C,Task,"Lo Uh yeah . "
C,Task,"Or maybe here in the middle comm "
C,Task,"but we'll decide later . "
A,Other,"and logo also on the front "
A,Other,"but not exchange uh Uh ? Hmm ? Uh when changing fronts . "
A,Task,"Alright comm that's decided . "
C,Task,"Do you do you see a bit of the of the um of the uh titanium ? O on the front ? "
A,Task,"Five minutes left . "
C,Task,"Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium comm "
B,Task,"Yes "
B,Minor,"we could "
C,Task,"the front is the the upper part comm "
C,Task,"and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen . So "
A,Elicit,"So a bit of titanium between ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"No no betwe "
C,Other,"of between "
A,Task,"That's a bit Oh that that's that's pretty cool . "
C,Task,"we can do "
C,Task,"but But then you have two parts of front comm two fronts that "
B,Task,"No comm they have two fronts comm "
B,Minor,"that . You you can "
A,Other,"No ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"This enti entire bottom ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
