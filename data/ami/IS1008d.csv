B,Other,"I'm sorry to be late . "
A,Other,"Welcome back . "
A,Other,"Welcome back everybody . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Thanks . "
A,Task,"So this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting . "
A,Task,"And uh opening and uh P_M_s of the meet minutes comm "
A,Task,"uh prototype presentation from uh Christine and uh Agnes . "
B,Task,"Agnes comm yes . "
A,Minor,"Yes "
A,Task,"and uh evaluation criteria . "
A,Task,"The finance comm it's uh from my side comm from the management comm "
A,Task,"and uh production evaluation . Then uh closing . "
A,Task,"So we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further comm okay comm "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"Okay comm let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype . "
C,Other,"Mm comm okay . "
A,Task,"So I handle to "
C,Task,"I've done a presentation comm "
C,Task,"but it pretty much covers work that we've both done comm "
C,Task,"so if I'm missing anything comm Christine can just correct me . "
A,Other,"So shall I go to "
B,Other,"Uh thank you comm "
A,Other,"sorry . "
B,Other,"so you did a PowerPoint presentation comm good for you . "
A,Minor,"Yep . S "
A,Other,"Okay comm let's go to A_M_I_ . "
C,Task,"It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world comm but "
A,Elicit,"So in two or three or "
C,Task,"Three . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
C,Minor,"No it's "
D,Other,"Probably . Technical pa I would think . "
C,Task,"think it's the last one . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"then this is "
C,Task,"the la yeah comm that one comm final design . "
D,Minor,"Ha . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It is named appropriately comm you just couldn't see the name . "
C,Elicit,"Um okay comm can I have the mouse ? "
A,Other,"Yes . "
C,Other,"Thanks . "
C,Minor,"Alright comm so "
C,Task,"from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting comm we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape comm "
C,Task,"the material that we chose was wood comm "
C,Task,"and uh the colour would be customisable comm "
C,Task,"'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . "
C,Minor,"Um comm "
C,Task,"so in terms of function comm you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off comm volume and channel control comm menu control comm voice recognition control comm "
C,Task,"and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design comm "
C,Task,"if we figure out it's too expensive comm well then you just take it off . "
C,Minor,"Um comm so "
C,Other,"to unveil our lovely product . "
C,Task,"This is our remote control comm with the flip panel as you can see . "
C,Task,"So if you lift up the panel comm you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . "
C,Task,"Um comm this is actually hard to do . "
C,Task,"The yellow button you have is the on off button comm "
C,Task,"so it's really big comm hard to miss . "
C,Task,"You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . "
C,Other,"So up volume up comm down volume down . "
C,Task,"The green are the channel changing . "
C,Task,"S And it's one of those very light comm very touchable displays . "
C,Task,"And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom comm "
C,Task,"and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ comm "
C,Task,"and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . "
C,Task,"So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"So . "
B,Minor,"Um and uh I could "
C,Task,"Oh yes . "
B,Minor,"Yeah the d "
C,Task,"Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing "
C,Task,"and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . "
C,Task,"So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control . "
B,Task,"We haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . "
B,Task,"That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think the microphone is on on the top comm uh on the middle comm the under the flip . "
B,Minor,"Yes comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"So that will be the safe comm "
A,Minor,"so p any the chip "
A,Task,"it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to "
B,Task,"No comm I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"But it shouldn't be under the flip either comm "
C,Task,"because you can have the remote control closed comm but you still might want to activate it by voice . "
A,Minor,"Uh it's it's "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but uh uh "
A,Task,"my opinion I think it's better under the flip "
A,Task,"because whenever you want to uh the talk comm okay comm so then you can speak then you can close it . "
A,Task,"But if you put it on the on the flip comm okay comm then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible comm "
A,Task,"'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . "
C,Task,"But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice comm why use the voice comm why not just use your hand ? "
C,Task,"I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up comm I can just use my voice . "
B,Task,"Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And you don't wanna let go of either one . "
D,Task,"I don't wanna say . Louder . Yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean it doesn't have to be on the flip comm "
C,Task,"it can be on the side somewhere . "
D,Task,"Can also be on the side . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm the sides maybe is good . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"So comm I mean I can pass this around if anyone wants to "
A,Task,"Yes . So it's maybe good idea . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm y better you pass it around with a napkin . "
D,Task,"No comm because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything comm and it'd be accessible all the time to voice . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm exactly . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So it's maybe good idea . "
A,Minor,"S s "
B,Minor,"It's um It's um "
D,Other,"Compliments to the artist . "
B,Task,"You need to work on the weight a little bit . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Minor,"Okay . S "
A,Minor,"I'm fine comm I'm satisfi "
C,Task,"And maybe the shape of the buttons comm "
C,Task,"the little egg shapes aren't the most economical comm but "
A,Task,"I'm satisfied . "
B,Other,"We're glad you're satisfied . "
A,Task,"Of course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy comm but I think when it's completely maybe it's a less weight . "
C,Task,"Yeah . I mean this is plasticene . "
C,Task,"There's only so much you can do . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well . "
C,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light comm "
C,Task,"because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy comm "
C,Task,"but I think it needs to have some weight comm "
C,Task,"it needs to feel like you're still holding something . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"So that's pretty much it for our presentation actually . "
A,Task,"That's your uh prototype model ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay comm that's good comm thank you very much . "
A,Elicit,"So any comments or uh "
D,Task,"Well comm the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh "
A,Minor,"Yes comm that uh "
A,Minor,"So I'll come back to the "
A,Task,"So evaluation criteria comm I think uh that will be good comm "
A,Task,"so then let's come to the finance uh comm "
A,Other,"I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget . "
A,Task,"So here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells . "
A,Task,"Uh it's optional comm somewhat optional "
A,Task,"and Ed wants the chip on print comm that's what uh we were talking about that . "
A,Task,"So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker comm then uh we have the wood material comm then special colour and push button . "
A,Minor,"So it's uh "
A,Task,"actually comm our budget was uh twelve point five Euro comm "
A,Task,"but uh it's coming to nine point nine five Euro comm "
A,Task,"so we are under uh below the budget comm "
A,Task,"okay comm so still we are saving some money . "
A,Task,"I think it's a good figure . "
B,Task,"Yes comm great "
B,Task,"I I'm surprised . "
B,Other,"Congratulations . "
A,Other,"Than thank you . "
D,Task,"Well we haven't come to mine yet comm so "
B,Task,"Oh comm okay "
D,Task,"we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion comm yes . "
B,Elicit,". It's gonna cost a long way to c you know comm cost a lot of money to market it comm is it ? "
A,Task,"So maybe it's for some money we can utilise for our uh marketing comm for the sales comm okay comm and uh "
D,Minor,"Well comm it just depends on if we're gonna add a o "
D,Task,"on this pr provisionary cost analysis comm we do not have a L_C_ display . "
D,Task,"L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive comm "
C,Task,"No we do comm but it's not filled in . "
D,Minor,"it's gonna be "
C,Task,"It's number thirty . "
D,Minor,"It's not it doesn't say . "
A,Minor,"It's not . "
B,Minor,"Thirty . "
D,Task,"We don't have the price up there comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Oh comm yeah comm yeah comm "
C,Other,"you're right comm sorry comm yes . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"okay comm so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote comm now we're up around about twelve comm twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested . Um "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So that means we can put the uh the L_C_D_ in comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Display in . "
D,Task,"But as far as production um I'm putting up a question "
D,Task,"because we're talking about profit also comm "
D,Task,"and in mine you'll see uh the problem with uh our survey comm the p the possibility that how many units can be sold comm what percentage of the market comm etcetera etcetera "
D,Task,"because that has to be taken in into consideration . "
D,Task,"Uh this is just production cost comm it is not uh advertising cost comm it's not transportation cost uh "
A,Task,"Yes comm so still uh we have twelve point five Euro . "
D,Task,"And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but "
A,Minor,"Yes . Yep . "
C,Minor,"Um-hmm . "
D,Task,"So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit comm we're gonna have to go a long ways . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"This we are talking about one unit comm okay comm "
A,Task,"so when it go into the quantity comm okay comm and the cost will come down . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Slightly . "
B,Task,"Although customisation comm because this is being done comm you know comm the on on-order basis comm it might be uh the the quantity won't m won't uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It's gonna be very hard to reduce . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"the circuit board will b you're right comm would be in producing quantity comm "
B,Task,"but the cost of the case would uh be fixed at the "
B,Task,"Uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro . "
D,Task,"That's not bad . "
B,Minor,"That's really "
B,Task,"that's the cost of the material and lab wow comm that's really outstanding . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But anyhow comm still we are under control comm okay comm "
A,Other,"so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors comm okay comm to get uh the production cost less comm okay comm "
A,Task,"so then we can save some money comm okay comm to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions comm whatever comm okay comm "
A,Other,"so that uh I will look after . "
A,Other,"I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down . "
D,Task,"If we can go to to my display . "
D,Task,"And we'll come back to yours "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Other,"just to give everybody an idea of the market . "
D,Task,"So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project . "
D,Other,"If I'm still here . "
A,Elicit,"You're in four ? "
D,Task,"Yep "
D,Other,"The four gives me "
D,Task,"it's gotta be uh TrendWatch . "
A,Task,"TrendWatch . "
B,Elicit,"Is this the same one you did before ? "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"It shouldn't be "
D,Task,"if it's not it's not the right one . "
C,Task,"That's no comm I think it's the same one . "
D,Task,"No comm no we g no comm that's the same one . "
D,Task,"You have to go back and find another one . "
D,Task,"Whatever name it popped up under . "
D,Task,"Uh functional comm try functional comm "
C,Task,"Functional . "
D,Task,"it might not be it either comm but we'll see . "
C,Task,"It looks like it comm "
C,Minor,"there's "
D,Task,"Yep comm that's it . "
C,Minor,"S Yeah . "
D,Task,"So we'll go screen by screen . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Although "
D,Task,"since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . "
D,Elicit,"Okay ? "
D,Task,"Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million "
D,Task,"which is approximately the same as the independent study . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"So if we continue comm "
D,Task,"we'll look at the findings . "
D,Task,"Next screen . "
D,Task,"Which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"which is actually a tremendous amount . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm no kidding . "
D,Task,"No kidding comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Mayb maybe they already expected something . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Task,"if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro comm "
D,Task,"okay comm we're already in that that price comm okay comm "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"with transport comm promotion comm labour comm because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost comm transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers . "
C,Minor,"Um-hmm . "
D,Task,"Twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . "
D,Task,"At two million units comm we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Elicit,"Okay ? "
D,Minor,"So comm obviously we w w "
D,Task,"I just did a run down the evaluation of the form comm "
D,Task,"the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the of the unit comm the ease of use comm speech recognition comm cost comm we've gone through these . "
D,Task,"Now comm the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . "
D,Task,"Or we project this over two years comm "
D,Task,"but being that the market changes very very quickly comm maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"So comm now we have to come up with a decision . "
A,Task,"Of course . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"Can the company sell two million units ? "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Elicit,"Can it sell it for fifty Euros ? "
B,Task,"Could could I go to findings ? "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Other,"Uh uh um I would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel "
B,Task,"which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"I was thinking the same thing comm yeah . "
B,Task,"and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence . "
C,Task,"Directly . "
B,Task,"That way you have no storage comm you have no um "
B,Task,"you do have transportation comm still have the labour cost comm "
C,Minor,"Um-hmm . "
B,Task,"but you don't have the transport to the uh point of sale . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"The point of sale is online . "
A,Other,"To the agents . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You can do a shipping centre somewhere comm "
C,Task,"or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs . "
B,Task,"Right comm like Amazon . "
B,Task,"In fact comm we should sell through Amazon comm "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Elicit,"don't you think ? "
A,Task,"Or eBay comm or "
B,Task,"Or eBay comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"There's an idea . "
B,Minor,"Going with um "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's a good idea . "
A,Task,"To impro more profit and uh "
D,Task,"S Upscale technology . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm yes . "
B,Task,"Ah comm we we're do you know comm selling a unique product uh . "
D,Task,"Well . "
C,Task,"That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable comm "
C,Task,"'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have comm see maybe what other people have done comm what the range of possibility as comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"There are several companies that have gone that way . "
C,Task,"whereas if you're in a store comm you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person comm you may not really know what it is you want comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"whereas on the web comm if you have a bunch of pictures comm it can sort of trigger ideas and "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"the only thing that you're missing really is the weight . "
C,Task,"The weight and feel . "
D,Task,"Weight comm the feel of the product comm but "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We're getting used to that . "
B,Task,"It's not quite like trying on a shoe comm "
B,Task,"but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"There are several that have gone through with the watches comm too . "
D,Task,"You can customise a watch comm "
D,Task,"you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"you can change it uh "
D,Task,"There's a lot of online that's that is doing this now . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"And when you're rotating comm you'll look behind and look this way uh "
D,Task,"it's possible to do with this comm "
D,Task,"maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year comm which could you know comm feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"We can . "
B,Task,"Great . "
A,Task,"I don't think that's uh not possible comm "
A,Minor,"it's uh "
A,Task,"okay then comm l uh let's wait for the production comm okay comm then uh you can evaluate the product comm "
A,Task,"so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real . "
C,Elicit,"What turnaround time do we have ? "
A,Minor,"T "
C,Task,"'Cause I mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long . "
A,Minor,"Oh but "
A,Task,"Yes it's it's very quick comm of course . "
A,Task,"It will uh come back in two weeks comm okay comm "
A,Task,"it will be ready in two weeks . "
B,Task,"Works for me . "
A,Task,"For evaluation comm okay . "
B,Elicit,"Prototypes comm you mean . "
A,Task,"Yes comm the prototype uh prototype product evaluation . "
B,Minor,"In um "
B,Task,"We probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Well comm obviously . "
A,Minor,"Yes . Yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"to see get get their "
A,Task,"So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"it's not a trivial task . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm because we we are not going to do it in uh our factory comm okay comm so we can give it a product evalua "
C,Task,"No no . "
C,Task,"We definitely shouldn't do it in our factory . "
A,Task,"Yes comm yes . "
A,Task,"So we'll do it in the other place comm "
A,Task,"and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time . "
A,Minor,"Or uh "
A,Task,"Okay comm so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation comm okay comm "
A,Task,"then uh it's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team comm okay comm uh from the management comm then we can launch in the market . "
A,Minor,"Hm ? "
B,Elicit,"Any outstanding ? "
A,Elicit,"S Any any other uh questions or uh comments to be discuss ? "
B,Minor,"No comm I'm "
C,Minor,"What ab "
D,Task,"I think we pretty much covered everything . "
B,Other,"go ahead . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so then uh "
B,Elicit,"Did you have something ? "
C,Elicit,"Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad comm this is bad comm we want this done differently . "
A,Task,"Okay uh comm let's take like this . "
A,Task,"Let's proceed with this model comm okay comm for the for the marketing direction comm okay . "
A,Task,"So no more changes will be made comm okay comm in this the basic design . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Task,"So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market "
A,Task,"and let's take the feedback from the customers comm then we can uh go for the "
B,Task,"Second generation . "
A,Task,"second generation . "
A,Task,"Okay . There's no end comm there's not limit . "
C,Task,"The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . "
A,Minor,"Every every custom "
D,Task,"Well comm then it may not be . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Well comm every customer comm okay comm they have their own ideas comm they have their own test comm okay comm so there's no end comm there's no limit . "
D,Task,"Like people don't like wood . "
C,Task,"No comm but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . "
D,Task,"very specific . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm so that's the reason you are here for uh the design comm okay comm "
A,Elicit,"I hope you made a good design . "
C,Task,"Yes comm but I'm not everybody . "
C,Task,"I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . "
C,Task,"We have our own motivations in mind comm we have our own ideas in mind comm "
C,Task,"but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but uh see comm we ought to take a few considerations comm okay comm "
A,Task,"one is the price consideration comm one is future consideration comm okay comm like uh you can eat uh you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli comm okay comm "
A,Task,"so i it's a depends on the individual taste comm you know comm "
A,Task,"so we have we have to balance somewhere . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
C,Task,"I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short "
C,Task,"well you have no redesign not you personally comm but in the project we have no redesign time and "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Our project doesn't um "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Ed comm d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales ? "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Would it be the Christmas season by any chance ? "
A,Task,"The sports time . "
B,Task,"Sports season . "
D,Task,"Right before the Eur the World Cup . World soccer . World Cup soccer comm "
B,Elicit,"Which sport season ? "
A,Task,"Football . "
B,Minor,"So so "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control . "
A,Task,"Football . "
B,Minor,"maybe what "
B,Task,"So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's a good idea . "
B,Minor,"And and then um "
B,Task,"so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated comm "
B,Task,"because I don't know when the World Cup is comm "
B,Task,"but I'm sure there's gonna be one . "
D,Task,"Or any major sports . "
B,Task,"Or another m major sports event . "
B,Task,"Probably not the um the football games coming up the end of January . "
B,Task,"I think that might be a little too aggressive um comm "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but comm so comm I'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing "
A,Task,"Research . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event "
B,Minor,"or uh perhaps to uh also "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"That's actually good place to advertise it too . "
B,Task,"And to work with motion pictures . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on D_V_D_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it comm "

B,Task,"but people had gotten the throw-away comm you know comm paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't um "
