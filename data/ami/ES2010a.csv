A,Task,"Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . "
A,Task,"We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . "
A,Task,"Um tool training comm we're going to comm I guess comm figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . "
A,Task,"Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . "
A,Task,"Okay comm here is our project . "
A,Task,"We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original comm trendy and also user-friendly . "
A,Minor,"And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um "
A,Task,"We're gonna have discuss the functional design first comm how is it gonna be used comm what's the actual goal here comm it has to operate T_V_ comm blah blah blah . "
A,Task,"And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . "
A,Task,"Same thing with conceptual design . "
A,Task,"Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work comm meet . "
A,Task,"That's pretty much the the whole process for today . "
A,Task,"And then the detailed design comm just more in-depth comm get the actual schematics of the remote . "
A,Task,"Okay . Alright . "
A,Task,"First we're gonna start off by using our tools . "
A,Elicit,"And the whiteboard thing comm do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here . "
B,Task,"I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing . "
D,Minor,"We could "
D,Task,"Yeah comm we could on here . "
A,Task,"Alright comm let's go forward then . "
A,Task,"Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . "

D,Task,"No comm that's good . "
A,Task,"No comm no comm no comm "
A,Task,"it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur comm "
A,Other,"but whatever . "
A,Task,"I don't know even much about giraffes comm but I just love the way they look . "
A,Task,"They're just such odd creatures comm you know . "
A,Task,"I I like that they're so unique and individual comm I guess . "
A,Task,"I don't know much about their behaviour or anything comm though . "
A,Task,"Only seen a couple in zoos . "
D,Task,"You don't really have to comm I mean comm if you like 'em "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but you can appreciate the way they look . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Alright . "
A,Task,"Guess we're getting straight back into business here . "
A,Task,"Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro comm "
A,Task,"and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . "
A,Task,"We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States comm in Europe comm in Asia . "
A,Task,"And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So we're gonna talk for a little while . "
A,Task,"Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . "
A,Task,"Expe our experiences with remote controls um comm our first ideas about this new remote comm "
A,Task,"anything that you can bring to the table for this project . "
A,Minor,"So . "
C,Elicit,"Now ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"You wanna start us off ? "
A,Elicit,"Anybody have anything to offer ? "
B,Task,"Well comm we wanna make a multifunctional remote comm "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"One remote for everything . "
C,Task,"And everything being Wait comm we have what comm sound system comm T_V_ comm D_V_D_ comm V_H_S_ comm uh TiVo ? "
D,Task,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm TiVo . "
A,Other,"TiVo . "
C,Task,"But it's still there comm so "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"if po if we're gonna do it "
D,Task,"It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal . "
A,Task,"They're never universal . That's right . "
A,Task,"Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product comm D_V_D_ player comm say comm usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the "
C,Task,"Or if it's not like a Sony comm if it's like a I don't know . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Something from Sam's club . "
B,Task,"So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet comm "
D,Task,"because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Kay comm "
A,Task,"and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product comm how it feels in your hand . "
A,Task,"If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more . "
A,Task,"They want the ergonomic ones . "
D,Task,"They want like the flashy lights . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Oh like this came from Las Vegas . "
A,Task,"Ones that ones that look high-tech comm too . "
C,Task,"But at the same time are simple . "
D,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
A,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"So that people like my mother can use it . "
B,Task,"What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that "
C,Task,"Just bad ones . "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's true . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
B,Elicit,"What kinda battery would we want to use ? "
B,Minor,"Because battery changing is usually "
C,Minor,"D "
C,Task,"Double A_ . "
D,Task,"Double A_ . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Do some of them use triple A_s though ? "
D,Task,"Yeah some use triple A_s . "
C,Minor,"Some but "
D,Task,"So double or triple ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I guess then it's "
C,Task,"If we need to do triple A_ we can comm but most people usually have double A_s around . "
A,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
A,Task,"But that has to do with the size of it too . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well comm w as long as we know that issue is "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"if we want it to be more thin comm then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ . "
A,Minor,"Here we can "
A,Task,"Triple A . "
B,Elicit,"Can you with a small lithium battery ? "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"it's okay comm we don't have to decide about it now comm "
A,Task,"just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . "
A,Minor,"Hey . "
A,Elicit,"Anything else ? "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Moving along . "
A,Other,"Oh comm "
A,Task,"we're closing the meeting . "
A,Task,"Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes . "
A,Task,"Here's what we're going to do . "
A,Task,"Um the I_D_ comm "
A,Elicit,"which is who ? "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"you're going to think about the working design . "
A,Elicit,"What do you think that means ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And U_I_D_ comm the technical fun functions design comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do comm the functionality of it comm operating all those different things . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And the marketing person comm that's Courtney comm is going to do the user requirements specification . "
A,Task,"I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . "
A,Elicit,"Right ? "
D,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"I would think so . Okay . "
A,Task,"And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ? "
A,Task,"Okay . This meeting is officially over . "
