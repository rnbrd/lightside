B,Task,". Leave it here . "
B,Task,"That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . "
C,Task,"Like this one . "
B,Minor,"But uh we don't uh we don't uh "
B,Task,"we do think it's um well what if with ease of use comm w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers . "
C,Task,"It's important . "
C,Task,"Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . "
C,Task,"Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . "
C,Task,"And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions comm "
C,Task,"and then they will not use this dial as often . "
C,Task,"But other users who are new to this device need something like that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"They n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume comm "
C,Task,"so it's easier for them "
A,Elicit,"Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm maybe so . Yes comm "
A,Elicit,"A a and the voice recognition as well comm "
C,Minor,"it's "
A,Minor,"th maybe you could uh could uh "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"it's it's it's another approach comm "
C,Minor,"it's more that our um . "
C,Task,"There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's it's quite easy . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Okay comm "
A,Other,"good . "
A,Elicit,"And and the case is is rubber ? "
C,Task,"Yes comm rubber ? "
A,Elicit,"And the buttons ? "
B,Task,"Plastic or rubber . "
C,Task,"There are plastic or rubber . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Other,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"and uh the colouring ? "
C,Task,"Uh yellow with uh "
A,Elicit,"with with grey or black . "
C,Task,"grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we'll we'll come to that later . Um "
A,Minor,"okay . "
A,Elicit,"Anything else to add "
A,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button comm "
C,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"'cause you have to assign two channel new channels . "
C,Minor,"Yes comm "
C,Minor,"but it "
C,Task,"but these are tasks that are only executed once comm I think . "
A,Minor,"M uh "
C,Elicit,"Or not ? "
A,Elicit,"yeah . "
A,Task,"M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition comm or train the voice voice recognition . "
D,Minor,"You "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"okay . Okay comm yeah comm that's right . Or something li like that . "
B,Task,"And a button for disabling the voice recognition . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two comm three seconds comm you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"but o okay comm "
A,Task,"that that's not really really important . "
B,Task,"That's the basic idea comm yeah . Of our prototype . "
A,Minor,"The basic "
A,Task,"okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um "
A,Elicit,"you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Uh my name is not name "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Other,"You are nameless . "
D,Minor,"Uh well comm "
D,Task,"I used the the uh documents . "
D,Task,"And these uh were the most important criteria . "
D,Minor,"It should be . "
D,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Other,"Is it spongy ? "
D,Task,"that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . "
D,Elicit,"Fancy look and feel . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"just walk through it step by step . "
B,Elicit,"I mean comm is it fancy comm "
B,Minor,"everything I believe uh "
D,Minor,"Uh well "
B,Task,"I believe it's fancy . "
D,Minor,"appar "
C,Task,"I believe it's fancy too . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Other,"sorry . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Minor,"this "
A,Elicit,"these are the cr uh the criteria . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I think these are the most important criteria . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
D,Minor,"So uh "
D,Task,"that's about it . "
A,Other,"the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um "
A,Task,"The production costs . "
A,Minor,"The costs are not under Can I Um this is the "
B,Task,"Twenty two . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty . "
B,Task,"Yikes . "
A,Task,"And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"it's very expensive . "
A,Task,"So I guess we should skip that comm "
A,Task,"because it's not that important . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Why does the price and and the s "
B,Other,"oh comm "
B,Minor,"one uh exa "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"the the price comm the the number of items and the the sum . "
B,Other,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"The number of uh "
B,Other,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um well comm "
A,Task,"this is what I would call our luxury model . "
A,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"And and does it "
A,Minor,"if you would "
A,Task,"if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty comm "
A,Task,"um then I did the following changes . "
A,Task,"Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"um by not using the voice recognition feature comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price . "
A,Minor,"Um Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I believe "
A,Minor,"Uh comm push-button comm "
A,Minor,"well "
A,Minor,"It makes it the thirteen "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Push-buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive comm "
A,Task,"but do add extra cost . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"So um yeah comm "
A,Task,"th this design is not um within our price model . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"But I'm afraid it's not complete . "
C,Task,"Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials comm the last item . "
C,Task,"And you have not added one item there . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So it's c way too expensive . "
A,Task,"It's still too expensive comm yeah . Um "
B,Task,"But that's that's only for the buttons . "
B,Task,"So the button we can use plastic . "
A,Task,"I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out comm um "
A,Other,"oh . "
A,Task,"And uh maybe not use the special form . "
B,Minor,"And the pla uh "
B,Elicit,"And a plastic b just plastic buttons comm a plas uh instead of rubber . "
C,Minor,"But it "
A,Task,"It becomes a very dull remote control comm I know . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"But it's the board decision . "
A,Minor,"Um And um "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well comm b basically "
C,Minor,"it "
C,Task,"when when this is our only option comm we should even consider changing the casing comm "
C,Task,"because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I know . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh "
C,Task,"Type of m maybe another market segment . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"m "
A,Task,"uh maybe not not all that fancy comm but just way way more easy uh uh um basic "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"and uh m maximise the profits "
A,Minor,"and um "
C,Task,"That's maybe that's better . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but that's not what uh has been asked . "
A,Task,"I know comm I know . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"we should kick the board's "
C,Minor,"uh Well "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Although I think we yeah comm but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people "
A,Task,"uh by giving it another colour already . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Task,"it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not comm no . "
A,Task,"It's not that innovative . "
A,Elicit,"Or however you s pronounce that . "
A,Minor,"Um so comm okay . Um Oh comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm too bad . "
A,Task,"this is the wrong one . "
A,Minor,"So uh "
A,Task,"that means redesign . "
A,Task,"We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . "
A,Elicit,"Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . "
A,Minor,"I guess "
D,Minor,"Um well comm "
D,Task,"since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"maybe it's good to do it anyway comm "
C,Task,"because if we evaluate it comm we we can also determine if our objectives are good . "
A,Task,"We l we can learn . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . I agree . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Well "
C,Elicit,"Is it fancy ? "
A,Minor,"I d "
A,Task,"it is it is "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Yay . "
D,Elicit,"Is it ? Is it fancy ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
B,Task,"Um the yellow rubber comm I think so . "
C,Task,"I think so . "
A,Other,"You like the rubber comm uh Roo . "
B,Other,"I'm into it . "
D,Minor,"So uh "
D,Elicit,"one ? "
C,Task,"But it's not that fancy . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"I mean "
A,Task,"I'll I'll I'll give it a two . "
C,Task,"I think uh I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing . "
C,Minor,"It would be even more "
A,Other,"You like tita "
C,Other,"oh comm you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . "
A,Other,"That's a flavour as well . "
C,Other,"It has flavour . Yes comm that's right . You should taste it . "
A,Minor,"Right . Um "
D,Minor,"Is it uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm I know comm "
A,Minor,"but but it "
A,Minor,"but that's fancy in the way um I mean fancy has has a lot of "
C,Task,"It has to do with fashion comm I guess . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"do "
B,Task,"It's trendy trendy comm fun "
D,Minor,"And w "
D,Minor,"yeah comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials . "
D,Task,"So in that way It it's fancy . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It applies . "
A,Minor,"It "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Elicit,"just give it a two . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"I think I th I think it would have been I would have think uh "
B,Task,"It's not the ultimate uh fancy two comm but "
C,Task,"it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy comm "
C,Task,"but we decided not to comm "
C,Task,"because if we use a double-curved case comm we could not use solar . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but that's sti that's uh "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Looking at the user uh needs comm we only uh don't we don't have the double-curved case . "
B,Task,"We w we do have uh the rubber comm "
B,Task,"we do have the colours . "
B,Task,"That's two out of three . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"So I believe uh we are close uh to two . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I I agree . "
C,Task,"Yes comm I agree too . It's okay . "
C,Minor,"We did "
C,Minor,"yes comm "
C,Task,"we did good . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm and uh "
D,Elicit,"was it innovative ? "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"with the voice recognition feature "
A,Minor,"and uh "
B,Task,"But that's not in it . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Ov or can we "
A,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype . "
C,Minor,"let's let's this product . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And the scroll uh wheel . The solar "
B,Task,"not many remotes have the solar comm I think . "
C,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm and uh "
C,Minor,"but it's it's way too "
A,Task,"That would have been a thrill . "
C,Task,"yes comm "
C,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"So uh "
D,Elicit,"also a uh two ? "
C,Task,"I think uh it's a two . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Elicit,"Is it easy to use ? "
A,Task,"I'm not sure . I'm not sure . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well yeah comm "
B,Task,"the voice recognition of course is hard to learn comm I think . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Minor,"hard "
B,Task,"it's not for the for the e for the elderly . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"They won't use it . "
C,Task,"but there are two parts in this remote control . "
C,Task,"What you see here is is the basic part . "
C,Task,"Everybody can use it comm "
C,Task,"so that's easy to use . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's for a novice user . "
C,Task,"When you have a more advanced comm elaborate user comm well comm such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . "
C,Task,"So in that in that way it is advanced comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . "
C,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"I think I think a three . "
C,Minor,"It's maybe it's not very uh easy for "
B,Other,"Wouldn't give it more . "
A,Task,"Uh I'm doubting doubting as well . Um "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"the p "
D,Task,"the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping comm channel switching comm volume . "
D,Task,"But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Uh "
A,Elicit,"two "
A,Elicit,"or three ? Three ? "
A,Elicit,"Wha wh what would be your guess ? "
A,Task,"I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"It's the uh it's it's overall . "
A,Elicit,"Is the device easy to use ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . You're right in that comm "
C,Task,"but I I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"because he is already he or she is already an advanced user . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"After all comm I think personally I would give a two . "
A,Other,"Um Okay . "
C,Minor,"But "
A,Elicit,"Uh Roo comm a three ? "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Elicit,"Ruud ? "
D,Task,"Good question . "
D,Task,"Uh I'll go uh for the two . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So comm it's two comm two and three . Two threes . "
C,Task,"So that's ten . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"I could make it e easy ? "
B,Task,"If you make it a four it will be three in general . "
C,Minor,"So that's w "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"two and a half . "
B,Task,"If he makes it a four . Not a three . "
C,Task,"Six and four . Six and four is ten . "
C,Task,"Divided by four is two and a half . "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Other,"Darn . "
B,Task,"Nee . "
D,Other,"Hmm ? Huh ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Other,"Roo . "
B,Minor,"A seven comm a three "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"Yeah . I yeah . "
B,Task,"A four and a three together . "
C,Other,"Four ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"you have a two comm he has a two . Three ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"two comm two comm three "
C,Task,"Two ? "
B,Elicit,"And a three ? "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"I haven't said anything yet . "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Nee . I know . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"but if I would say a three comm then it's six comm and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . "
C,Task,"Divided by four . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three . Then you would make a four . "
B,Minor,"If you fill out a four "
C,Minor,"That's not even "
A,Task,"But I'm filling in a three . "
A,Minor,"Does it will "
A,Task,"so it will be a two point five . "
C,Task,"But that's not possible to fill in comm "
A,Task,"Yes comm it is . "
C,Task,"so we have to round it . "
A,Other,"I have a veto . "
A,Task,"Exactly . "
A,Task,"It's not about the content comm "
A,Minor,"it's about "
A,Minor,"okay comm um "
D,Elicit,"Is it easy to find ? "
A,Minor,"is it easy to f "
A,Task,"Yeah comm definitely . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out comm "
B,Task,"but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . "
C,Task,"It it most definitely is it's very easy . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"or beeps "
A,Minor,"or "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Maybe "
C,Minor,"Uh I I think I think "
A,Task,"I'm here comm I'm here . "
C,Task,"something like that . "
C,Task,"Maybe you have to uh programme it once comm so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence comm something like where are you comm and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But even without it "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
A,Minor,"Well comm I uh "
C,Minor,"I th "
A,Task,"we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time comm "
A,Task,"but I personally give it a one . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Um Sebastian ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm me too . "
B,Task,"Me too . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
A,Minor,"Right comm well . "
A,Elicit,"The feel of the remote control is spongy . "
A,Minor,"Well comm uh "
A,Task,"it can't be more spongy . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"it can be . "
C,Task,"There are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . "
B,Elicit,"Was it one of our options ? "
C,Task,"No comm it's not one of our option comm "
D,Minor,"No . Uh "
A,Minor,"No okay comm "
D,Task,"this this was a most spongy option . "
C,Minor,"but when you look in the market comm when you look "
B,Minor,"So comm in the in "
A,Minor,"but but "
A,Task,"for the options given comm it's the most spongy one . "
C,Task,"Uh yes comm "
C,Task,"but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about comm I think . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . "
A,Other,"They're out there . "
B,Task,"But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . "
C,Task,"Yes comm but it's not good enough comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so it's a two . "
A,Task,"I'll give it a one . "
B,Minor,"I wan "
B,Task,"I'll take one . "
C,Other,"You take one ? "
C,Elicit,"What do you give it ? "
D,Minor,"Well yeah comm "
D,Task,"it depends comm "
D,Task,"'cause it's the most spongy we could "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I know comm "
A,Task,"but you have to name a fig uh a number . "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Because we need to go on in for the time . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . "
B,Task,"It will be a one . "
D,Task,"So I'll just give it a two "
D,Task,"and make this a one point five . "
C,Task,"No no no . "
C,Other,"Uh I'll I'll change it comm "
C,Minor,"I'll make it m "
C,Other,"my my mark will be a four . "
A,Minor,"You are "
A,Minor,"okay . "
A,Elicit,"The remote control offers enough features . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Elicit,"Ruud comm what what do you think about it ? "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"the basic layout doesn't offem offer much comm "
D,Task,"but the voice recognition could add a lot . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Basically it's it's completely programmable . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"depends . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I know . "
C,Task,"So it's quite advanced . "
A,Minor,"What what we didn't talk about is um uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but it ha doesn't has the digits . "
B,Minor,"I believe it's "
B,Task,"If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features comm I don't I don't think it is it has all the features um a normal remote has . "
A,Task,"I think it has . "
D,Task,"Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Bec because you can um "
A,Task,"we didn't talk about it comm "
A,Task,"but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one comm hit the one or the two or the three comm whatever comm and it r records the uh the um the the signals . "
C,Task,"Has uh the signals sent to it . "
D,Task,"Signal . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like comm as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . "
A,Task,"So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . "
C,Task,"Absolutely . "
A,Task,"Although there are i a few buttons comm "
A,Task,"but the inside is is quite uh advanced . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"But that that's its power comm I guess comm "
C,Task,"because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains comm well comm uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . "
C,Task,"And this is quite s simple . "
C,Task,"You can use your voice to to programme it . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"It's "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm um "
A,Elicit,"let's give it a number . "
A,Task,"I'll give it uh a one . For for the for this t uh type of market comm I think it's a one . "
B,Task,"I'll give a two . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I'll give it a one . "
D,Task,"Um I think think a one comm "
D,Task,"'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want comm "
D,Minor,"so that's like um "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"I I've I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good comm but not for this kind of market comm and not for this kind of price . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So high quality comm low acceptance . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"But whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well comm is not sure . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"D do you agree ? "
C,Task,"Yes comm I agree . I "
D,Task,"Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Other,"Maybe we should have a radar uh function . "
C,Minor,"But "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"But we could couldn't uh what "
B,Elicit,"what's the selling price ? "
B,Elicit,"Fifty ? "
A,Task,"Twenty five Euros . "
B,Other,"Uh twenty five . "
B,Task,"And costs were twelve fifty . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But even now comm if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double comm "
B,Elicit,"Think . Production cost was were t uh was twenty two ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"selling price uh would be uh "
C,Task,"M about fifty Euros . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"That's quite ex "
B,Minor,"That's price comm but w w "
C,Minor,"well comm "
C,Task,"it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality . "
B,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"An original remote control of any T_V_ kind comm uh a Phillips remote control comm y you pay uh "
C,Minor,"Yes comm "
C,Task,"it's more than fifty Euros . "
C,Task,"It's quite expensive comm yes . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I kn I know uh from a few years ago comm it it it costed hundred Gilders . "
A,Minor,"Bu but well "
A,Task,"yeah comm I know comm "
A,Task,"but you're paying for th for the brand comm "
A,Task,"because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo comm television comm D_V_D_ comm C_D_ player comm for under twenty five Euros . "
C,Task,"Yes . Yes comm "
C,Minor,"but you can you c "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Task,"but you can learn this thing comm all these functions . "
C,Task,"And it's easier to use "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition "
C,Task,"and this one does . "
A,Minor,". "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So I think it's worth its price . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Um you had an overall rating . Um "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"but uh with these ratings uh "
A,Task,"That's counting . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"it's it's about one point five . Something like that . "
D,Task,"should be about one point s seven comm "
B,Other,"Four six seven eight . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Nine divided by six . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um "
A,Task,"we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself comm not about the product . "
A,Elicit,"Um What did you think about uh the process comm the project process ? "
A,Elicit,"Ruud ? "
A,Task,"Try to translate that . "
C,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Any any other "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm Roo ? "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"I think uh "
C,Minor,"I think "
D,Minor,"Ye "
A,Task,"Roo . "
B,Task,"The process was good . "
B,Task,"But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And and that was the the big deal . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I if we knew that before comm we c we could have made "
C,Minor,"Actually comm "
C,Minor,"we had "
B,Minor,"the the choice between what "
A,Task,"Better decision . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"We had we had too little information actually . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So And uh um "
C,Minor,"the the the "
C,Minor,"well comm "
C,Task,"looking at room for creativity comm there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow . "
A,Task,"Less . "
C,Minor,"So there was not really a process of uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So we could we we could be we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"The prices . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"in the first meeting we we already were very creative . "
C,Task,"We we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We're tempered by that comm yes . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ? "
B,Task,"No comm no . "
A,Elicit,"Ruud ? "
D,Task,"I agree . "
A,Other,"You agree comm okay . "
A,Elicit,"Uh leadership . "
B,Other,"Fantastic . "
A,Other,"Okay comm Roo's on for his promotion . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I think we're a good team . "
A,Task,"I think so too comm "
A,Task,"it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . "
A,Task,"I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh comm hey Roo uh . Um "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"I tried once comm "
C,Task,"but that was not allowed . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . So um "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"but but si uh w w w "
A,Task,"when taken in account the the situation comm uh I think we performed pretty well . "
C,Task,"I think so too . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Um "
A,Elicit,"the means comm the SMARTboard comm the digital pen . Did you like 'em ? "
C,Task,"Uh . The digital pen was okay comm "
C,Task,"but SMARTboard was really bad . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"It it's "
A,Elicit,"Because of the response "
A,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"The response is very slow "
B,Task,"Response "
B,Minor,"and "
C,Task,"and the possibilities are very limited . "
C,Task,"It's not accurate . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Uh it it has "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"yeah . Yeah comm it's not accurate . "
B,Task,"The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes "
B,Minor,"its um uh where it uh "
D,Task,"Draws . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm where it draws . "
B,Minor,"It's uh "
B,Task,"the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"it it had to be um better aligned comm or what's the word ? "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Minor,"You to take in account that your you m "
A,Task,"Uh yeah . "
B,Task,"yeah uh "
C,Task,"Maybe it's it needs to be calibrateds . "
B,Task,"It's too slow "
A,Task,"It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before comm the third meeting . "
C,Elicit,"It is ? "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So uh it's not the calibration comm "
A,Task,"it's the thing itself comm I think . "
B,Other,"Hmm . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Uh Ruud comm w uh did you use the pen a lot ? "
A,Elicit,"Or not at all ? "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"Not at all . "
D,Task,"Not really . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I thought it was quite a handy uh thing comm "
C,Task,"I I think so too . "
A,Task,"although I would like to see um O_C_R_ . "
C,Task,"Yes . Yes . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"If it has O_C_R_ comm uh I think uh I would use comm "
B,Task,"but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"It w it w "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"It was necessary for me to uh "
A,Task,"To digitise them . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"because if I want something on the computer comm I just type it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I type faster than I write . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem comm uh writing down some notes comm some some inf uh information comm and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Because you have everything in one place "
C,Minor,"and it's quite easy quite easy "
C,Task,"it's it's possible to make this information digital "
C,Task,"and share it with others in a quite easy way . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think it's a good product . "
C,Task,"I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's not quite uh ergonomic . Eco ergonomic . "
B,Task,"Economic . "
A,Other,"I know . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Okay . Um "
A,Minor,"What w "
A,Elicit,"Uh Ruud comm what did you think about the SMARTboards ? "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"I only use it to draw a rabbit comm "
A,Other,"Yeah . Okay comm you can't really decide . No . "
D,Task,"so can't say much about it . "
A,Task,"I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . "
A,Task,"I think that would be very easy if you could say okay comm I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on "
A,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"No comm "
D,Task,"or the other way around . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Or the other way around comm "
A,Minor,"that you could show but m "
C,Minor,"Yes comm yes . "
C,Task,"That's quite what PowerPoint does . "
B,Minor,"But y you can "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"if you save this image comm you can open it in your shared work folder . "
A,Task,"I know . "
A,Task,"I know comm "
A,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"So it's almost "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"I know comm "
A,Task,"but we couldn't use that feature comm "
A,Task,"so I missed it . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"We weren't able to do that . "
A,Task,"At least the um I wasn't explained how to do such a th "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . . "
B,Task,"A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object . "
C,Task,"An object comm yes . Yes . "
C,Task,"The drawing cap capabilities are very limited . "
B,Minor,"I it's not possible "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And and uh w you were when you're using uh Windows comm you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons comm uh which you can use for drawing . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . "
C,Minor,"So it's "
B,Task,"Oh it looks like paint actually . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Minor,"y it "
A,Task,"it's not even as advanced as paint . "
C,Task,"Not not uh n not way . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's quite uh limited . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Uh no . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm the project is evaluated . "
A,Minor,"Um but comm well comm "
A,Task,"we need to redesign uh the product . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Oh comm "
C,Other,"very good comm "
C,Task,"celebration . "
A,Other,"Celebrate "
C,Task,"Pop uh pop up the champagne . "
B,Other,"Great . "
B,Other,"It was a privilege working with you . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um "
A,Task,"you're dismissed . "
A,Task,"No comm I think we are uh ready . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"To private rooms ? "
C,Task,"I see some action over there . "
A,Task,"Private room comm Roo . "
A,Task,"That sounds quite scary . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"No comm let's find uh the way to . . "
C,Task,"uh we're done comm we're finished comm I believe . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Elicit,"are there any more cycles in this process ? "
C,Task,"I think not . "
A,Task,"I don't believe so . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"maybe we'd get an email . Thank you for your "
C,Elicit,"But um how much time did we get for this meeting ? "
A,Task,"Forty minutes . "
C,Elicit,"And how much time is left ? "
A,Task,"A minute or or ten maybe . "
A,Minor,"M "
C,Other,"Ten minutes . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"ten or five . "
C,Other,"Okay . Okay . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Minor,"we can uh redesign our uh Uh I would like to "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . "
C,Task,"A simple comm dull comm uh one-coloured box . "
D,Task,"And no added value . At all . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"it's it's just the same product that is already on the market . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
B,Elicit,"But you see the problem comm "
B,Task,"y you can't continue your uh your line . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"it's fluffy alright . "
B,Task,"Spongy . "
C,Elicit,"What is that ? "
B,Task,"A giraffe ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree . "
A,Task,"It's blue tongue . "
D,Other,"In interesting design . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"This is a new model . "
A,Minor,"But "
C,Other,"So you're actually promoting Bluetooth . Or blue tongue . "
A,Other,"Blue tongue . "
D,Other,"Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"It's spongy . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,". That is uh it's a new feature next to Bluetooth to um disable all Bluetooth devices . Um "
C,Other,"Blue tongue . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Right . "
