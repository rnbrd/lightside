A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Minor,"our new project is about "
A,Task,"we need design a remote control for television set comm "
A,Minor,"so comm "
A,Task,"which has to be original comm trendy and user-friendly . "
A,Task,"I took this off our corporate website . "
A,Minor,"It's "
A,Task,"I think well it sums up what we need to do . "
A,Task,"We're inspired by latest fashion comm not only electronics comm but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . "
A,Task,"That's why our product will always fit in your home . "
A,Task,"So apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . "
A,Task,"So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So So "
A,Task,"we put the fashion in electronics . "
A,Task,"So that's what we need to go for . "
A,Task,"Anyway comm we'll take this project in three steps comm three pha uh three phase of design . "
A,Task,"First step will be the functional design . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And that's basically what we're gonna do . "
A,Task,"Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards comm "
A,Task,"so we can share information "
A,Minor,"about "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"I'm gonna keep this short comm "
A,Task,"since we had a technical problem . "
A,Other,"So skip through this . "
A,Minor,"Uh . Okay . "
A,Task,"Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything comm "
A,Task,"so to help with these comm you have we have the SMARTboards here . "
A,Task,"We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . "
A,Other,"I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board comm "
A,Minor,"so it's "
A,Task,"actually it's very easy . "
A,Task,"Like it says comm very simple comm "
A,Task,"you just take out the pen . "
A,Other,"Like you see here comm I'll just take the take here . "
A,Task,"That's it comm you just put it on the board . "
A,Task,"You see a pen here . "
A,Task,"You go here comm "
A,Task,"just like using a pen . "
A,Task,"You can just draw whatever you want . "
A,Task,"It's like the eraser comm "
A,Task,"can erase whatever you want . "
A,Task,"And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views comm "
A,Task,"if you wanna change the format comm you just either take out jus just like the pen comm and whatever you want comm your current colour comm your line width comm just to make the line bigger . "
A,Task,"So it should be really easy . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"This is to take the "
A,Task,"just take a new slide "
A,Task,"and back again . "
A,Task,"We're just gonna keep using this board all the time comm "
A,Minor,"so I think it will be "
A,Elicit,"it's very clear for everyone comm I suppose . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"I'll take this out . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We'll use that later . Anyway . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm just just "
A,Task,"just stuff that you wanna share comm just put it in the in the project folder comm "
A,Task,"like I put my presentation now . "
A,Other,"I'll put the the minutes of every meeting comm I'll put them there too comm "
A,Task,"so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"next comm been here . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Other,"gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"basic idea is we have a blank sheet . "
A,Task,"Just try whatever you want comm "
A,Task,"and like it says comm draw your favourite animal . "
A,Task,"I think the creative genius should go first . "
B,Other,"The creative genius ? "
B,Other,"Thank you very much . "
A,Task,"So comm draw us your favourite animal . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing comm "
B,Other,"so I'm not really good at drawing animals comm "
A,Other,"Draw us a technical animal . "
B,Minor,"but uh the animal which I Oh . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's still erasing . "
B,Other,"Pen . "
B,Other,"Uh format . "
B,Task,"Else my animal will be like king-size . "
B,Task,"I pretty much like a dolphin comm "
B,Task,"because of its uh its freedom basically . "
B,Minor,"Let's see . "
B,Other,"A head . "
B,Task,"actually worked with this . "
B,Task,"It's like uh it's a very Uh high-tech . "
B,Task,"Bit low-responsive though . "
B,Task,"Prefer pen and paper . "
A,Task,"So that's what we don't want . "
A,Task,"We want a high-responsive product . So "
A,Other,"It looks more like nuclear bomb . "
D,Other,"Very nice dolphin . "
B,Task,"It doesn't look like a nuclear bomb . "
B,Task,"This thing isn't doing what I'm What I want . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"Let's go easy on it . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm well it does look like a nuclear bomb . "
B,Other,"I'll just finish up real soon comm "
B,Minor,"because I'm "
B,Task,"So it doesn't really look like a dolphin comm "
B,Task,"but then again comm this is all new for me . "
A,Minor,"Anyway comm "
A,Minor,"it should It "
A,Task,"It's supposed to be a dolphin comm "
A,Task,"you like the freedom that it that it represents . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"Like the ocean comm "
B,Task,"like swimming . "

C,Task,"Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources . "
A,Elicit,"What does it want ? "
C,Minor,"Uh well comm basically uh "
C,Task,"it hunts for prey comm "
C,Task,"but it does it always in a very well-thought way . "
C,Task,"Uh it knows exactly what it wants . "
C,Task,"It never kills an animal uh just for the killing comm "
C,Task,"so it's very efficient . "
C,Task,"And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And it always goes for uh security comm in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "

B,Elicit,"You've done this before comm haven't you ? "
A,Other,"I love to draw ants . It's my hobby . "
A,Minor,"Anyway Nah . Just "

D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Just Yeah . "
A,Task,"You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have comm and just make it a little distinct . "

A,Other,"See . "
A,Task,"Warning . Finish meeting now . "
A,Other,"Uh put this down . "
A,Other,"Examples . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I guess we have a little little time extra comm "
A,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work . "
A,Elicit,"So what do you guys think about "
A,Task,"The first idea is just very short . "
A,Task,"I'll start with you . "
A,Elicit,"What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Other,"I basically had a question . "
A,Minor,"What "
B,Minor,"Do uh "
B,Elicit,"Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? "
B,Elicit,"Is it just the T_V_ "
B,Minor,"or do we want to in "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control . "
B,Other,"Just for T_V_ remote control . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I guess so . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I was thinking about design remote control comm with our uh motto and all . "
D,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"No rational changes or whatever comm 'cause it revolutionary changes comm "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"so very intuitive design comm I guess . "
B,Task,"yes . "
B,Task,"Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . "
B,Task,"So that was something I wanted to add comm "
B,Task,"and perhaps some usability aspect . "
B,Task,"T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . "
B,Elicit,"Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh comm yeah comm to be able to use it as well ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm we want "
A,Task,"I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . "
A,Task,"So I think I mean comm really disabled people comm yeah comm might be a problem comm "
A,Task,"but I think it's a little take it into consideration . "
A,Minor,"Um yeah . "
A,Task,"I think we really need to cut the meeting short . "
A,Elicit,"You have anything you wanna share quickly ? "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Task,"Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me "
C,Task,"is uh the the material it is made of comm it should be something light . "
C,Minor,"That's "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"it speaks for itself comm "
C,Minor,"but some uh "
A,Other,"It should be light comm okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
