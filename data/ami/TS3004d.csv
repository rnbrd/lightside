A,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"It's not saved yet . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Our beautiful drawing . "
A,Minor,"So just f um "
A,Task,"So this is our agenda . "
A,Minor,"You're "
A,Task,"F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me . "
D,Other,"Oops . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh I didn't "
A,Other,"Oh yeah . "
A,Minor,"So these are the "
C,Task,"Oh comm okay . Yeah . "
A,Task,"So these are the um last notes we I made . "
A,Task,"If anything doesn't look right comm just say it to me then . "
A,Task,"I don't have to put it in the report . "
B,Elicit,"Are we doing the the speech recognition ? "
B,Task,"Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well . "
A,Task,"Okay comm but it's still possible uh uh financially . "
A,Task,"So if you want to comm it's okay . "
B,Task,"Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in . "
A,Task,"Okay comm just "
B,Other,"Yeah comm just uh we have to design the inside then comm "
B,Minor,"but it should be uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm and "
C,Elicit,"Or are we making a slide open comm like underneath ? "
C,Elicit,"Or fold open ? "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls . "
C,Task,"It's probably better . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions . "
B,Task,"It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well . "
A,Task,"Maybe that's better . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's that's a very good point . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so when you have a lot of room inside . "
C,Task,"Think that's better . "
B,Task,"So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So this is okay ? "
B,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm we're gonna use the advanced chip then . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"so that's "
A,Other,"Uh I'll just have a look how much that is . "
C,Minor,"The "
A,Minor,"But um "
B,Elicit,"Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm for the "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I I think so . I don't know . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"No comm you have a different chip for speech recognition . So "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Ah okay . "
A,Task,"So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . "
A,Task,"So it's okay . "
B,Task,"Good . "
A,Task,"So you can show your prototype if you want to . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Together ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's Let's do it together . "
B,Other,"I'll give comments . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we just made a Word file with the basic elements . "
C,Task,"Uh the look-and-feel model . "
C,Task,"Uh well the form comm the case um as drawn there . "
C,Task,"Simply a square with uh round corners . "
C,Task,"So that's basically it . "
C,Task,"Uh the material should be hard plastic . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh colour changeable comm and also transparent . "
C,Task,"And colour and transparent comm or just transparent comm "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
C,Task,"Um then the elements . "
C,Minor,"Uh we have "
C,Task,"The functions are just basic . "
C,Task,"Like uh I've pointed them here . "
C,Task,"Mute function comm on-off function comm text functions . "
C,Task,"This uh switch channel . "
A,Task,"Okay comm cool . "
C,Task,"And this is the "
C,Task,"the num-pad . "
C,Task,"And the logo is over here comm and the mic . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And the scrollwheel comm no ? "
C,Task,"You operate that with your pointing finger . "
D,Minor,"Means "
C,Task,"So you hold it like this in your right hand and "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ? "
B,Task,"Speech recognition . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm speech recognition . "
A,Minor,"Just "
B,Task,"Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . "
A,Elicit,"Only one button to say it's on or off . "
C,Task,"Uh I dunno . "
B,Minor,"Um so I've "
C,Task,"Yeah comm maybe maybe uh you have to configure it . "
B,Task,"Yes comm you need options to configure it comm and after that you don't need 'em anymore . "
A,Task,"So you can put it on the back as well if you want to . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you can put 'em all on the back . That's for sure . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm or or on the slide function comm I don't know . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"That's uh "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Well we haven't had time to design that comm the slide pad . "
B,Task,"We also don't know how many buttons are required comm or what kind of buttons . "
B,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"You have a lot of room if you can slide it open . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm you can put it separate . "
B,Minor,"You "
B,Task,"Yeah I know . "
B,Task,"I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So "
B,Task,"But it's enough room . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Um the position ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm you write uh "
B,Minor,"Uh well "
C,Elicit,"You wrote this comm so . "
B,Task,"Well the main comm the main zap buttons are most central . "
B,Task,"That was the the most important thing . "
B,Minor,"So uh the best place comm "
B,Task,"the best reach place "
B,Task,"Um on-off buttons comm text buttons comm mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are comm easy to find . "
B,Task,"Um the on-off button is a bit bigger comm uh so it stands out . "
B,Task,"That way you don't have to make it red comm 'cause it's will uh will show up . "
B,Task,"Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . "
B,Task,"It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel comm as far as I know . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But it's not uh impossible to use it comm if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Just just one thing now . "
D,Task,"Um y you need to have more uh one two th "
D,Task,"You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . "
B,Task,"Okay yeah comm "
B,Minor,"they "
D,Task,"But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes . "
C,Task,"Mm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah okay . "
B,Task,"That's that's below that then . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"It's uh twelve buttons . "
C,Task,"just so you get that . "
D,Task,"Okay comm but It's rather important . "
B,Task,"Yeah okay comm just we just missed that . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But um I'll just uh "
B,Other,"I'll get back to later . "
B,Task,"F the form well comm we've taken that from the iPod comm other popular technical device . "
B,Task,"So um should be popular . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"The f uh the buttons creating ? "
B,Task,"Uh if you "
B,Task,"That or all round shapes comm not uh rounded corners . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So that comm you know comm you get a bit round feeling . "
B,Task,"Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons comm uh non-rubber buttons . "
B,Task,"Colour changeable . "
B,Task,"Well and um the backlight thing comm the thing that lights up . "
B,Task,"We have decided uh in the the channel buttons comm there's a little uh colour around it . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"And also in the num-pads comm there's also colour light behind it . "
A,Elicit,"And do you still can comm do you still can choose what colour comm kind of colour you want ? "
B,Minor,"So when you pre "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"How do you want to implement that ? "
A,Minor,"Just on the "
B,Minor,"We're going to implement . "
A,Task,"Maybe on the second level as well ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm just a little "
D,Minor,"Ah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm these are just basic functions comm so "
C,Task,"All the non-basic are in "
A,Task,"Okay comm just draw draw the second level comm because we need that as well . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Okay comm there is one uh function I use uh daily comm and it's not on the basic functions . "
D,Task,"It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . "
D,Task,"Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player . "
D,Task,"That function must be "
C,Task,"Okay comm maybe we use this button for the "
D,Task,"Yeah comm maybe "
D,Task,"Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"I um "
A,Task,"Yeah comm as well . "
A,Minor,"Just make make a "
B,Task,"To your video device . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . "
C,Other,"A second level ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Like a a new blank one or Or just here ? "
A,Task,"No no comm just on Down there . "
B,Task,"Is i Ah okay . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So uh "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"And h how does the second level come out ? "
A,Minor,"Just uh if you s "
D,Elicit,"Uh it slides uh along ? "
B,Task,"Um slides I think . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm y Maybe comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"It's "
D,Elicit,"From from the uh beneath ? "
A,Task,"For the bottom . "
B,Task,"You can do it that it claps open comm "
B,Task,"but I think that's not solid enough . "
A,Task,"No comm you gotta slide it . "
B,Task,"If that breaks then you're screwed . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's right . "
B,Task,"So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Elicit,"So what do we need ? "
B,Task,"Uh i the the speech functions buttons . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"just "
D,Task,"Menu ? "
B,Task,"Menu button . "
B,Task,"With uh maybe uh arrows . "
B,Task,"So you can uh "
B,Task,"scroll in the comm navigate the menu . "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Other,"God damn it . "
D,Task,"Scart ? "
B,Minor,"I think we can even put a "
B,Task,"We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels . "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah . "
D,Task,"And so y you keep you keep one comm you have one left . Yes . "
B,Task,"So you have one left for the "
C,Minor,"So this is the "
B,Task,"Right comm the video channel comm Play Station comm etcetera . That's used pretty often . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"If you have a Play Station comm mm you use it every day . "
D,Minor,"It's a f basic uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Extern or something . "
A,Task,"You want to save that file as well ? The drawing ? "
B,Minor,"That was it . "
C,Task,"So here are multiple speech buttons comm "
C,Task,"I don't know how many . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Doesn't really matter . "
C,Task,"I don't know the functions . "
A,Minor,"Just just uh "
B,Task,"It doesn't really matter . "
B,Minor,"That's "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah well we don't have any uh "
C,Elicit,"What else ? "
B,Other,"Hmm ? "
C,Elicit,"What else ? "
B,Other,"What else ? "
B,Task,"Uh menu buttons with arrows . "
C,Task,"Uh menu . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm to navigate . "
C,Elicit,"Uh With arrows . "
B,Minor,"S Just uh like "
B,Task,"Um I think it's best if we do . "
B,Other,"Mm where do we have "
B,Task,"Or there . "
C,Elicit,"Like a normal um "
B,Task,"Like on the normal uh Like this . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah comm with in the middle um a menu button . "
B,Task,"The menu button comm yes . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Well we don't have any comm anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it . "
D,Task,"Mm okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"Uh and and you can hold it comm "
D,Task,"you can hold it comm and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Just press it once comm the colour should uh switch . Press again comm the colour switch again maybe ? "
D,Task,"okay . "
A,Task,"Or we just make it three buttons comm all the colours on it . "
A,Task,"Just red comm yel uh red comm green and "
D,Task,"Okay comm yeah . Th Yeah . "
D,Task,"If we have enough place comm uh then we can do that . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"That's that's very easy comm yeah . "
C,Task,"We can put those here . "
D,Task,"Colour buttons . "
D,Task,"And then we choose green comm uh blue and red or "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"That's uh Um "
C,Elicit,"So did we miss anything ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel comm that it is volume . "
D,Minor,"It "
D,Task,"Some text uh buttons . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm but "
B,Task,"I just uh The volume logo . "
A,Minor,"No comm ma on on o on the on the "
D,Task,"there's one there's one text button I "
C,Elicit,"Oh wh Here ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Just make it "
D,Task,"There's one text button I prefer . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm or th or the "
D,Task,"That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page comm uh like seven hundred comm uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred comm you will switch to your television and back to text . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm we have that on the the text button . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Do you do you "
D,Elicit,"Did you think of that ? "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then "
B,Elicit,"Uh why not ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm just put it on those extra f extra function as well . "
D,Task,"Ex Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"No "
C,Task,"Well w we thought of a text button . "
B,Other,"Whoa "
C,Task,"And if you press it again comm you get the the the "
B,Minor,"I think um "
D,Minor,"The sta the state you "
A,Task,"Oh just three stages comm "
C,Task,"through view . "
A,Minor,"you "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm the three stages . Yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm b but but if you're in the second stage comm the third stage is switch teletext off . "
C,Task,"So you can switch back from second to w first . "
B,Task,"No comm it doesn't have to turn it off . "
D,Task,"No . Just remember where it was . "
B,Minor,"Just don't "
D,Task,"It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"If you if you turn teletext on comm you you set the seven hundred comm and you turn it off comm then the next time you turn it on comm it still stays on seven hundred ? "
A,Task,"Yes comm that's to remember . "
C,Task,"Okay comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but that's that's uh "
D,Task,"But maybe it's not the way "
B,Task,"I dunno if "
A,Task,"That's a functionality for the television . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think as well comm but Uh yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about . "
C,Minor,"Yeah mm nee uh "
C,Minor,"No comm if i "
C,Task,"uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred comm page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"in thi the the remote control in the "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but you have to search every time again . "
C,Minor,"Th i "
B,Elicit,"the chip . "
A,Task,"That's what what happening if you do it like that . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
A,Task,"But it's still the television that has to do that . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I dunno . Okay . "
B,Minor,"So yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Um do we need to fix that or "
D,Task,"Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages . "
A,Task,"No comm that's what the television does . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm those memory functions . "
D,Task,"But uh not not every every television comm so "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm it's cool . "
C,Elicit,"Was uh this logo for uh volume ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's fine . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"So that's it ? "
A,Elicit,"Is this prich pretty much it comm yeah ? "
D,Other,"Yeah comm I I thought about one thing . "
D,Elicit,"Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . No no "
B,Task,"Just like your telephone comm hard plastic . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Just hard plastic . So "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Because um if you use it a couple of years comm some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away comm "
A,Task,"It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway . "
D,Minor,"are uh "
D,Task,"And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? "
D,Elicit,"Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ? "
B,Task,"I think just on the buttons . "
C,Minor,"Uh I think just um "
B,Task,"If you do it abo above or below comm it takes uh more space . "
D,Task,"Well yeah . That's too much place . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm but "
D,Task,"Okay comm just leave it . Just leave it . "
B,Task,"I don't think the space is worth it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm and i "
C,Task,"I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons . "
D,Minor,"The most time "
D,Task,"Yeah comm with rubber buttons . Yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . Fine . "
A,Task,"Yeah ? Okay comm cool . "
A,Other,"Mm mm mm mm mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I don't know what this means . "
A,Task,"But I think we just evela evaluated this one . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I made some criteria uh comm so we can uh ev evaluate our model . "
A,Task,"Oh okay comm you made some criteria . Okay comm cool . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I d d d I don't think if it's right . "
D,Other,"That shall show it . "
A,Elicit,"You have some usability criteria or "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Uh no comm uh all criterias we just argue about . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"In the bottom . "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Look-and-feel ? "
D,Task,"Evaluation crit "
C,Task,"No comm evaluation is "
D,Task,"Yeah comm evaluation presentation . "
D,Task,"It's not in . "
D,Task,"Uh d it doesn't matter um "
D,Task,"It only had two pages or something . "
D,Task,"Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy comm "
D,Task,"or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . "
D,Task,"The Italians uh comm how they think about it . "
D,Minor,"And "
D,Task,"The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . "
D,Task,"I made some criteria comm "
D,Task,"and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . "
D,Task,"We sh we we we can give it uh a number comm and then we can give ourself an average for our "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"um model . "
D,Minor,"And this "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"These are all I I I found comm or I wrote down . "
D,Task,"And um we have to discuss about comm if we give it a one or a seven . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea . It quite beautiful . "
A,Minor,"It's "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"We are actu We are the "
D,Task,"Yeah comm the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . "
D,Task,"And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff . "
A,Minor,"Flashy . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Well I think we do "
D,Task,"The LEDs . "
B,Task,"If it's really uh comm if you can if you can get the iPod look comm then it's beautiful comm I think . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
D,Elicit,"And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ? "
A,Minor,"But uh "
C,Task,"Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste . "
B,Other,"Hmm ? "
D,Elicit,"The basic colours are black or green or yellow ? "
D,Elicit,"Or you haven't thought about "
B,Other,"Um basic colours comm "
B,Task,"um yeah . Well you didn't say . "
D,Minor,"Ho how do we make uh "
B,Task,"Maybe um company colours ? "
A,Task,"It's black . "
D,Task,"Black and yellow . "
B,Task,"Black . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yellow light . "
B,Task,"A bit a bit of yellow . "
D,Minor,"Can "
A,Elicit,"Do we have yellow light ? "
A,Task,"No comm not really comm but it's possible . "
B,Task,"Not not not yellow comm but just a bit of light yellow . "
A,Minor,"It's "
D,Task,"Black white comm maybe ? "
B,Task,"Like white comm also ni or uh always nice . "
C,Elicit,"And what colours should the buttons be ? "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Minor,"Because um "
A,Task,"Yeah comm different colours . "
A,Minor,"This is "
B,Minor,"Just um "
A,Task,"Oh comm the same as th th the cover . "
A,Task,"But also th the light behind it . "
C,Elicit,"But can you change those too comm with uh the switch ? "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"No comm no . "
A,Minor,"Make them "
A,Task,"No comm just make them black or grey or something . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm grey . Just dark grey I think . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Okay comm so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? "
D,Task,"Beautiful is uh really subjective comm uh because it has to do lots with the colours . "
B,Task,"Well we have changeable fronts comm so "
D,Task,"Changeable fronts comm so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"just give it a one . It's okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's perfect . "
A,Task,"I think it's just what you want . "
A,Elicit,"Or not ? "
B,Task,"It's hard to decide for us comm but yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . It's ju so subjective . "
B,Minor,"It it's "
B,Task,"At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm just give it a two . "
D,Task,"A two . Okay . "
D,Task,"The fancy look-and-feel . "
D,Task,"That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And we can change the colours comm so that's uh really fancy I think . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"One more thing . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Are w are we changing uh "
C,Elicit,"Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? "
C,Task,"Or n no back light ? "
D,Other,"Slide panel ? "
C,Task,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"Mm . Not needed . "
A,Task,"No . No comm it's only on the number comm behind the numbers "
B,Task,"Yeah comm not needed I think . "
A,Minor,"and uh "
C,Elicit,"And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too ? "
D,Elicit,"Oh comm you mean th this here ? "
A,Task,"That as well comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but that's unnecessary . "
B,Elicit,"What do I think is necessary necessary item ? "
D,Task,"It's pretty cool . If you slide it open comm it lights up . "
D,Task,"That's that's really fancy comm but I don't know if it's reachable . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Of course it's reachable . "
A,Minor,"It doesn't make "
D,Task,"Then we do it . "
C,Other,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Okay comm maybe just some light uh to to light it all up . "
B,Task,"So you can see what's really there . "
B,Task,"Not just not re on the buttons or something . "
A,Minor,"No . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Just a green light or some blue light . "
B,Task,"To light it all up . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"But Yeah . Mayb Okay . "
D,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"Yeah comm just backlight . "
C,Task,"Not not the buttons . "
C,Task,"And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons comm but behind the buttons . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So the buttons are just grey . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Well yeah . Uh semi-transparent . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm just only Yeah comm that's right . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay comm fine . So I I think it's very fancy . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's how I think . "
D,Minor,"So I'll give it a "
B,Task,"Yeah comm w we've done a a lot of detail in light comm so "
D,Task,"Yeah comm and you can uh also choose your light comm so "
A,Minor,"Ye "
A,Task,"Yeah comm this It is a one . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's okay . It's cool . "
D,Task,"I think it's one . "
D,Task,"Okay comm next . "
A,Task,"This is a difficult one comm because we we don't Yeah comm we don't know it about the "
D,Elicit,"Learnable ? Easy to use ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm we shall test it "
D,Minor,"But uh "
A,Task,"Uh it's it's very easy to use comm but uh the second layer is not easy to use . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"It's That's "
C,Task,"No comm but you don't have to use that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . "
C,Task,"That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it . "
A,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"So I think it's easy to use comm "
B,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"And learnable is a bit "
D,Other,"Learnable ? "
D,Task,"It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . "
C,Task,"Well comm I think it is . "
D,Task,"Because because I think I think the scroll wheel comm uh it's very handy comm but the first time you get this thing in your hands comm it's not to use the scroll wheel . "
B,Minor,"Well y just uh f "
D,Task,"I think uh you must uh seek for it comm and up or down or "
D,Minor,"Uh then the re "
A,Task,"But the rest of it is very easy comm "
A,Minor,"because there are so so n "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think it's very clear what it all does . "
C,Task,"So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But the second parts comm uh like speech comm etcetera comm that will be harder to learn . "
A,Task,"So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"But "
B,Minor,"It's Yeah it's "
A,Task,"And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well comm if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device . "
D,Task,"Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things comm huh ? "
B,Minor,"Device . "
D,Task,"And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . "
D,Task,"So we h we have speech comm uh the scroll wheel comm and um the the the slide . You must slide it . "
D,Task,"And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls . "
D,Task,"'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use . "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Because easy to use comes after learnable . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay comm just Easy to use is very cool comm "
D,Task,"I I think it a three or something . "
A,Task,"so just give it a two . "
B,Task,"Maybe three then . "
B,Minor,"Learnable's "
A,Task,"No comm but definitely better comm much better than uh than uh than avera average comm yeah . "
C,Other,"Mm uh . "
C,Task,"The normal . "
B,Task,"Yeah okay . Yeah . "
C,Task,"And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know "
B,Task,"Yep comm true . "
B,Task,"Then a two . "
D,Task,"Oh . Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"New features . Techno technological innovative ? "
C,Task,"The speech function and the colour . Colour . "
D,Task,"The speech function is new . "
B,Task,"And the scrollwheel comm backlights comm slide . "
D,Task,"The scrollwheel "
D,Task,"and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new . "
A,Task,"Slide is not n is is not new . No . "
A,Minor,"I already have a "
D,Task,"Uh I only saw it in a telephone comm not in an remote control . "
A,Task,"Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So that's not new . "
B,Elicit,"But also slide that buttons come out comm as well ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Okay comm and the the the lightning ? "
A,Task,"That's cool . "
D,Elicit,"Is that new ? "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"for a Uh for a f "
D,Task,"The lighting's new . "
C,Task,"Mm it's pretty new comm I think . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Scrollwheel . "
D,Elicit,"Speech ? "
C,Task,"Speech is new . "
B,Task,"Different colours comm so "
D,Task,"Yeah comm different fronts for a remote control comm I think that's new too . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So we have a pretty new uh "
A,Task,"There are no games on it comm that's that's It's not a one comm it's a two again . "
B,Minor,"That would "
B,Minor,"And we didn't uh "
D,Task,"It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something . "
B,Task,"But then we also have the the home station . "
A,Minor,"If you have "
B,Task,"We are forgetting about that now comm but "
A,Task,"Yeah . Oh yeah comm that's right . Rechargeable . "
D,Minor,"Uh-oh . "
D,Minor,"Home-station . "
B,Minor,"We don't "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we didn't draw that too comm but "
B,Minor,"recharge . "
B,Task,"But that's more like uh now . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm just draw it afterwards . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's just a normal th s simple thing . "
B,Minor,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"If you "
A,Task,"Can you save it on the same comm in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ? "
B,Minor,"Uh "
B,Elicit,"Just save comm save as ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Uh save as ? "
A,Task,"No comm that's not in the project . "
C,Task,"Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Smart board . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but this one . "
A,Task,"This one is not yet in the "
A,Other,"Oh oh . "
C,Task,"I think it is . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it is . "
C,Task,"No comm I think it is . "
B,Elicit,"Uh untitled ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it doesn't matter . "
B,Other,"Save . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Uh all the the seven comm uh all the seven . "
A,Task,"But you still have to draw the resi the recharger . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . And new features comm so we give it a two or also again a one ? "
A,Task,"No comm I think i if you have games on it comm then then you give you have a one . "
D,Task,"No comm we are not extraordinary new or something . "
A,Minor,"But not "
A,Task,"No comm just so it's still a two . "
D,Minor,"Tha tha that "
C,Task,"Mm two comm I think . "
B,Minor,"N "
A,Task,"Targeted audience . "
A,Task,"Uh we are the targeted audience ? "
A,Elicit,"Do we like it ? "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"we we we searched for uh um a young group comm audience comm beneath f forty . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but l younger than forty . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"So we we are exactly the targeted group . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah comm but did we reach comm um with our uh style comm the targeted audience ? "
D,Task,"Th that's my question . "
A,Task,"I think so comm yeah . "
A,Task,"You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel comm and that's what attracts the young audience . So "
A,Minor,"So you want "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh That's that's That's this question . "
C,Task,"think that's a two or a one . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but s it That's basically not not handy . "
C,Minor,"And I don't thi I don't see "
D,Task,"Yeah comm this . "
D,Task,"So we targeted it ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But we didn't follow the latest trends . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm you could make a a front "
B,Task,"Mm . I think we followed the latest trends . "
C,Task,"a front that's that's like uh like a banana comm or something . "
D,Task,"Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh get on my computer . "
B,Task,"Oh right . Well uh fruit and vegetables comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm you get different colours . "
B,Task,"You can different front uh "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah comm th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Like a a f banana kind of front . "
D,Task,"Oh yeah . "
D,Task,"But spongy will never be . "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"So we give ourself a three or something . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So that's eleven . "
D,Minor,"That's uh "
D,Elicit,"What's the average ? "
C,Elicit,"Eleven divided by six . "
A,Minor,"It's "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it is one point eight three . "
D,Task,"A perfect score . "
D,Task,"No comm I don't know . "
C,Task,"We're not too hard on ourselves . "
B,Task,"This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And and you need n uh a button to call it comm to let it beep . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"To call . "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Oh yeah comm that's still "
D,Minor,"Call "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm maybe we have to skip that one . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"That's Yeah comm but it "
B,Task,"No no comm I want that in . "
C,Task,"But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo . "
D,Task,"No comm we need that . That's usable . That's really usable . "
C,Minor,"If you do uh "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm th the speaker is very small as well comm "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Minor,"It's uh "
A,Other,"So I just got a financial um "
B,Minor,"Yes uh . "
A,Elicit,"You s saved it or "
D,Task,"Yeah . I did save it . "
A,Other,"No . "
A,Task,"Okay comm let's have a look at this one here comm the production cost of it . "
A,Task,"If I forgot anything comm just say it to me . "
A,Task,"It just is a battery . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm there are some that they didn't mention comm because recharge is not on the list . "
A,Task,"But okay . "
A,Task,"So I think we are pretty much in the right direction comm because it's twelve point three Euros . "
C,Task,"Mm okay . "
C,Minor,"But uh is uh uh "
D,Task,"That's fine . "
A,Task,"So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So that's both . "
D,Task,"Come on comm it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm and single curved curved . "
C,Elicit,"But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or "
A,Task,"No comm that's not on the list . "
A,Minor,"But that shouldn't be . "
C,Elicit,"Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm we can uh "
A,Task,"Probably . "
A,Minor,"I just "
A,Elicit,"The b the button supplements comm I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was "
B,Task,"Um different fronts comm but standard front won't be comm yeah . "
A,Task,"I'm not sure . "
A,Minor,"See it's "
A,Task,"I think it's okay like this . "
D,Other,"Special form comm yeah . "
A,Task,"It's hard to say . "
A,Minor,"But maybe we have to um "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"Special colour comm you can skip this one comm because it's all quite normal . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We get different ones comm that's all . "
A,Task,"So you can put a recharger in it as well . "
A,Task,"But this is expensive comm the sample speaker . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"This ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's four . "
D,Task,"Four . It's four Euros . "
B,Task,"Oh comm them . "
B,Elicit,"Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So we are "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's included . "
C,Task,"It's kind of weird that we we get this information now comm afterwards . "
B,Task,"Okay comm then we then we need to use it . "
C,Minor,"Because "
A,Task,"Yeah comm no . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so this is uh pretty much it this . "
B,Task,"Damn comm solar cells are uh expensive . "
A,Minor,"So I just want you "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we just made it . "
A,Task,"So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We can do some discussion about this . "
A,Elicit,"Was there room for creativity ? "
C,Task,"Sure . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Paul comm was there room for crea creativity ? "
C,Task,"Beautiful . "
B,Task,"Mm uh i Yeah comm I think so . "
B,Task,"I think uh everyone uh already . So "
C,Task,"Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Or a different style . "
C,Task,"then there we probably have been creative . "
B,Task,"I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So it's creativity . "
C,Other,"Huh . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so the leadership "
A,Elicit,"Was there a leadership and "
B,Task,"Of course there was . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"What do you have to say about that ? "
C,Minor,"No comm I think "
D,Other,"Who was the leader ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"I dunno . "
C,Task,"Just normal discussion comm I think . Not "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"one leader or something . "
B,Task,"One leader to check the time comm etcetera . "
C,Task,"Yeah . And make notes . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I know . "
B,Other,"So more like a secretary . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm next one . "
A,Task,"Uh team work "
A,Minor,"um The "
A,Task,"the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . "
A,Task,"We were not all We were not um agree with every not agree with . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah . We were not finished . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm w we had so much information comm that we get through email and just "
A,Task,"We're not finished . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time . "
B,Task,"I think that was the m biggest problem . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Like uh the prices . "
B,Task,"If we knew that before comm we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm th that's weird . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm and if you had uh fifteen Euros comm then we would it . "
D,Minor,"And then "
B,Minor,"We had to "
C,Task,"Hmm hmm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm finance . "
C,Task,"So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But the teamwork was okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . "
D,Minor,"And uh "
B,Task,"I think uh everyone listen to each other . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm what I have to say about uh means . "
A,Task,"The smart board is okay . "
A,Task,"Digital pen is horrible . "
A,Task,"I dunno if you use it . "
A,Task,"But if you want to download it to your computer comm it's doesn't work . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"It was "
B,Elicit,"Just doesn't work . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with comm if it worked really well . "
D,Other,"Digital pen or "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm i if if it would be faster comm it would be great . "
B,Task,"Just not work too slow . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm the drawings are are hard to make comm I think . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm more accurate . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's i It should be more accurate . "
D,Task,"Precise . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from comm just with a mouse comm from where you're sitting . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Not just pointing out on it . "
A,Task,"It's the same for the presenta for the presentations . "
A,Task,"You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"And so you've "
C,Task,"Yeah comm and p just point with a mouse . "
B,Task,"No use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But you might as well do it in normal computer style . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"like . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm even harder to draw like this than black board style . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And it's far too slow this way . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"You cou You could draw on it comm but not as main function . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"I think "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Other,"Digital pen . "
A,Task,"So we made it in time . "
A,Task,"And we made a remote control . "
B,Task,"We did it . "
A,Task,"In the budget comm yeah . "
B,Other,"New ideas found . "
D,Other,"New ideas . "
C,Elicit,"What's that ? "
B,Other,"Oh "
D,Minor,"For for for "
A,Task,"I don't know what it mean . "
A,Minor,"Just "
B,Minor,"I just think if we uh "
D,Elicit,"To gather comm or to uh work together comm uh or new ideas for "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"For remote control probably . "
A,Task,"No comm for the project . "
B,Task,"For remote control comm a favourite for your text . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"No comm for the prototype . New ideas . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but still comm you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and "
A,Task,"Yeah . But it's for the next team . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time comm I think . "
A,Task,"We don't have to do that . "
B,Minor,"That's for . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm this this is just the idea phase comm "
B,Minor,"the "
C,Task,"Yeah comm just brainstorming basically . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Details uh "
C,Elicit,"So are we finished ? "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Other,"I think just I just write a final report . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Quite early . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"we have only four minutes left . "
A,Task,"Uh it's okay . "
C,Task,"Oh okay . "
B,Elicit,"Oh comm what do we have to do now . "
B,Minor,"Do we uh "
B,Task,"I thought we were done at four o'clock ? "
C,Task,"It's now quarter past three . So "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Other,"I should take some pictures uh . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Mm we can do it afterwards comm so "
D,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Let's play minesweeper . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I found it as well . "
D,Other,"Ti-din ti-din . "
B,Task,"One two three four five six seven cameras . "
B,Minor,"Mm not bad . "
B,Task,"So that was it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Now we can look at this . "
B,Elicit,"This is "
C,Task,"We're probably not supposed to look at this comm but "
B,Task,"The old versions . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm from the previous group . "
B,Task,"They went for uh for a universal device . "
C,Task,"The touchscreen comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but also a different device . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Then an L_C_D_ uh would be handy . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Here are the basic functions in here comm the selecting dev devices . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm and touch screens for all our stuff comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"I do agree with that . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm tu-dum . "
B,Task,"English is not so hard by the way . "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"I'm breaking a world record here . "
B,Elicit,"Well comm leader ? "
D,Other,"Oh shit . "
B,Elicit,"Project Manager ? "
D,Task,"We've got a problem comm Paul . "
B,Elicit,"You do ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you have to make a choice . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"No it's your choice . "
B,Task,"Wow comm that's pretty quick . "
D,Other,"Tu-dum . "
B,Other,"Uh uh um "
D,Task,"Just pick one . "
B,Task,"You have to decide . "
B,Task,"It's the lower one . "
D,Elicit,"What's this ? A bomb or not a bo "
B,Task,"No no comm the upper one is the bomb . "
D,Elicit,"This the bomb ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Wrong . "
D,Task,"Shit . "
B,Task,"I knew it . "
D,Task,"I knew it . "
D,Task,"Four in a row . "
B,Task,"No . That's too much work . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Other,"Come on . "
D,Elicit,"Is that previous work ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm this one . "
B,Other,"I challenge you . "
D,Task,"Oh comm that's so stupid . "
D,Task,"No comm that doesn't work . "
B,Task,"No comm you gotta use the magic pen . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Elicit,"What if I put one there ? "
D,Task,"That's stupid . "
B,Task,"We'll see . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I don't agree . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you had two choices . "
B,Task,"That's gonna be draw . "
B,Task,"Or not . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Too bad . "
B,Other,"I'll put it here . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm then I put it there . "
B,Task,"You are going to put it there . "
D,Task,"No one wins . "
B,Task,"It's a difficult choice comm either here or there . "
C,Task,"This is a very interesting design . "
B,Task,"Ugly . "
D,Task,"It's just the same as normal . "
B,Minor,"Oh a pen . "
C,Task,"Well it has a L_C_D_ comm I think . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Then do it correctly . "
D,Other,"Stupid design . Stupid . "
C,Other,"And what else do we have ? "
B,Other,"Stupid comm the L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Other,"'Kay wait comm "
D,Other,"I'm going to draw something "
D,Minor,"and you must y "
B,Elicit,"What ? "
B,Other,"Okay comm I'm going to guess what you're drawing . "
D,Task,"Okay comm blank . "
B,Task,"No no comm the new one . "
D,Task,"Oh . "
B,Task,"Uh they just don't save it . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"I know uh . "
B,Elicit,"A house ? "
B,Other,"Yeah comm you have to use the pen s stupid . "
A,Task,"You have to save everything comm "
A,Elicit,"you know that comm huh ? "
B,Task,"No comm not everything . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm everything . "
B,Task,"Pen comm select select pen . "
D,Minor,"Pen . "
C,Task,"It wants to know what we do in our spare time . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"It's a house . "
B,Elicit,"A plant ? "
D,Task,"No comm it's Only you can know it . "
B,Task,"Oh yeah comm I can know it . "
B,Minor,"It's a "
D,Task,"It's uh very hard to draw . "
B,Task,"Okay comm that makes it easier . "
B,Task,"I think I know . "
B,Task,"No comm wrong . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I think I know what you're trying to draw comm but it's wrong already . "
D,Minor,"It's very "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you missed the right side . "
D,Other,"Fuck . F "
B,Task,"No comm you're wrong comm you're wrong "
D,Task,"A little bit maybe comm but "
B,Elicit,"See where you're wrong now ? "
B,Task,"The entrance . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Warning . Finish meeting now . "
