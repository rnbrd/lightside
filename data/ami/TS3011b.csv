Speaker,Negotiation,DialogAct,TextA,d,Other,Welcome back . B,d,Other,Hello . D,d,Other,Hello . A,d,Minor,Uh let me see . B,K1,Task,There's one of mine . A,f,Task,Okay . A,f,Other,"Roo , welcome back . "B,d,Other,"Hello , Flores . "A,K1,Task,The waiting is for Sebastian . B,d,Minor,. A,K1,Task,There he is . B,K1,Task,We have a slight problem . C,K2,Elicit,Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? B,K1,Task,I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys . A,tr,Other,Sorry ? C,tr,Elicit,Can I get a cup of coffee ? A,K1,Task,"Uh no . You can't , "C,f,Other,Okay . A,f,Other,sorry . B,f,Minor,So B,A2,Task,just cancel it . C,d,Minor,"Well , "C,K1,Task,during my work I have no time either . C,f,Minor,So A,d,Minor,"Well , "A,K1,Other,this is life . A,f,Other,Sorry A,d,Other,"uh , Roo . "B,f,Minor,"Yeah , "B,K1,Task,I opened the C_D_ ROM box . Accidentally . A,f,Other,Okay . A,f,Minor,Okay . B,K1,Task,But it's alright . A,K1,Other,"People , welcome back with the second meeting . "A,K1,Task,Um for now on the schedule are a few points . A,K1,Task,"Uh first of all the opening , "A,K1,Task,which we are doing now . A,K1,Task,"Um second , I received um some new project requirements . "A,K1,Task,"I'm not sure if you received them as well , "A,K1,Other,um but I will tell you about it . B,f,Minor,Mm-hmm . A,K2,Elicit,"Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? "A,K2,Elicit,Sebastian ? C,K1,Task,I think so too . A,K2,Elicit,Roo ? B,K1,Task,Yeah . A,K2,Elicit,Ruud ? D,K1,Task,Almost . A,f,Other,"Almost , okay . "A,K1,Task,Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . A,K1,Minor,Um the top goal of this m B,K1,Task,"But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . "A,K1,Task,Um we will figure that out . B,f,Task,Okay . A,A2,Minor,Ca can you try to D,A1,Other,Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the . A,f,Minor,"Yeah , "A,K1,Task,w we will see . B,K1,Task,I don't think it's wireless here . A,K1,Task,"Um it is , yeah . Yeah . "C,K1,Task,It is . B,K2,Elicit,Or it is . C,K1,Task,It is . B,f,Elicit,Yeah ? B,f,Task,"Okay , great . "D,f,Other,Uh okay . A,K1,Task,"Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , "A,A2,Task,so keep that in mind . Um A,K1,Task,we have forty minutes . A,d,Minor,So A,d,Task,it's now A,d,Minor,Yep . Okay . Um A,K1,Task,"the new project requirements , "A,K1,Task,"first of all , um we didn't speak about it , "A,K1,Task,"but we should not um support teletext in the remote , "A,K1,Task,um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date A,K1,Task,and internet is replacing teletext . A,K1,Task,So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . A,K1,Task,It's a board decision . A,K1,Task,"Um the remote control should only be used for television , "A,K1,Task,"because it's not uh f uh feasible , "A,K1,Minor,it's not uh w B,f,Minor,Yeah . A,K1,Task,uh uh we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with . B,f,Minor,"Time , yeah . "A,K1,Task,"Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , "A,K1,Task,"which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . "A,K1,Task,Because the product should um be uh interesting A,K1,Task,and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um A,K1,Task,"then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . "A,K1,Task,So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product . B,f,Other,Yes . A,K2,Elicit,Is that clear ? A,K2,Elicit,Any questions on these requirements ? A,f,Elicit,No ? A,f,Minor,Okay . A,K1,Task,"Um the individual presentations , "A,d,Minor,I th A,A2,Elicit,"um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? "B,A1,Task,"Yeah , I'll start . "A,f,Task,"Uh uh yeah . Okay , "C,K1,Minor,Yes . A,f,Other,great . B,d,Minor,"Um Oh , "B,K2,Minor,how can I uh B,f,Other,"Geez , "B,f,Other,and sli and show . B,A1,Elicit,Um Just uh press it . B,f,Task,Uh yes . B,f,Minor,Alright . Um well B,K1,Task,w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . B,K1,Minor,Uh the method of the remote control is just B,K1,Task,the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . B,K1,Task,So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . A,f,Minor,Yeah . B,K1,Task,"Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , "B,K1,Task,"the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . "A,f,Minor,Mm-hmm . B,K1,Task,And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . A,f,Minor,Yeah . B,d,Minor,Um but um yeah . B,K1,Task,"My personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control , "B,K1,Task,because uh the user-friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design . B,K1,Task,But um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old . A,f,Minor,Uh-huh . B,K1,Task,So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . B,K1,Task,"But it should b I think it should be a combination , "B,K1,Task,but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . B,K1,Task,"So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . "B,K1,Task,"But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . "A,f,Other,Okay . A,K2,Elicit,"Uh Ruud , did you get that ? "D,K1,Other,"Yeah , uh b uh most . "B,f,Minor,Yeah . A,d,Minor,"Okay , so "A,K1,Task,the important thing here is B,K1,Task,And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic . D,d,Minor,"Oh , "D,K1,Task,user-friendly . A,K1,Task,"In the market , "B,f,Task,"Yeah , "A,f,Task,yeah . B,K2,Elicit,what what does the market want ? B,K1,Task,I I don't know . A,f,Minor,"Yeah , okay , "A,d,Minor,w we will s we all uh B,K1,Task,Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control . A,f,Other,Yeah . A,f,Minor,Okay . A,A2,Task,Sebastian . C,A1,Minor,Okay . C,f,Other,Excuse me . B,f,Other,Scusi . C,d,Minor,"Um Okay , "C,K1,Task,it's still the right thing . C,d,Minor,"Okay . Um well , "C,K1,Task,"there are some changes in the design requirements , "C,K1,Task,so there are some changes in the method also . C,K1,Task,Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . C,K1,Task,And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . C,d,Minor,"Well , "C,d,Minor,I th C,K1,Task,"I tried to uh implement a picture here , "C,K1,Task,but it's hardly readable . B,K1,Minor,Energies and uh C,K2,Elicit,Can you see it ? A,K1,Task,"No , it's not visible . "C,K2,Other,No ? C,f,Minor,"Well Um , "C,K1,Task,there's a energy source here . C,K1,Minor,And um basically C,d,Minor,there C,K1,Task,it's connected to three things . C,K1,Task,"The user interface connected to a chip , "C,K1,Task,"which is connected to the sender , "C,K1,Task,"which generates messages using uh infrared light , "C,K1,Task,which are sent to the receiver . C,K1,Task,That's basically the idea . C,K1,Task,"And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . "C,d,Minor,Okay . Um C,d,Task,what have I found . C,K1,Task,"Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . "C,K1,Task,That's all . C,K1,Task,"It's cased together , nothing more than that . "C,K1,Task,It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . B,f,Minor,Yeah . C,K1,Task,"There are some exceptions , "C,K1,Task,but most of all have uh infrared controls . C,K1,Task,And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . C,K1,Minor,And I think that's what we w B,K1,Task,The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed . C,f,Task,yes . C,d,Minor,In the C,K1,Task,and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also . C,K1,Task,So maybe we should consider that . A,f,Minor,Yeah . A,f,Minor,Okay . C,f,Minor,Okay . C,K1,Task,I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . C,K1,Task,Um basically this is all there is . C,K1,Task,There's just one chip . C,K1,Task,There are a few buttons connected . C,K1,Task,Uh the buttons are lit . C,K1,Task,"And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , "C,K1,Task,and there is not a power source here . C,d,Minor,So C,K1,Task,that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . C,K1,Task,There's nothing more to it . A,K1,Task,So it's fairly easy . C,K1,Task,It's fairly easy . C,K1,Task,"It's been done many times before , "C,K1,Task,and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . A,f,Minor,Okay . B,K1,Task,Succeed in it also . A,f,Minor,"Okay , "C,d,Minor,"So Okay , so uh "A,f,Other,good . C,K1,Task,"personally I think we should infra use infrared , "C,K1,Task,because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . C,K1,Task,So I think that uh should be clear . A,f,Minor,Okay . C,K1,Task,"Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . "C,K1,Task,Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components C,K1,Task,which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . C,K1,Task,"And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . "C,K1,Task,"Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , "C,K1,Task,um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . A,f,Minor,Okay . C,K1,Task,"And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . "C,K1,Task,I think our uh users will really uh will really like that . B,K2,Minor,And what's the um B,K2,Elicit,"if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy "B,f,Minor,or C,K1,Task,"No , "C,K1,Task,they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . B,f,Other,Okay . C,K1,Task,So we can use them . C,K1,Task,So that's no problem . B,K1,Elicit,"For the same costs , "C,K1,Task,"Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , "B,K1,Minor,it's can be uh in our C,d,Minor,but by uh um um making B,K1,Task,Combined with the low-cost circuit board B,d,Minor,so it's uh C,K1,Task,We can we can make its I think . D,d,Minor,Well D,K1,Task,"you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching . "B,f,Task,Yeah . A,f,Task,Yeah . D,d,Minor,Or A,d,Minor,"Yeah , "A,K1,Task,"but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . "C,f,Minor,Okay . B,d,Minor,But I think C,f,Minor,Hmm . D,f,Task,"Hmm , true . "B,f,Minor,"Yeah , "B,K1,Task,"I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , "B,f,Minor,and not for C,f,Minor,"Yes . Well , "C,K1,Task,"it's not one light , "C,d,Minor,it C,K1,Task,there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . B,K1,Task,"Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think . "C,K1,Task,"No no no , no . That's right , that's right . "A,f,Minor,Okay . C,d,Minor,"So well , "C,K1,Task,this uh should be it . A,f,Minor,Okay . C,K1,Task,Um have a think about it . A,f,Task,Yeah . A,d,Minor,"Okay , "D,K1,Task,"Oh , mine is already outdated . "A,d,Task,Ruud . A,d,Minor,"Okay well , "A,K1,Task,we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product . D,f,Minor,Since uh A,K1,Other,So any income is welcome . Input . D,d,Minor,"Okay , "D,d,Minor,make D,d,Minor,Well Uh D,K1,Task,then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . D,K1,Task,Of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million . B,A2,Elicit,Could you step a little bit more to the right ? A,A1,Minor,Okay . B,f,Task,"Yeah , "D,K1,Task,"But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , "B,f,Other,thank you . D,K1,Task,I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . D,K1,Task,"But uh since uh the requirements changed , "D,K1,Task,that's uh not a good idea . D,f,Minor,"Uh well , "D,A1,Other,skip this . A,f,Task,Yeah . D,d,Minor,"Well , "D,d,Minor,it's D,K1,Task,"this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . "D,K1,Task,"The buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times , "D,K1,Task,when uh the power button is only used one time . D,K1,Task,And the volume button's only four times . D,K1,Task,So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . D,K1,Task,And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . C,f,Minor,Mm . D,K1,Task,So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . A,f,Other,Okay . D,d,Minor,Or A,d,Minor,"Well , "A,K1,Task,that's interesting . C,K1,Task,"Or a find a finding function , "B,f,Minor,Yeah . A,f,Minor,"Yeah , "C,d,Minor,you know . C,K1,Minor,That's quite a A,K1,Task,that's definitely interesting . C,f,Task,yes . A,K1,Task,It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . B,K1,Other,Sound signal . D,f,Task,Yeah . B,f,Task,Yeah . A,d,Minor,"Okay , "C,f,Minor,Yes . A,A2,Task,go on . D,d,Minor,"Well , "D,K1,Task,I just said that . D,d,Minor,"And uh well , "D,d,Task,"this obvious , "D,K1,Task,and he also said it . A,f,Minor,Okay . So A,K1,Task,that's what the market tells us . D,K1,Task,"Uh that's about it , yes . "A,f,Other,Yep . Okay . B,K1,Task,The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . D,K1,Task,Uh mo uh zap buttons most . B,f,Minor,So D,K1,Task,"Volume , they are uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So "B,f,Minor,"Yeah , well "B,K1,Task,it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . C,f,Minor,Yes . B,d,Minor,And first um C,K1,Task,"Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . "B,f,Task,Yeah . A,f,Task,Yep . C,d,Minor,"Well , "C,K1,Minor,the technical uh there C,K1,Task,I think there are no technical difficulties . C,K1,Task,There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . C,d,Minor,So um C,K1,Task,I don't think we have any hiccups there . C,K1,Task,So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . C,K1,Task,So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal . B,f,Task,"Yeah , "B,K1,Task,the sound signal . B,d,Minor,Just one thing B,K2,Elicit,"I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? "D,f,Task,"Yeah , that's uh a problem . Yeah . "C,d,Minor,Well C,K1,Task,Yes . Th that's a bit of that's a problem . B,K1,Task,Another device is not a solution . A,d,Minor,Well A,K1,Task,"maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , "C,d,Minor,Usually B,d,Minor,It should be uh uh A,K1,Task,like um turning on and off the the the lights . C,f,Task,Oh yes . B,d,Task,"Yeah , "B,K1,Task,but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it . C,f,Minor,"Yes . Well , "C,K1,Task,there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . C,K1,Task,"Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . "C,K1,Task,You press it C,K1,Task,"and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , "C,K1,Task,and your uh remote controls then start to beep . A,K1,Minor,Reports rep respend response to it . C,d,Minor,And um B,d,Task,"Yeah , "B,K1,Task,just like uh the phones C,f,Task,"Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing . "B,d,Minor,the D,f,Minor,Yeah . A,d,Minor,But uh th B,K1,Task,But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh C,f,Task,"No , "C,K1,Task,so we we should use something else . D,d,Minor,And you D,d,Minor,"Yeah , "A,f,Minor,"Yeah , "D,d,Minor,and usually A,K1,Minor,because we do not have a a a a a home um B,K1,Minor,But I believe you will have an C,K1,Task,We do not control the T_V_ set so well . D,K1,Task,"And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ , "C,f,Task,"Yes , m yes . "C,f,Minor,S C,K1,Task,"and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , "D,f,Minor,and it's A,d,Minor,Okay . C,A1,Minor,so we should think about A,d,Minor,So A,K2,Elicit,what about the clapping technique ? A,f,Minor,Um because you se B,K1,Task,I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us . C,K1,Task,It's quite complicated . C,d,Minor,"Well , "C,K1,Task,it's quite complicated . C,K1,Elicit,Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds . D,d,Minor,And b A,d,Minor,"Well , "A,K1,Task,you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh C,f,Task,"Yes , yes . "C,d,Minor,"Well , basically "C,K1,Task,"the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , "A,f,Task,"Yeah , a peak . Yeah . "C,K1,Task,which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time . A,f,Minor,Yeah . C,K1,Task,But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . D,K1,Task,"So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep . "A,K1,Task,"Yeah , that's true . "C,f,Task,"Yes , "C,K1,Task,so we don't want that . B,K1,Task,But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something . C,K1,Minor,Maybe we can C,K1,Other,Something like that . B,f,Minor,Well C,d,Minor,"Well , "B,K1,Minor,if you lost th C,K2,Elicit,is there not something f something more easily A,f,Minor,Well uh B,K1,Task,I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . C,d,Minor,"Well , "C,K1,Task,I don't think uh . B,f,Minor,Uh that's just uh C,f,Minor,"No , "C,d,Minor,and y the C,K1,Task,"the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , "A,f,Minor,Yeah . C,d,Minor,so C,K1,Minor,w we should use have C,K1,Task,uh we should use something like that . C,K1,Task,"You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . "B,K1,Task,just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility . C,f,Task,"Yes , something like that . "C,K1,Task,"But that will be very costly , I think . "C,K1,Task,So that's not a good idea . A,f,Minor,"Yeah , "A,K1,Task,"m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . "D,f,Minor,Yeah . C,f,Minor,Mm-hmm . A,A2,Task,"Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , "C,A1,Task,I will . B,f,Minor,Yeah . C,f,Minor,Yes . A,K1,Task,because that's his his field of expertise . C,f,Minor,Yes . C,K1,Task,But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated A,f,Minor,Mm-hmm . C,K1,Task,um and it will become more costly also . A,f,Minor,Yep . C,K1,Task,Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . C,K1,Minor,And there are some implepe imp B,K2,Elicit,"And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ? "C,d,Minor,"Well , "C,K1,Task,"I I think so , "C,K1,Task,"because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . "B,K1,Task,It's a unique item uh C,f,Minor,So A,K1,Task,"Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . "B,K1,Task,It will be an a unique feature of our remote control . A,K1,Minor,It's a different D,f,Minor,Yeah . A,K1,Task,"exactly . It's an uni an unique feature , "B,f,Minor,Yeah . A,K1,Task,and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and probably more i interesting than uh than the lights . B,K1,Task,"And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . "A,f,Minor,Yeah . B,K2,Elicit,What should we choose in in design ? A,f,Other,Yeah . A,d,Minor,"Well , um "A,K1,Task,"according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . "B,K1,Task,"Well , the extra functions . "A,d,Minor,So D,K1,Other,I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here . A,f,Task,Okay . D,d,Minor,"Well , t uh "D,K1,Task,we won't support teletext D,K1,Task,which which was the third-most the second-most used function . B,K1,Task,Used option . A,f,Other,Okay . A,d,Minor,"Well , "C,f,Minor,Okay . A,K1,Other,"we we do have a wise board , "A,K1,Other,so I'm not questioning that . D,f,Minor,"Uh well yeah , "D,K1,Task,channel selection is obviously the most important . A,f,Other,Yeah . A,d,Minor,"Okay , so "A,K1,Task,"on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . "D,f,Minor,So D,d,Minor,Yeah . Yeah . A,d,Minor,"Well , "A,A1,Task,we skip that . D,,Minor,So B,,Minor,"Well , "A,,Task,Okay . B,,Task,so it just th the basic functions . B,,Task,And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff . C,,Task,"No , no . "A,,Task,No . B,,Minor,So D,,Task,Nope . C,,Minor,So C,,Task,that's out of the question . B,,Task,Yeah . A,,Task,Yeah . C,,Minor,So B,,Task,Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . A,,Task,Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one . C,,Task,I think also . C,,Minor,"Yes . Well , "B,,Minor,So C,,Task,we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions A,,Minor,No . C,,Task,and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface A,,Minor,Yeah . C,,Minor,and A,,Minor,"Okay , "A,,Elicit,"Ruud , how do you feel about that ? "A,,Elicit,"Uh do you agree , "A,,Elicit,do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple D,,Minor,Uh well D,,Task,"if we um include other uh innovative functions uh then they uh might , "A,,Minor,Mm-hmm . D,,Task,'cause young people uh like new features . A,,Minor,Mm yeah . D,,Minor,So C,,Task,"Yeah , that's right . "A,,Minor,"Okay , so "C,,Minor,Mm . A,,Minor,this is is kind of uh B,,Task,"Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . "C,,Task,Okay . C,,Minor,"Well , "C,,Minor,is it C,,Task,maybe there's another possibility . C,,Task,"You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , "C,,Task,uh because it has many functions . A,,Minor,Yeah . C,,Task,"Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , "C,,Minor,but um nevertheless A,,Minor,But but are we not in in the in the manual uh A,,Elicit,"I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh "C,,Minor,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . C,,Other,Ok like that . C,,Minor,"Well , "C,,Task,"I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . "C,,Task,I don't know if if it's user-friendly . C,,Task,That's your field of expertise . B,,Minor,"Yeah , "A,,Elicit,But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? B,,Task,I don't know yet . A,,Task,Because we do not implement uh a user history . C,,Other,Mm-hmm . C,,Task,"There's no , but there's no way to do that , "C,,Task,because we cannot implement that kind of the system . A,,Elicit,"I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um "C,,Minor,W C,,Minor,Mm-hmm . C,,Minor,"Well , "C,,Task,maybe we can use a light for that . C,,Task,"When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . "C,,Task,"So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . "C,,Task,Something like that . D,,Task,"And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . "A,,Task,Yeah . C,,Task,Yes . A,,Task,Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . B,,Minor,But does it uh I B,,Task,"then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round "B,,Minor,m B,,Minor,"well , "B,,Minor,should we just use a A,,Minor,"Yeah , "A,,Task,draw draw it on the board . B,,Minor,Um it's already uh B,,Task,"oh , we have a blank . "B,,Other,Oh . C,,Minor,Oh C,,Task,"yeah , something like that . "C,,Task,"It's not really a stick , "B,,Task,It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . C,,Minor,but C,,Minor,Yes . Yes . B,,Task,A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down C,,Minor,Hmm . A,,Task,"Yeah , it can break down . "B,,Minor,or uh C,,Minor,"Yes , yes . "D,,Minor,Yeah . B,,Task,"just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . "C,,Minor,And C,,Task,"Yes , "C,,Task,"and this also looks more fancy , I think . "C,,Task,"I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . "B,,Task,Yeah . D,,Minor,A younger uh Huh . C,,Task,But you're the marketing man . D,,Task,"And it's also quite easy to use , "D,,Task,"so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new , "D,,Task,and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . B,,Other,Geez . B,,Minor,"Well , "B,,Task,volume and something uh like that . A,,Other,Uh-huh . B,,Task,The programme up and down . A,,Other,"Okay , yeah . "B,,Minor,And the vol B,,Minor,"yeah , "B,,Task,the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . C,,Task,"Okay , that's good . "A,,Minor,"Okay , "A,,Task,but w we still we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . A,,Task,Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . A,,Task,"Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . "A,,Task,We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . C,,Minor,Mm-hmm . B,,Task,But I think our our next step to look at is just that . B,,Task,So I don't think it's um we have something to do . B,,Task,"Uh we can't discuss it right now , "B,,Task,"because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . "A,,Minor,"Um well , "A,,Minor,for A,,Task,we do have to uh decide this this meeting . B,,Elicit,Yes ? A,,Task,Yeah . A,,Task,We need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um uh our target audience . B,,Minor,Mm-hmm . C,,Minor,Okay . B,,Minor,"'Kay , "C,,Task,Okay . B,,Task,but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . C,,Elicit,Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ? A,,Minor,"Um well , "A,,Minor,I do not want a full A,,Task,"uh it's not necessary to to have a full list , "A,,Task,"but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . "C,,Other,Okay . Okay . C,,Minor,Mm-hmm . B,,Task,The ten digits . A,,Minor,"Well , "A,,Task,"for example , that that's what we should think about . "A,,Minor,l A,,Elicit,"how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but "B,,Minor,"Oh , "B,,Task,"and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change "C,,Minor,Mm-hmm . C,,Task,Yes . A,,Minor,Yeah . A,,Elicit,A bit of a split mode . C,,Task,Change . A,,Minor,Uh l like Yeah . B,,Task,yeah . C,,Task,"Yes , yes . "A,,Elicit,Dual channel watch . C,,Task,Yes . B,,Task,Yeah . A,,Minor,"Okay , well um "A,,Other,m maybe I should write that down . C,,Minor,Well C,,Task,you're the secretary . A,,Elicit,"Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ? "D,,Task,Mielsen . A,,Other,"Mielsen , "A,,Minor,because I I was writing it down in the last uh A,,Other,Mielsen . A,,Minor,Right . Um A,,Other,I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . A,,Task,"So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um "C,,Task,"Mm okay , "B,,Other,Alright . C,,Task,"but make a s make a sub-folder for it , "C,,Task,because it's starting to fill up already . A,,Task,"Yeah , "A,,Minor,that's that's D,,Task,Yeah . A,,Task,"if you want to do it , Sebastian . "C,,Task,Sure . B,,Minor,Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh A,,Minor,"Okay , um Okay , so so um uh "C,,Minor,. A,,Task,Volume . A,,Task,Programme . A,,Task,Uh dual channel . Uh C,,Task,"Yes , that's important . "A,,Elicit,And and do we want um the ten digits ? B,,Elicit,The ten digits ? B,,Task,"Yeah , I believe so . "C,,Minor,"Well , "C,,Elicit,are are you sure ? D,,Minor,"Well , "D,,Task,if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . C,,Task,I'm not so sure . B,,Minor,Yeah . C,,Minor,"Well , "C,,Task,"that's complicated , "A,,Task,Yeah . C,,Elicit,but is that so relevant ? C,,Task,Because I don't think C,,Elicit,but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so . B,,Task,I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits . C,,Other,"Okay , "C,,Minor,I can imagine when B,,Minor,Uh and I think the most A,,Task,I agree actually . C,,Task,"I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . "B,,Task,"Just elder elder people would would buy it , "D,,Minor,Well B,,Minor,but C,,Task,"But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough . "A,,Task,But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . D,,Minor,But B,,Minor,Yep . D,,Minor,"Yeah , "B,,Task,The older people only use five of them . D,,Minor,and if if we C,,Minor,"Well , "C,,Elicit,but how how often do you watch all these channels ? D,,Task,"And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . "A,,Task,Often . D,,Minor,So C,,Task,"No , you're probably right . "B,,Task,Yeah . C,,Minor,Okay . C,,Task,But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . C,,Elicit,Don't you think ? A,,Minor,"Well , "A,,Task,"it depends on the on the on the looks , "C,,Task,The design . A,,Minor,on the on the B,,Task,On the design . C,,Other,Okay . C,,Minor,"Well , "C,,Minor,y C,,Task,then there should be should done be done something specific with it . D,,Minor,Well A,,Task,You c you can d make them very fancy D,,Minor,And A,,Minor,by um A,,Task,"I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones "C,,Minor,Mm-hmm . A,,Task,and it still looks very fancy . B,,Minor,Yeah . A,,Minor,So I'm I'm I do not agree C,,Other,"Okay , "C,,Elicit,"so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . "A,,Task,"Exactly , exactly . "C,,Other,Okay . D,,Task,And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . D,,Task,"Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , "D,,Task,but it would be a solution uh for A,,Minor,"Okay , "A,,Elicit,speech . C,,Minor,"Well , "C,,Task,maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . B,,Task,Yeah . C,,Minor,So um C,,Task,"when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . "A,,Minor,Yeah . C,,Task,And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . A,,Minor,To find A,,Task,yeah . C,,Task,"So maybe that's a possibility , "C,,Task,but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . D,,Task,Yeah . C,,Minor,But maybe when we uh A,,Task,Uh If if we would um drop the ten digits C,,Minor,Mm-hmm . A,,Task,"but keep the programme and the volume , "A,,Task,"because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um "C,,Minor,Okay . C,,Minor,"Okay , okay . "D,,Task,Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . D,,Minor,So then we should implement such a but A,,Minor,Yeah . A,,Task,But we do focus on younger people . A,,Minor,We d it C,,Minor,Okay . D,,Minor,Yes . A,,Task,it's a board uh decision . C,,Minor,Well . C,,Task,"I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . "B,,Minor,So B,,Elicit,we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . A,,Task,Okay . C,,Task,Yes . C,,Minor,"Well , "C,,Task,the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . C,,Task,It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function . B,,Other,Mm-hmm . C,,Task,"So that's that's a big advantage , I think . "A,,Task,Okay . A,,Task,"Okay , g good . "A,,Minor,Okay . C,,Task,There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . C,,Task,Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . C,,Task,So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . A,,Minor,Mm . C,,Elicit,But maybe can we we can think something smart about it . A,,Minor,Yep . C,,Task,There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . A,,Other,Okay . C,,Task,"So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . "A,,Elicit,But But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ? C,,Task,You have to do nothing for it . D,,Minor,M A,,Minor,Because it seems like a very B,,Task,Twelve dollar fifty . D,,Task,"And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem . "C,,Task,"Maybe , maybe not . "C,,Other,I'll have to find that out . C,,Task,Yes . C,,Minor,So C,,Task,"No , "C,,Task,that's very cheap . D,,Minor,'Cause when A,,Elicit,Is a cradle very cheap ? C,,Minor,It's C,,Minor,"Oh , "C,,Task,it's very cheap . C,,Task,That's no problem . C,,Task,It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts . A,,Task,"I know , "C,,Minor,It's A,,Task,b uh but there should be an adapter as well . C,,Task,"Yes , "C,,Task,but they're they're mass production . D,,Minor,Yeah . C,,Task,They're very cheap . C,,Task,So it will cost us p practically nothing . A,,Other,Okay . A,,Minor,Okay . A,,Task,We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um A,,Minor,I would like to hear um maybe A,,Task,"maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , "A,,Minor,"yeah , "A,,Task,but that are important . A,,Task,"Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . "A,,Elicit,Uh are there other things about the market we should know ? D,,Task,Um I think we dealt with the most important information . D,,Task,Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . D,,Task,So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people . D,,Task,"But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . "A,,Minor,Okay . D,,Task,So I don't think that's a big problem A,,Minor,Okay . C,,Minor,Yeah . A,,Minor,"Okay , so "A,,Elicit,"although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh Profitable . We we yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . "D,,Task,"Yes . Yeah , profitable . "C,,Task,Profitable . D,,Task,Yes . A,,Other,Okay . A,,Minor,O okay . Um A,,Elicit,Roo . B,,Task,"I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think . "A,,Other,Nothing to add . A,,Elicit,Sebastian ? C,,Other,Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um A,,Task,Yeah ? Great . C,,Minor,so uh basically C,,Task,we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . C,,Minor,So C,,Task,"on the outside it looks easy , "C,,Task,but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . C,,Minor,So that's one the C,,Task,those are the choices we have to make . C,,Task,"But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that these kinds of things . "A,,Minor,Mm-hmm . A,,Minor,Yeah . C,,Task,"Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . "C,,Task,"Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , "C,,Task,"and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , "C,,Task,which uh I think our customers will like . C,,Task,"The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . "A,,Minor,Yep . C,,Task,Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . C,,Task,"If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . "C,,Minor,So that's another A,,Minor,"Yeah , "A,,Task,"and that was the main issue , "A,,Elicit,right ? A,,Minor,The the board C,,Minor,"well , "C,,Minor,it wa it w C,,Task,"it was an issue , "C,,Minor,but we also thought that C,,Task,we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . A,,Minor,Yeah . C,,Task,And this even uh makes it more cheapy . B,,Elicit,But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? C,,Minor,Mm-hmm . A,,Task,The board . B,,Task,The circuit board . C,,Task,The circuit board . B,,Task,The fewer buttons you can use on it . C,,Task,"The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . "A,,Task,"No , "A,,Minor,it's th A,,Task,yeah . B,,Other,"Yeah , okay . "A,,Task,"It's the other way around , "A,,Task,yeah . B,,Other,Yeah . C,,Task,"And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . "C,,Task,So that's that's another advantage . A,,Task,It shouldn't be a big issue . B,,Minor,Well B,,Minor,it B,,Task,then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition . C,,Minor,So C,,Task,"Yes , "C,,Task,because I don't know C,,Task,Yes . C,,Minor,I d C,,Task,I really don't know . C,,Minor,So B,,Minor,No . C,,Task,It can be costly . A,,Minor,Okay . C,,Task,Maybe not . A,,Task,"I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , "A,,Other,I will have a look at it . A,,Task,Maybe you will get some information on that . C,,Minor,Yes . A,,Minor,Um I'm not sure how how that C,,Minor,"Yes , "C,,Minor,I al I C,,Other,I hope my personal coach will uh have a lo uh look at it . A,,Minor,Yep . A,,Other,"Okay , great . "A,,Minor,"Um well , "A,,Task,I think we're qui quite done . B,,Task,"We're done , I think . "A,,Task,Um for now we will have the lunch break . C,,Task,How nice . A,,Task,"Um I'm don't know how long the break will be , "A,,Task,but we'll find out . B,,Task,Me neither . A,,Task,"Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , "A,,Task,uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . A,,Other,Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . A,,Task,"If you want to look at it um well , just do . "A,,Task,"Um the Interface Designer , um I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept . "B,,Task,Interface industrial . A,,Other,"Uh I'm sorry , "A,,Task,"yeah , "B,,Minor,Yeah . A,,Other,I'm sorry . A,,Task,"User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . "C,,Minor,"Well , "C,,Other,we understand . A,,Minor,And um B,,Task,Uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition . C,,Minor,Well A,,Minor,"Well , "A,,Task,"i it should be easy , "B,,Minor,Well A,,Task,that's w w what we concluded . A,,Task,"It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um um yeah , some some fancy lights . "C,,Minor,Mm yes . B,,Task,Yeah . A,,Task,I think that's what we decided . C,,Elicit,So we drop the voice recognition ? A,,Task,"No no no , we didn't "C,,Minor,Or C,,Other,Oh . A,,Task,but it shouldn't be integrated A,,Minor,"yeah , "A,,Task,"it's of course it's user interface , "A,,Task,but um i I was talking about really the design of the C,,Other,Okay . C,,Minor,Well um C,,Elicit,do we really have to decide now C,,Elicit,or can we decide next meeting ? A,,Task,No . A,,Task,We can decide the next meeting . Yep . C,,Other,Okay . C,,Task,Because I'll have some updated info on that uh A,,Minor,Yeah . A,,Task,I guess all of you have i updated info . A,,Task,I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching . B,,Minor,Yep . A,,Task,"And I'm sure the market will um uh uh will change , adapt "D,,Minor,Hmm . B,,Task,Adapt . C,,Task,Adapt . D,,Minor,Left . D,,Minor,Hmm . A,,Minor,and um so A,,Task,we will see that . A,,Minor,"Um yeah , "A,,Task,that's it for now . B,,Task,That's it . B,,Task,'Kay . A,,Elicit,Any other questions A,,Elicit,or can we have the lunch ? C,,Task,We can have the lunch . D,,Task,Yeah . A,,Task,"Yeah , okay . "B,,Task,I'll take the lunch . A,,Task,Good .
