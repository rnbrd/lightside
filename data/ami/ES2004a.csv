A,Minor,"Hmm hmm hmm . "
B,Minor,"Are we "
B,Elicit,"we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay comm that's fine . "
B,Elicit,"Am I supposed to be standing up there ? "
D,Elicit,"So we've got both of these clipped on ? "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"She gonna answer me or not ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm I've got "
D,Task,"Right comm both of them comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Other,"God . "
D,Other,"Jesus comm it's gonna fall off . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Yep comm yep . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Tu tu tu tu "
B,Other,"Hello everybody . "
A,Other,"Hi comm good morning . "
B,Task,"Um I'm Sarah comm "
B,Task,"the Project Manager "
B,Task,"and this is our first meeting comm surprisingly enough . "
B,Task,"Okay comm this is our agenda comm um "
B,Task,"we will do some stuff comm "
B,Task,"get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . "
B,Task,"Um then we'll go do tool training comm "
B,Task,"talk about the project plan comm "
B,Task,"discuss our own ideas and everything um "
B,Task,"and we've got twenty five minutes to do that comm "
B,Other,"as far as I can understand . "
B,Task,"Now comm we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . "
B,Task,"Um comm we want it to be original comm "
B,Task,"something that's uh people haven't thought of comm "
B,Task,"that's not out in the shops comm "
B,Task,"um comm trendy comm "
B,Task,"appealing to a wide market comm "
B,Task,"but you know comm not a hunk of metal comm "
B,Task,"and user-friendly comm "
B,Task,"grannies to kids comm maybe even pooches should be able to use it . "
B,Task,"Okay comm um comm first is the functional design comm "
B,Task,"um this is where we all go off and do our individual work comm "
B,Task,"um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product comm "
B,Task,"um what effects the product has to have "
B,Task,"and how it's actually going to do that . "
B,Task,"Um comm conceptual design comm "
B,Task,"what we're thinking comm "
B,Task,"how it's gonna go "
B,Task,"and then the detailed design comm "
B,Task,"how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm right . "
B,Task,"We're gonna practice with the pens "
B,Task,"and draw our favourite animal on the white board comm "
B,Other,"I'll go first comm "
B,Task,"and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Oops . "
B,Other,"Okay comm I'll leave space for everyone else . Um "
B,Other,"What's missing ? "
B,Task,"We're running out of blue . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I'm not gonna ask you to guess comm "
B,Task,"I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"And I see them as majestic comm and independent comm and proud . "
A,Other,"Oh sorry . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Now comm who would like to go next ? "
A,Other,"Yeah comm me . "
B,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"Cat . "
A,Elicit,"Where did this come from ? "
B,Elicit,"Is that your lapel then ? "
A,Task,"Uh comm yep . "
B,Other,"There you go . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ? "
D,Task,"A kind of dog ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"It's actually sitting comm so "
D,Other,"Sorry ? "
C,Task,"It's sitting down . "
A,Task,"it's sitting comm it's not standing . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"Okay comm I see it as one thing it's very supportive . "
A,Task,"It's your best friend "
A,Task,"and your you can talk to a dog comm "
A,Task,"it can be your best friend comm "
A,Task,"it doesn't discriminate between you comm based on what you are . "
A,Task,"Second it's loyal "
A,Task,"and third thing it's got intuition . "
A,Task,"dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog . "
B,Other,"Okay comm thank you . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Other,"Yeah I'll have a go . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Sorry . "
D,Other,"Please comm please leave me a space at the bottom comm "
C,Other,"Thanks . "
D,Other,"I'm little comm "
C,Task,"Alright comm okay . "
D,Task,"you can get to the top comm with standing on a chair . "
C,Task,"Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do comm I'll have to have to go for something a bit random . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Does it look like a dog actually ? "
C,Task,"And also comm my drawing skill isn't that great so comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Well comm as you can see comm the quality of the work today is um "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I think it's outstandingly good . "
C,Task,"Okay comm now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be "
C,Task,"because that looks like a beak now comm so . "
D,Task,"Crocodile ? "
B,Task,"Gonna be a bird . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it can be a crocodile comm it can be a crocodile . "
B,Minor,"Is it gonna be "
C,Minor,"Well it was it was an at first "
B,Task,"it's gonna be a bird . "
C,Task,"firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex "
C,Task,"and then it sort of changed into a pelican "
D,Minor,"O "
C,Task,"but it can be a crocodile now actually . "
B,Task,"That's lovely . "
C,Task,"Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is . Um "
D,Minor,"Beauti that's "
C,Task,"uh scary comm "
C,Task,"uh strong comm "
C,Task,"yeah that's about it I think . "
B,Task,"Okay it's fine . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Um comm I'm very impressed with your artistic skills comm "
C,Minor,"Uh uh "
D,Task,"mine's are dreadful . "
D,Task,"Oops this is now coming apart comm "
D,Other,"let me just put the top in . "
C,Minor,"Wo "
D,Other,"I hope that clicks in comm "
D,Other,"I'll just I'll hold it on comm okay . "
D,Other,"Oops comm oh dear comm "
D,Elicit,"what happened there ? "
B,Other,"Technical help . "
D,Task,"Hopefully that'll stay on comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"two-handed version . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm uh "
D,Task,"Again this is off the top of my head comm "
D,Task,"I was gonna do a big cat too comm um . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
D,Other,"Oh dear comm "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"it doesn't look what like what I want it to be . "
C,Minor,"S "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"It's not a vampire bat honestly . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh and somewhere there's a body behind . "
C,Task,"Okay comm some sort of bird "
D,Minor,"That's my dreadful "
D,Task,"that's the worst yet comm "
D,Minor,"that's "
D,Task,"it's meant to be an eagle "
B,Minor,"A seagu "
C,Task,"Ah eagle comm right okay . "
A,Task,"Eagle comm okay . "
B,Task,"right comm "
B,Task,"not a seagull . "
D,Task,"you can tell it's a flying animal "
D,Task,"could have been a seagull comm "
D,Task,"I never thought of a seagull . "
D,Task,"An eagle comm um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness . "
D,Task,"I suppose they're all so independent comm "
D,Other,"I'd put that one down again . "
D,Other,"Da dum um . "
C,Task,"They're good at golf . "
D,Other,"Indepen independent comm right comm "
D,Elicit,"did you say they're good at golf ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"Are they ? "
C,Task,"no yeah comm "
B,Task,"Eagle . "
D,Other,"Oh . Oh right comm okay comm "
C,Task,"an eagle . "
D,Task,"I'm not good at golf . "
D,Task,"I'd say they're quite free-spirited comm flying around everywhere comm doing their own thing . "
D,Task,"And uh comm birds of prey aren't they comm "
D,Other,"oh dear comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"intrepid . I'll put that comm intrepid . "
D,Task,"There we go comm "
B,Task,"That's lovely . "
D,Task,"hope that pen's gonna be okay . "
D,Other,"Whoops . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"That was fun comm "
B,Minor,"right . "
B,Task,"Um finance-wise comm we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros comm "
B,Task,"which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds comm at all . "
B,Elicit,"Any ideas ? "
C,Minor,"It's about "
D,Task,"Seventeen . "
C,Minor,"mm comm mm yeah . "
A,Task,"One point four or something like that . "
A,Task,"One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm something like that comm "
C,Minor,"so that "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"D fifteen ? "
C,Task,"yeah about seventeen comm seventeen Pounds comm something like that . "
D,Task,"Seventeen Pounds . "
B,Task,"Seventeen . "
B,Task,"Okay comm that's expensive . "
D,Elicit,"Should we be making notes of this ? "
D,Elicit,"We can just refer to this later can't we ? "
C,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"I think so comm I think so comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Other,"I'll be able to um pull it up comm "
B,Other,"or I could put it in the shared folder or something . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Havi having said that though comm if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . "
C,Minor,"So comm it'd still be "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Elicit,"Really ? "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"we had to buy one . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price comm "
B,Minor,"I think "
D,Minor,"we d or "
D,Task,"or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"um production cost's at twelve fifty comm so "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"pretty huge margin . "
B,Task,"half of the selling price is taken up by building it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um comm and profit aim is fifty million Euros comm "
B,Minor,"which is uh "
D,Elicit,"In our first year ? "
B,Task,"Yi yes comm "
B,Task,"um yeah comm I presume so . Um "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So then "
D,Task,"You've got market range international "
D,Task,"and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"just t we're not focusing on business market comm any particular thing comm it's everyone "
B,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"user-friendly to everyone . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Big target group . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"yes comm yes comm "
B,Minor,"I don't think we have to "
B,Task,"I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that comm "
D,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"um making that a key point comm "
B,Task,"just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia comm America comm things like that . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"What are your experiences with remote controls ? "
B,Task,"I mean I've got we got um we had three videos comm a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so we got one of the universal remote controls comm um that you programme each of your things into comm "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"that c "
B,Task,"but that kept losing the signals "
B,Task,"so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . "
B,Task,"I think it was quite a cheapie as well comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"so that might have had something to do with it comm "
C,Minor,"uh . "
B,Task,"but that was quite good comm the fact that you could You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . "
C,Task,"Use all the ones at the same time . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"you wanna integrate everything into one like "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"'cause you "
D,Task,"My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy comm "
D,Task,"not doing any tampering with it and programming comm "
D,Task,"using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . "
D,Task,"But basically on comm off comm volume up and down comm channel one comm two comm th that basic functions comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I don't think I could go any further with it than that comm "
D,Task,"so comm I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"the main that's the main stuff anyway comm I mean "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"and you don't want to "
B,Task,"I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And symbols that you don't necessarily understand comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"symbols you're meant to understand that you don't . "
A,Task,"So simplification of symbols you could think of . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Minor,"When they're "
B,Task,"when you've got the main things on the front of it "
B,Task,"and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording comm things like that inside it . "
D,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"'Cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"it's obvious what you're doing comm um . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Actually that just raises a point comm "
D,Elicit,"I wonder what our design people think comm "
D,Task,"but you know on a mobile phone comm you can press a key and it gives you a menu comm it's got a menu display comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Menu comm alright . "
D,Task,"I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . "
A,Minor,"Uh uh "
A,Task,"Right comm "
A,Task,"I was thinking on the same lines you comm "
A,Task,"instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user comm may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that comm "
A,Task,"like a mobile comm yeah and with menus . "
D,Task,"With menus comm yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone comm people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"What about the older generation ? "
B,Elicit,"What about granny and grandads ? "
B,Task,"Um comm my grandad can answer his mobile phone comm "
A,Other,"You mean to save it lesser number . "
B,Task,"but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ? "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"I don't think they tape things comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext comm so "
B,Minor,"I don't think they use "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps comm "
B,Task,"Mm comm yeah comm the age gap . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing comm "
C,Task,"'cause I mean comm menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I don't know comm "
C,Minor,"But I don't know how "
B,Minor,"I d "
B,Task,"I don't like the comm you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system . "
C,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I find it really confusing comm "
B,Task,"I kept getting lost in the phone comm "
B,Task,"I di I've not got a new one "
B,Task,"but uh my friend got a new one "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost comm "
B,Task,"but that's just me . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I don't I don't know how for twenty fi comm or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway comm I'd assume . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Obviously it displays less on the screen comm "
B,Task,"Teletext has got that option as well . "
D,Task,"it displays less on the screen "
D,Task,"but as long as they can read it that's the main thing . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or what about kind of a dual function ? "
B,Task,"In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play comm volume comm programme things "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures comm obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"The other thing is comm just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again comm it could have a flip top remote control "
D,Task,"so that when you flip over the top comm your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm comm okay . "
B,Task,"I think that's a cost thing comm "
A,Minor,"S "
C,Minor,"Y "
B,Task,"I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about "
A,Minor,"It might "
D,Task,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"it might save a b bit of space comm "
A,Task,"it's i instead of looking bulky comm it might look small . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yes comm no that's important . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm like smaller . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But it might have its cost implications . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone comm "
D,Task,"it can still be lightweight plastic comm you know ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Something that's easily moulded and produced . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . "
C,Task,"No uh uh "
B,Minor,"Um comm right comm okay "
B,Task,"we've got half an hour before the next meeting comm "
B,Task,"so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um "
B,Task,"I think that's probably about it "
B,Task,"and then we'll come back and liaise again "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation . "
C,Other,"Just just a quick thing about the um "
B,Task,"Sure . "
C,Other,"about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable ? "
C,Minor,"The sort of "
C,Task,"I I had a quick look at the company website "
C,Task,"and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics comm "
D,Other,"Ah right . "
C,Task,"so I think think the whole design thing might be qui "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Sure b "
C,Task,"I mean you don't you you can still have plastic "
D,Minor,"y yeah . "
C,Task,"and it'd look quite good but "
D,Task,"But yeah comm I mean it doesn't have to be that comm you know "
D,Task,"th that was my main point comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"we don't have to use metal comm "
D,Task,"I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I presume it would . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"I would "
B,Task,"it would probably . "
B,Task,"I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . "
B,Task,"They're kind of moulded "
B,Task,"and look a bit different comm "
B,Task,"and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic comm "
B,Task,"which looks a bit smarter comm "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so let's break it up there . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Elicit,"Okay ? "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"So comm see you in half an hour . "
D,Elicit,"Do we go back to our room ? Yep ? "
B,Task,"I think so comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm comm yeah . "
