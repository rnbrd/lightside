D,Task,"I wanna find our if our remote works . "
A,Task,"Me too . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Okay . Um here's the agenda for our last meeting . "
D,Other,"Whoohoo . "
A,Task,"Um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation comm "
A,Task,"then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . "
A,Task,"Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process comm "
A,Task,"and then we're gonna close it up comm "
A,Task,"and we have forty minutes comm "
A,Task,"so "
A,Task,"let's get started . "
A,Other,"Oh comm no comm "
A,Task,"let's have the prototype presentation . "
B,Task,"Mm 'kay comm "
B,Elicit,"you ready ? "
C,Task,"Um sure . "
C,Elicit,"You or me ? "
B,Task,"Y you read that stuff comm since you wrote it . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Well comm since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for comm I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . "
B,Other,"I'll be the Vanna . "
C,Task,"The base is gonna be gunmetal gray comm which is what we had decided comm "
C,Task,"and it's gonna be plastic . "
C,Task,"Um then there's the latex cover comm which is what you see as red . "
C,Task,"Um because it can be replaceable comm we just kinda went with the colour . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . "
C,Task,"Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue comm almost see-through . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow . "
D,Task,"That's nice . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"The whole thing lights up if you press any button comm rather than it just that one button will light up . "
D,Minor,"Good . "
C,Task,"Um and then at the bottom we have our logo . "
C,Task,"Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ which will actually look like our logo . "
A,Minor,"Great . "
C,Task,"And then on the side you have the buttons . "
C,Task,"They're one button comm but they kind of push up and down . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I don't think they're scrolling . "
B,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"They're just buttons . "
C,Task,"Right comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"And then "
C,Task,"yeah comm the buttons . "
B,Task,"On off switch will be here "
B,Task,"and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of comm "
B,Task,"by concave sort of thing comm "
B,Task,"except for comm you know comm can't see underneath . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that comm "
B,Task,"because they're very "
B,Task,"nice to stock you know comm stick your finger in . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used comm menu comm mute comm "
C,Task,"Thumb-shaped . "
B,Task,"and then these are the numbers comm "
B,Task,"so our channel and our volume will be on either side . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top comm "
C,Task,"just which we didn't do . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand comm is it gonna be a single or a double ? "
B,Task,"I'd say a single . "
A,Other,"Single . "
C,Task,"Single . "
A,Task,"Single sounds good comm "
A,Task,"'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"it's only actually the size of my hand . "
A,Task,"Great . Great . "
A,Task,"I think you did an awesome job . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think it's a beautiful "
A,Task,"It is beautiful comm and it's everything that we discussed . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Good job comm you guys . "
A,Task,"Good job . "
C,Other,"Oh thank you . "
B,Other,"Whoohoo . "
D,Task,"Those are really good . "
A,Minor,"Alright "
A,Other,"what's next in our agenda ? "
A,Task,"Um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria comm "
A,Task,"and that's with Courtney . "
D,Task,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"it's a PowerPoint presentation . "
D,Task,"I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about . "
D,Task,"It's under evaluation . "
A,Other,"Right . "
D,Other,"Alright . "
D,Task,"Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask comm "
D,Task,"is it easy to use comm is it fashionable uh "
D,Task,"yeah comm I guess we should write these down so we can reference them . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"Feel good meaning what ? "
D,Task,"Like does it feel good comm like "
C,Elicit,"Physically comm "
D,Task,"yeah comm physically . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"okay . "
A,Minor,"Sqi "
D,Task,"That's just for current trend . "
A,Task,"Right . "
D,Task,"It doesn't really count comm you guys . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"But it's "
D,Elicit,"so we do have removable covers comm right ? "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm well then that's covered . "
D,Minor,"And so we n k "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Elicit,"everybody have that ? "
A,Other,"I'll wait . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm she's got it . "
D,Task,"It's good . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay so comm we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale comm "
D,Task,"and so we need to discuss how we feel . It falls within this range comm "
D,Task,"so for easy to use comm "
D,Elicit,"do we feel it's very easy to use ? "
A,Minor,"Are we going to indi "
C,Elicit,"True or false comm easy to use . "
A,Task,"I say we individually rate "
A,Elicit,"what do you say ? "
D,Minor,"You guys "
A,Task,"Just orally . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Why not ? "
A,Minor,"We have "
A,Task,"okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um easy to use . I vote six . "
D,Task,"Oh wait comm that's false . "
A,Task,"Oh comm "
A,Task,"two . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I'd say two as well . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm two . "
D,Task,"Two . That's what I say . "
A,Other,"Uh hello comm we're great . "
D,Elicit,"Okay comm fashionable ? "
A,Task,"Um one . "
B,Task,"At the moment comm no . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"I mean like no comm I think it's very fashionable . "
A,Task,"Me too comm very chic . "
D,Task,"I thi I would give it a one . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"One comm I give it a one . "
B,Task,"I'll give it a two comm because at the moment it's not looking that way . "
D,Task,"Well comm that's that's just like that's a clay comm it's a prototype . "
A,Task,"Oh comm and ma it's a prototype comm "
A,Task,"right . "
D,Elicit,"What do you think ? "
C,Task,"Mm I don't think it's that fashionable . "
C,Task,"I'd give it like three or four . "
A,Minor,"Well comm now I'm . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So comm the average is about a two . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it's a two . "
C,Task,"But then I'm not fashionable comm so "
A,Task,"Two or three . "
C,Task,"don't use my opinion . "
A,Task,"Two point five . "
D,Task,"That's okay . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Neither are all o all the customers we have comm either . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Elicit,"does it feel good ? "
A,Task,"Imagine comm "
A,Task,"since we obviously don't have that . "
D,Minor,"I feel like "
C,Other,"Does it feel good ? "
B,Task,"Uh the shape of it actually does uh . "
A,Task,"And it's i it is very ergonomically designed . "
A,Task,"It's gonna be curved . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's gonna be thicker . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Depth . "
D,Task,"I think it feels good . "
A,Task,"I think so too . "
D,Task,"I'll give it a two . "
A,Task,"'Kay . Two . "
C,Task,"I'll give it a one . "
D,Elicit,"What do you say ? "
B,Task,"I'd say a two . "
A,Task,"Alright comm average is two . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Is it technologically innovative ? "
A,Other,"Oh sorry I'm taking over your job here . "
D,Task,"Oh no comm it's fine comm "
D,Other,"you're I mean you're Project Manager . "
A,Task,"Go right ahead . "
D,Minor,"Um yeah comm I mean and it "
D,Elicit,"does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it ? "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"Right ? "
A,Elicit,"We were able to do it with that kind of chip . "
C,Other,"Oh right comm "
C,Minor,"the "
B,Task,"We could do it with the chip comm yes . "
B,Minor,"It wasn't "
B,Task,"we have no reflection of it on the prototype comm "
D,Task,"And there's no way you can represent it on here . Y "
A,Task,"Yeah comm right . "
B,Task,"but that's because it's only two dimensions comm really . "
A,Minor,"That was "
A,Minor,"'kay . "
A,Task,"And we discussed that being included . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm so . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Then yes comm "
D,Minor,"then I would "
D,Minor,"well it isn't "
D,Elicit,"what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? "
B,Minor,"It "
A,Task,"Well we don' have the you know comm we can't say channel comm and it changes the channel comm channel eight . "
D,Task,"And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ comm "
D,Task,"so I'd probably give it a three . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Even though it is for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced . "
D,Task,"But it is just a T_V_ remote . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I'd go for a three or four on that one comm so "
C,Task,"Yeah I go four . "
A,Task,"okay comm "
A,Task,"let's go for a three point five . "
B,Other,"Three and an half . "
A,Elicit,"Alright comm and the last criteria is it is it um "
C,Elicit,"Squishy and fruity . "
A,Minor,"Well comm we've covered that with the "
D,Task,"Well yeah comm so I'd give it a two . "
C,Task,"It's just trendy comm basically . "
A,Task,"trendy . "
B,Task,"It's capable of being squishy and fruity . "
A,Task,"Sure . Capable . Very capable . "
D,Task,"Oh comm it's very capable of being squishy and fruity . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And it's very important . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"'Kay comm there we go . "
D,Task,"Okay comm next . "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Task,"Next . "
D,Task,"So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner comm "
D,Other,"and uh hopefully we'll sell millions . "
D,Task,"Good job comm team . "
B,Elicit,"How did you get that in there ? "
D,Other,"What ? "
B,Task,"The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . "
D,Task,"It it does . "
A,Task,"It does . "
B,Task,"That was good . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
A,Task,"Very good . "
A,Task,"Alright comm let's go back to this "
A,Task,"No comm that's it . Hmm . "
A,Other,"Oops . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so now uh we're moving on to finance comm "
A,Task,"okay . "
A,Task,"I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet "
A,Task,"and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro . "
A,Task,"If so comm we can proceed comm "
A,Task,"if not comm we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit . "
A,Other,"'Kay ? So let me bring that up . "
A,Other,"Here we go . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Um it's not hand dynamo comm it's powered by battery comm so we give it a "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Two . "
A,Task,"Number of components you plan to use . "
A,Elicit,"Do I just put quantity being one battery comm or "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
A,Minor,"But if it's a "
A,Minor,"do you wanna go for "
A,Task,"this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s comm "
A,Task,"'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . "
A,Task,"Oh comm let's just go for a lithium . "
A,Elicit,"What do you say ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm let's let's do a lithium . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I think uh "
B,Minor,"it's . "
A,Task,"I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically "
D,Minor,"We're gon that's gon "
D,Task,"Nologically advanced comm "
A,Task,"right . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm down to the electronics um section . "
A,Elicit,"We're gonna need this kind comm correct comm if we do the voice sensor comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"so one of those . "
A,Task,"It is a single-curved comm so one of those . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Elicit,"What's that ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's correct . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Kay comm down here comm case material . "
C,Task,"It's plastic . "
D,Minor,"We "
D,Task,"plastic . "
A,Task,"Plastic . "
D,Task,"And special colour . "
C,Task,"And special colour . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Down here comm interface type . "
A,Task,"We're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel . "
C,Task,"No comm we don't have the scroll . "
A,Minor,"Isn't "
A,Task,"oh those are just regular buttons . "
D,Minor,"But it's "
B,Task,"Well comm that's the push-button too comm right there . "
C,Task,"Buttons . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"but i so i "
A,Elicit,"This ? "
B,Task,"Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . "
B,Task,"We're really having just push-button interface . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"so we can just go um . "
D,Task,"But will we w actually we'll need two comm "
D,Elicit,"won't we ? "
D,Task,"One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side . "
B,Task,"But it that just covers the type of button we're having . "
B,Task,"Because we're not doing a scroll on the side comm it's still push-button . "
C,Task,"Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and "
B,Task,"Push-button . "
C,Other,"push-buttons . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Right I think she's "
B,Task,"But we just have push "
C,Task,"But we don't have any scrolls . "
A,Task,"I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ? "
D,Task,"Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . "
D,Task,"There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ? "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I don't know comm "
A,Minor,"they might put us "
A,Minor,"well comm let's just . "
C,Task,"Two interfaces comm "
C,Elicit,"is that what w should we s say ? "
B,Minor,"Let's call it th "
A,Elicit,"Two or would it be three ? "
D,Task,"Or three comm "
D,Task,"because of one on each side and one on top . "
C,Task,"Okay comm fine . Yeah . "
D,Task,"I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine . "
D,Task,"Well less than twenty nine even . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay "
A,Minor,"and we're gonna "
A,Task,"button supplements the buttons are no "
D,Task,"They're a special colour . "
A,Task,"uh okay . "
D,Task,"Um they're uh they're a special form comm 'cause they're indented . "
A,Task,"Are they ? "
A,Task,"Oh comm right . "
C,Minor,"And then s "
D,Task,"And comm they're a special material . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm . Well comm we're under cost then . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
C,Elicit,"We're over ? "
A,Task,"No comm we're under . "
B,Task,"Grand . "
D,Task,"We're under . "
A,Task,"Twelve point five is our limit . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Oh comm I see . "
A,Task,"We've got eleven point two . "
B,Task,"So we can go to production . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"We can go to "
A,Task,"I dunno what I just did . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Now we're gonna talk about the project process "
A,Task,"um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result . "
A,Task,"Um did we have a lot of room for creativity ? "
A,Task,"Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership comm "
A,Task,"um teamwork comm "
A,Task,"and the means comm meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there comm "
A,Task,"and if we found any new ideas . "
A,Elicit,"Now comm question is comm how do we do this ? "
B,Task,"Go back . "
D,Task,"I think we just discuss it . "
A,Task,"Discuss comm sure . "
B,Task,"Previous . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Elicit,"Who want who would like to go first ? "
B,Task,"We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself comm in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote comm initially . "
C,Task,"We didn't have a whiteboard . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Oh that's true . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"And no internet . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"No comm yeah comm that's a good point . "
D,Task,"'Cause I'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? "
D,Task,"Oh comm overall I mean I thought we did a good job like "
D,Minor,"We got to choose basically we had control over "
D,Task,"minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . "
A,Task,"Right comm "
A,Task,"and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be "
A,Task,"and also how fashionable comm which I kind of like "
D,Task,"And we're a fashion forward technology company . "
A,Minor,"we "
A,Task,"yep . "
A,Task,"You know it . "
B,Minor,"right . "
A,Elicit,"Um what about um the teamwork aspect ? "
A,Elicit,"How did you guys enjoy making the model comm the prototype ? "
C,Task,"I think we did well . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think ya' did . "
A,Elicit,"Did you work well together in there comm and "
C,Task,"Yep . "
B,Other,"Well comm no comm there was there was scratching and fighting comm but no . "
A,Task,"'kay . "
D,Other,"Minus that one fight . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Oh my God comm "
C,Other,"Gouges . "
A,Task,"and we've all been a pretty congenial team here comm I think . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We hadn't had any ma fallings out . "
D,Other,"I mean minus you guys being wha what is it comm the survey comm annoying or what is it ? "
B,Other,"Irritating . "
A,Other,"Irritating . "
D,Other,"Irritating comm yeah . "
C,Other,"Irritating . "
D,Task,"Wow that's a it's definitely a strong one . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"The means comm the whiteboard didn't work . "
C,Task,"And no internet . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"I have to knock that one down a couple notches . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm and no internet . "
B,Other,"A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet . "
C,Other,"Misses . I do . "
D,Task,"And the digital the digital pens "
C,Other,"There's so much available . "
C,Other,"Like it's information "
A,Task,"Yeah comm digital pens . "
D,Minor,"were "
D,Task,"they were pretty cool . "
B,Task,"I really appreciated those comm yeah . "
A,Task,"They were fine . "
D,Task,"Yeah they were fun comm even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them comm "
D,Task,"but they are awesome . "
B,Task,"The use of the laptops for receiving everything . "
B,Task,"It was wireless too comm so . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Right comm laptops are extremely handy comm "
A,Task,"wireless . "
D,Task,"And these things whoa . "
A,Task,"And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And Big Brother . "
A,Task,"Big brother . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"'Kay comm have we found any new ideas through this process ? "
D,Other,"Um we are really gonna sell this . "
D,Other,"Ta-da . "
A,Task,"For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And that's your right brain taking over comm w wanting the artistic comm the fashionable comm the hip comm you know . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"If we all just went out and bought useful things comm I don't think I mean that's not what technology . "
C,Task,"Well comm that's why I don't like uh Macs or Apples comm "
C,Task,"just 'cause I look at it comm and I know it's probably a very good computer comm "
C,Task,"but I look at it comm and I'm taken back to elementary school comm 'cause they look the same . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"They look like they did when I was in elementary school comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm 'cause they're pretty "
C,Task,"and that's so old-fashioned to me . "
D,Minor,"and just like "
B,Task,"The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Exactly comm "
C,Task,"so I associate them with like really low-tech comm really cheap comm bad "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Just the Mac font bothers me even . "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But I do like iPods comm "
A,Other,"go figure . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm no comm iPods "
D,Task,"They want all those words for presentation comm even the plugs . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well comm i iPods are now quite trendy comm "
B,Task,"and they come in different colours . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Colours . "
A,Task,"Exactly . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone comm back when we were like in high school comm just so they could get the changeable face plates . "
D,Task,"Oh yeah comm everybody . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Anyway comm so that is definitely at work . "
B,Task,"Not me . "
D,Task,"Mine is amber . "
C,Minor,"But the my "
B,Task,"I didn't have a phone 'til university . "
C,Task,"but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs . "
D,Task,"Look at it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That is a piece of work . "
A,Task,"Fashionable chic people will . "
C,Task,"You're kidding . "
D,Task,"Wow . "
C,Task,"No comm no . "
D,Task,"Marketing Director says yeah . "
D,Task,"Fashionable people will buy it . "
C,Task,"No comm marketing has to actually create the desire for it . "
D,Other,"Oh comm I will create desire . "
B,Task,"That's okay . "
B,Other,"We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met . "
B,Other,"This will help them find the one . "
C,Other,"Ri They'll be sexy with it . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Other,"We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial comm and that's the fig-leaf . "
B,Other,"That's right . "
C,Minor,"Oh right . "
D,Other,"Mm . That'll sell . "
A,Other,"There you go comm marketing . "
C,Other,"Let you loose . "
B,Other,"And so the serpent says comm use our remote . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm no . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we're gonna wrap this up now . "
A,Task,"Um the costs are within the budget comm "
A,Task,"we evaluated the project comm "
A,Task,"and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary comm "
A,Task,"and then we're going to have a big giant party comm apparently comm according to this comm so . "
B,Other,"Whoohoo . Margaritas for everyone . "
A,Other,"Alright comm thank you team comm "
A,Task,"you did a great job comm "
A,Task,"it was lovely working with you . "
C,Task,"Good . "
D,Task,"You too . "
B,Other,"Yay . "
B,Other,"Thanks to the Project Leader . "
B,Minor,"Now we know w "
