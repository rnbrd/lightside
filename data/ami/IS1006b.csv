A,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting . "
D,Task,"Of course . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Task,"I will take the minutes "
A,Task,"you mm you three are going to do presentation . "
A,Task,"Um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Elicit,"we need uh to know the the user uh needs "
A,Task,"that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part "
A,Elicit,"we want to know how it going to work "
A,Minor,"and um "
A,Task,"third part uh I don't remember "
A,Other,"which is not very good . "
A,Other,"Ah of course comm "
A,Elicit,"how to to design this uh this "
D,Elicit,"Nice stuff "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"let's go for the three presentations comm "
A,Task,"so first um Marketing Expert . "
D,Elicit,"Who starts ? "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"Ha . "
D,Task,"okay . "
A,Task,"So wait a minute . Mm . "
D,Other,"So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"it's being modified . "
D,Other,"Do you want yeah comm open . Read only . "
D,Task,"I hope I saved it . "
D,Minor,"So comm um "
B,Task,"Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh . "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"this is my name . "
A,Minor,"Sounds uh "
B,Other,"We met before . "
D,Task,"So as you know comm you I think you already know me comm Sammy Benjo . "
D,Task,"I am the expert in marketing "
D,Other,"and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls comm "
D,Other,"and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"next please . "
D,Other,"Uh-oh . "
A,Other,"Mm uh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it is put F_ five . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"The full page presentation comm "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"maybe in the full page "
C,Task,"yep . "
D,Task,"because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation comm so . "
B,Task,"F_ F_ five . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yep . "
A,Other,"F_ five . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh-huh hmm okay . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . Mm . "
D,Minor,"So basically uh "
D,Task,"what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control comm let's ask people who are users of remote controls "
D,Elicit,"how they feel about w the current remote controls comm "
D,Elicit,"what they like comm "
D,Elicit,"what they don't like "
D,Minor,"and um "
D,Elicit,"and what they do with them by the way "
D,Task,"because they are supposed to be useful . "
D,Task,"Don't forget about that . "
D,Task,"So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls "
D,Other,"and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . "
D,Task,"And next please . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm so basically "
D,Task,"what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . "
D,Task,"First of all comm they find it very ugly . "
D,Task,"Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one "
D,Task,"uh they're not nice colour comm not nice shape comm "
D,Task,"I mean they're all the same comm "
D,Task,"and they're not l good looking . "
D,Task,"Um what is interesting "
D,Task,"is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control comm "
D,Task,"so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um . "
D,Task,"And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use "
D,Task,"and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . "
D,Task,"For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often "
D,Task,"so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality "
D,Task,"that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . "
D,Task,"And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used comm "
D,Task,"so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . "
D,Task,"Um next please . "
D,Minor,"Now "
D,Task,"people are very frustrated w with their remote controls "
D,Task,"and they for instance uh they don't even find it "
D,Task,"it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home "
D,Task,"and nobody knows where it is . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please comm where are you ? "
B,Task,"Agree . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Like uh something to to like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone "
D,Task,"but you can't phone your your remote control . "
C,Minor,"You can you are . "
A,Other,"Why not ? "
D,Other,"But why not ? Yeah . "
D,Task,"And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls "
D,Task,"that nobody use comm "
D,Task,"in fact they don't even know how to use them comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls . "
D,Task,"And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ "
D,Elicit,"but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ . "
D,Task,"So I think they are bad . "
A,Other,"Okay uh tha that's look great . "
B,Other,"R_S_I_ mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm "
D,Elicit,"nobody has any idea about that ? "
D,Minor,"Well I'll check uh with my "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect . "
D,Other,"Oh comm okay comm "
B,Task,"No comm I don't think so . "
D,Task,"I think it's a technical thing "
D,Minor,"which our "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology comm "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"and those waves have high "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Task,"it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know "
B,Other,"But twenty six percent comm do you know "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"Twenty five . "
A,Minor,"Or something we don't know . Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"but we have to take this into account . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"Every fourth comm you know . Every four some of us knows . "
C,Minor,"Yeah it's People really "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So anyway "
B,Minor,"One of us "
D,Task,"that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user "
D,Minor,"and um "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"what else do I have ? "
D,Task,"Next slide ? "
D,Task,"Ah yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So we've listed a couple of uh "
B,Task,"Functions . "
D,Task,"s uh functions "
D,Task,"that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls "
D,Minor,"and uh well "
D,Task,"the tables look very nice to read "
D,Task,"but what is important "
D,Task,"is to understand that the power button is not used often "
D,Task,"because in general you use it only once per session comm "
D,Task,"but it is very relevant . "
D,Task,"People want to have a power button . "
D,Task,"Channel selection is uh o often used very often used "
D,Task,"and indeed uh very relevant . "
D,Other,"Ah "
D,Task,"now I remember what is R_S_I_ "
D,Task,"it's repetitivity stress injury . "
D,Other,"We have to be careful with that word "
D,Minor,"but uh anyway "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Other,"I continue my presentation "
D,Minor,"so yeah comm "
D,Task,"channel selection is um very important comm very often used . "
D,Task,"Volume is not often used "
D,Task,"but people uh want to have control on volume "
D,Task,"and that makes sense of course . "
D,Task,"And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings comm screen settings comm even teletext and channel settings . "
D,Task,"All of them . they're not often used "
D,Task,"and they are s more or less relevant . "
D,Task,"It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant comm "
D,Task,"even if I personally never use it "
D,Task,"but seems that it's average relevant at least comm so . "
A,Task,"I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext comm "
A,Task,"that it's out of date now because of internet . "
D,Task,"I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this comm "
D,Task,"which is not as uh these "
D,Task,"these two one were had I think ten I think . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"But but if you compare with these ones comm uh I think they scored a one or two . "
D,Task,"Not very relevant comm so "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay "
D,Task,"but just know that people find it somehow relevant . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"That's for the main functions I think "
D,Task,"and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . "
D,Minor,"For instance I think net "
D,Task,"next slide . "
D,Task,"One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control comm "
D,Task,"so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons "
D,Task,"but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . "
D,Task,"So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control "
D,Task,"and as we can see it really depends on the age . "
D,Task,"Young people comm probably because it's a buzz word comm find it very relevant . "
D,Task,"And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? "
D,Task,"I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . "
C,Minor,"'Cause "
D,Task,"If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be "
D,Minor,"so now "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . Okay . "
D,Minor,"this is of course comm "
D,Task,"depends on that . "
D,Task,"And um I don't have any conclusion comm "
D,Task,"I didn't have time "
D,Task,"the meeting was very tight comm "
D,Task,"so that's basically my findings . "
D,Minor,"And uh comm "
D,Elicit,"if you have any question ? "
A,Task,"Mm I think it's good comm okay . You done a good review . "
B,Task,"I got one question comm "
D,Other,"I can go back . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Other,"Yeah one question comm "
D,Task,"yeah ? "
B,Task,"uh you are a Market Expert "
B,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"I am . "
B,Elicit,"should we aim at the young people or not ? "
D,Task,"I think we should aim at the young people . "
D,Task,"But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people comm "
D,Minor,"less than more than "
B,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"then teletext is used less . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Then teletext is useless for them I think comm "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay . "
D,Minor,"But yeah . Nope . "
A,Task,"That's good point . "
C,Task,"Mm comm yep . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Okay . "
D,Elicit,"'Kay ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"now I think it's the turn of the the I'm not sure um "
A,Task,"Of the technical function comm "
A,Minor,"so uh "
D,Task,"So I think it's you comm huh ? "
C,Task,"Uh it's "
D,Other,"No ? "
B,Task,"That's me . "
C,Minor,"techni function of "
A,Minor,"what effect "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"user requiremen "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Wait a second . "
C,Task,"I have to do working design so uh "
A,Other,"Argh . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"That's but this but number three comm "
A,Elicit,"you're "
B,Task,"yes . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"my name is Mark Dwight comm "
B,Task,"and um I am responsible for User Interface Design . "
B,Task,"However comm uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . "
B,Task,"Uh comm as I'm a more an artist "
B,Other,"that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . "
B,Task,"So next slide please . "
A,Task,"Okay . Let's go . "
B,Task,"And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"is not to forget about uh Occam razor . "
B,Task,"We should never complicate things too much . "
B,Task,"We should only make a remote control comm nothing more . Nothing more than this comm just a remote control . "
B,Task,"'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . "
D,Task,"Makes sense . "
B,Task,"So comm make a click comm please . "
B,Task,"So here is this remote control . "
B,Task,"It's quite a standard one comm "
B,Task,"but it's not from a T_V_ comm "
B,Task,"it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . "
B,Task,"But you know comm we can use it for a T_V_ easily . "
B,Task,"Only buttons we need is on off comm volume comm channels and maybe some options or something else comm "
B,Task,"and please make a click comm "
B,Elicit,"compared to this one "
B,Elicit,"which one would you prefer ? "
C,Minor,"It's "
B,Task,"I guess this . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button . "
B,Task,"Sure comm sure . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Maybe it can be yeah middle of like comm between those two "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"li "
B,Task,"and our method is going to be comm provide simple "
A,Other,"Oh sorry . "
B,Task,"simple desires into simple actions . "
D,Task,"Nice . Nice sentence . "
B,Task,"Findings . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Oh sorry . "
B,Task,"Our question of the style comm we should remember that our company "
B,Task,"puts fashion into electronics "
B,Task,"and we should never forget about it . "
B,Task,"Concept . "
C,Minor,"S you should yeah . "
B,Task,"Be simple . Be simple "
B,Task,"and you'll lean on this market . "
B,Task,"Market is a of remote controls you know it better comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"it's very "
B,Minor,"well comm "
B,Task,"it's it's not an easy field to to play comm "
B,Elicit,"you know ? "
B,Task,"So be simple . "
B,Task,"For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . "
B,Task,"It's a really good style comm "
B,Task,"it going to be look like like this . "
B,Task,"It is unbreakable "
B,Task,"and it is very universal . "
B,Task,"W we'll have a screen with a back light "
B,Task,"which can change colours comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and we can put all the options into this screen . "
B,Task,"We'll need only few buttons . "
B,Task,"All the other things can be controlled through the screen . "
B,Task,"And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click comm "
B,Task,"'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something comm you always try to find a good button and click it comm "
B,Task,"but you should do it by touching it "
B,Task,"and finding it easily just by touch . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Press "
B,Task,"I would propose this concept for design comm just few buttons comm a screen with a back light which can change colours comm titanium "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I think comm "
B,Other,"and uh what else ? "
B,Task,"I got just very few and good ideas . "
B,Task,"We need power and volume . "
B,Task,"And let us include two nice features into this device comm "
B,Task,"first comm power on and off can be made fully automatic . "
B,Task,"When you go to the sofa comm take your control "
B,Task,"and point it to the T_V_ comm "
A,Task,"It's off . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"It's on . "
B,Task,"the T_V_ turns on . "
D,Elicit,"And when does it turn off ? "
B,Task,"When you don't touch the control "
B,Task,"but you go out of the "
D,Other,"Oh "
B,Task,"For for enough time "
D,Elicit,"so you have a "
B,Minor,"like uh you "
D,Elicit,"sensing sensor machine that uh knows "
B,Task,"It's a question to our technical design comm our two engineers . "
D,Minor,"Tech "
B,Task,"And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . "
B,Task,"Suppose you set u you set up some volume "
B,Task,"and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room "
B,Task,"and take your control with you . "
B,Task,"Like comm you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something comm and then the volume changes . "
A,Task,"Or you want to go to the kitchen . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"It's easy to do comm "
B,Task,"you just control the "
D,Task,"According to your distance to and the angle maybe comm if you have a stereo system . "
C,Task,"Distance . "
B,Task,"According to the distance . "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh I'm not sure about the screen comm "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? "
D,Elicit,"Uh is it a touch screen by the way ? "
B,Task,"I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left comm right comm up comm down and enter . "
D,Task,"So it gives instructions "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"its main purpose in fact is a back light comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"which change colours comm "
B,Task,"which makes it easier to find comm "
B,Minor,"and each can "
B,Task,"it can respond for your voice comm "
B,Task,"like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily comm "
B,Elicit,"yeah ? "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"So basically that's it . "
A,Task,"Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ "
A,Task,"but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control . "
B,Task,"Can be easily done comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"'cause "
B,Task,"you got simple designs comm "
B,Minor,"y "
B,Task,"we should put it to simple actions . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Let it be universal comm "
B,Task,"so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . "
B,Task,"You want to change tracks "
B,Task,"and you want to adjust volume . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Just few actions comm a few actions for everything . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . S "
B,Task,"All the rest comm we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control "
A,Task,"I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment "
C,Minor,"Mm . Yeah and it mm . "
A,Task,"and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah . "
B,Other,"Okay comm okay . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"but it's quite universal you know . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"We can just extend it to any device . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five comm how would I do can I do that with this ? "
B,Other,"Uh twenty five . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . "
D,Task,"You know these days we have hundreds of channels comm "
D,Task,"that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"In fact I would propose another solution . "
D,Elicit,"Or is it ? "
B,Task,"Basically you use just four or five channels comm "
D,Task,"Most people "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one comm two comm three and five comm "
B,Task,"and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel . "
D,Task,"In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen comm instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three comm twenty eight comm forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"it's it's the same solution comm I think . Hmm . "
D,Minor,"I uh "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"B "
D,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display comm "
C,Task,"like you can uh de you can just button the number "
D,Task,"Go to channel twenty five . "
C,Task,"and then it go "
D,Task,"One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . "
C,Minor,"t because "
D,Task,"So even if they are only watching four or five channels comm I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"But still "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"just because this is one kind of thing they do comm zapping . "
A,Minor,"Yeah uh "
A,Task,"on zap it's only next next next next next comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And it's only next . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"so but you have to "
B,Task,"Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah. . "
B,Task,"Or say this can be back . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers "
C,Task,"and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five "
D,Minor,"So it would be "
C,Minor,"and then "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button "
A,Task,"and you can change mode zapping mode or "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Alright . "
A,Task,"uh current chan "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Other,"Listening more . "
C,Task,"but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so we can have more functions for T_V_ "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Could we carry out some research if we w really need this comm "
B,Elicit,"like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ? "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"I could could uh have a look at that maybe . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Although I don't know . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Alright ? "
B,Other,"Thanks for your attention . "
A,Elicit,"Uh you're finish ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So now the technical aspects of this new device . "
A,Other,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Two . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"if "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
A,Elicit,"You prefer it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh as you know comm I am mister Ramaro . "
C,Task,"I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices "
C,Task,"and I previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators . "
C,Other,"So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device comm like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . "
C,Task,"So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . "
C,Task,"So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions comm what we want on this portable device . "
C,Minor,"And usually this "
C,Task,"so to do these functions we need an interface comm "
C,Task,"which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . "
C,Task,"And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message "
C,Task,"and then it will process by the chip "
C,Task,"and then it will generate some information to the main device . "
C,Task,"It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . "
C,Task,"Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Minor,"basically we need "
C,Task,"uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control "
C,Task,"mainly the energy source like the battery "
C,Task,"and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want comm "
C,Task,"and then we have some chip comm "
C,Task,"it's mainly digital signal processing chip because "
C,Task,"since we are I am one doing mostly digital uh devices "
C,Task,"we ought to have some kind of processor "
C,Task,"which take care of all these functions "
C,Task,"and put it in some digital format . "
C,Task,"And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source "
C,Task,"which sends the information to the main device . "
C,Task,"Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations comm "
C,Task,"and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s comm "
C,Task,"so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah comm "
C,Task,"because the people don't use one particular brand so "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"or at least we have more more than five brands comm which are really good . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So we need to check their specifications "
C,Task,"and do their uh encryption "
C,Task,"that's passing information to the T_V_ device . "
C,Task,"So we need to have particular encryption codes . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Then comm components comm "
C,Task,"so we have the main uh energy source "
C,Task,"and then we will have some buttons "
C,Task,"and then we will have infrared uh source "
C,Task,"and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . "
C,Task,"Uh since I don't have much time "
C,Other,"so I'll input the connections to all this components . "
C,Elicit,"And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard comm or mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I'm sure comm "
C,Task,"because since our User Interface speech recognition "
C,Task,"and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"we can have another comm like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Since we have some kind of uh energy "
C,Task,"this is our "
C,Task,"this normal battery comm "
C,Task,"so this battery comm once you s switch on it will take power "
C,Task,"and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip "
C,Task,"so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser "
C,Task,"and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user "
A,Minor,"On "
C,Minor,"so you just "
A,Other,"Uh train it comm okay . "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"so that we just use simple recog "
B,Task,"Too complex . "
C,Task,"no "
D,Task,"But uh very very good to sell . "
C,Minor,"but but "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"even in "
C,Task,"you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them comm "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and ha ha you cannot use my remote control comm "
D,Task,"because it's targeted to me . Whatever . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And what about the price of this component ? "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that comm "
A,Minor,"It mm "
A,Other,"okay . "
D,Task,"Hmm . Cheap . "
C,Task,"because we want to have uh millions and in bulk comm "
D,Task,"Millions . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"so we can make really simp "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"and we want to make really simple device "
D,Task,"Cheap . "
C,Task,"because we have only very few words like like power comm switch on or some like "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"then we'll have something like this um "
C,Task,"we'll have volume "
C,Task,"and then we will have s particular channel comm "
C,Task,"so users can listen . "
D,Elicit,"The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"or or it will be something like volume comm up comm down . "
C,Minor,"Ye "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"a user can use any kind of sender "
C,Task,"but they should have this prompt volume and then "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"With a keywords and yeah . "
C,Task,"yeah "
C,Task,"volume and decrease or increase comm "
C,Task,"so we try to only recognise those words "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Couple of words . "
C,Task,"and and because we can't really say user to say same wording "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm mm . "
C,Task,"then it become more mechanical and yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"And then we can have channel they can say comm okay I want eight comm "
C,Task,"because we don't know like users have different programmes comm "
C,Task,"I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh "
C,Task,"so we just want channel number comm "
C,Task,"we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else "
D,Minor,"Of course uh it has to be "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"because "
C,Task,"it will be complicated "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"so we'll have only these three uh main basic "
C,Task,"uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"it's it it will be take care of our main mm . "
B,Minor,"No you know "
B,Task,"it's a conceptual question comm "
B,Task,"'cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes "
B,Task,"like a user taking his remote control "
B,Task,"and shouting into it comm volume up comm volume up comm "
D,Minor,"But then I think you you "
B,Task,"and and he's coming you know comm he's really annoyed with this comm down comm up comm down . "
D,Task,"First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . "
A,Task,"No comm in no not only speech comm yeah . "
D,Task,"It's on top of using the button . "
B,Other,"Okay comm "
B,Elicit,"for this budget like twelve Euros . "
A,Task,"I it's an option . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on comm on and off comm this processor "
C,Minor,"and This really comm "
C,Task,"suppose like here we have our main chip "
C,Task,"which controls power comm volume and this part and this D_S_P_s . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Again comm this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ "
C,Task,"then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form comm like volume and like this key . "
C,Task,"So it may not be like very expensive comm "
B,Other,"Okay. . "
C,Task,"because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control "
D,Task,"T_V_ . "
C,Minor,"so "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and we have only few things here "
A,Task,"Sho to to train comm okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ? "
B,Task,"Like comm if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like "
C,Task,"Um uh uh this point we didn't consider "
B,Task,"roll 'em up "
B,Task,"or roll 'em down . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"because it's it's very expensive "
D,Task,"Very expensive comm "
D,Elicit,"no ? "
C,Task,"because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros "
A,Minor,"And well comm "
A,Elicit,"what about the idea of automatic on off on the button comm yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Mm why ? "
C,Minor,"and "
B,Minor,"That's just "
D,Elicit,"And volume control . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"even automatic on off is also a bit problematic comm "
C,Task,"because it different criteria for different people "
C,Task,"like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote "
C,Task,"and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off "
D,Minor,"So but uh "
C,Minor,"and "
D,Elicit,"Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? "
D,Task,"So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . "
D,Task,"We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings . "
C,Minor,"Yay yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah that can be possible comm especially for power settings comm "
C,Minor,"so user can say okay comm suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Wouldn't that make uh arguments ? "
C,Minor,"They can make "
D,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
A,Other,"I want uh "
D,Other,"That's no problem comm we will sell more . "
C,Minor,"Yeah we can have "
A,Other,"And we can increase this the strength "
B,Other,"We got a really good Market Expert . "
D,Other,"Yeah exactly . "
A,Minor,"y you can buy one with "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Let's send more comm let's sell more . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
A,Elicit,"You have mm something else to say ? Uh . "
C,Task,"Uh comm not very much comm "
C,Minor,"like yeah . "
A,Other,"No . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Other,"Thank you . Yep . "
A,Other,"thanks . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Can you just "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Other,"mm "
A,Other,"mm I think comm okay comm we're just on time . "
A,Minor,"Um mm mm . So comm "
A,Task,"we're now going to l have the lunch break . "
D,Task,"Mm great . "
A,Task,"Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work comm "
A,Task,"and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting comm "
A,Task,"and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components "
A,Minor,"so uh "
A,Task,"you will focus on the component concept um "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept "
C,Minor,"Mark will "
A,Task,"and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I think that's all . "
A,Task,"And we have um maybe we have to we say comm only for T_V_ comm not teletext ? "
A,Task,"Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible . "
C,Task,"Uh it's in current price comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Difficult . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But speech recogniser can be possible . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm implemented . "
A,Task,"O okay comm "
A,Task,"we can think about that . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"And um "
A,Elicit,"do you see something else ? "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Elicit,"Uh comm should it be equipped with the uh comm with uh speakers ? "
D,Other,"Speakers in the remote cont "
B,Task,"Like comm you want to find it comm you shout "
D,Other,"Oh yeah . "
B,Task,"control comm "
A,Other,"Uh yeah "
A,Minor,"that's "
B,Task,"and it answers is I'm here ? Or "
D,Task,"It just beeps . "
D,Task,"That would be enough . "
B,Other,"Just beeps ? "
A,Task,"Or maybe you want to phone him . "
D,Task,"Something very cheap . "
D,Task,"But that's ex that's expensive . Uh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Minor,"Since now all "
A,Other,"yeah ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"especially the power comm it really consumes "
A,Minor,"Think "
C,Task,"because it should be all the time on "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Minor,"and "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them "
A,Minor,"And uh "
D,Minor,"and and they "
A,Task,"And it's answered . "
D,Task,"because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I can't whistle . "
B,Task,"No comm no comm I can't . "
D,Other,"You can't whistle . "
D,Other,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"Or a clap . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Clap clap clap it's a good "
D,Elicit,"You can clap . Can you ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Clap is good . "
A,Task,"I I think it's universal . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Tak "
D,Task,"Just a suggestion . "
A,Other,"What about people without hand ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"With only one hand ? "
C,Task,"Yeah I think it's good . "
D,Other,"These are not our target people . "
A,Minor,"Mm uh okay . "
C,Task,"But it's a good feature I guess yeah "
C,Task,"we need to think about more how to incorporate it . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
B,Task,"Just don't interfere with other devices like "
B,Task,"'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Oh "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Elicit,"that's e that already exists "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"okay okay . "
B,Task,"I got it at my home comm like . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Oh yeah comm you do have . "
B,Other,"Oops . "
D,Other,"Wow . You're trendy . "
C,Minor,"Ah it's "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm so "
A,Task,"let's to think "
A,Minor,"s so that "
D,Task,"Think about it . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"I think that could be in the component uh concept uh . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"It yes . "
D,Elicit,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Good "
D,Elicit,"we're done ? "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"let's go to lunch . "
D,Minor,"Right comm "
D,Other,"thanks . "
C,Other,"Thank you comm thank you very much . "
