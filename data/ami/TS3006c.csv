D,Other,"Hello . "
A,Minor,". "
A,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Yes comm I made it . "
D,Task,"English from now on . "
C,Minor,". "
D,Elicit,"Drawing or "
A,Task,"Yeah just testing . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Mm ? "
C,Other,"Just kidding . "
A,Other,"English . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Task,"So annoying . "
A,Task,"Break is over . "
D,Task,"Ooh it works . "
A,Other,"Whoo . "
A,Task,"Spicy . "
D,Task,"Spicy . "
D,Elicit,"Where are are all the other presentations ? "
C,Task,"I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be "
D,Elicit,"The conceptual or "
C,Task,"yeah I think so . Yeah comm conceptual design . "
D,Task,"Ah . Because I see only my own presentation "
C,Other,"What or whatever does it "
C,Task,"No no no comm "
C,Task,"can you go back one ? "
D,Other,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh 'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre "
C,Task,"yeah components design comm that's it . "
D,Elicit,"This ? "
D,Other,"I'll just put it in there . "
A,Task,"So comm he's coming . "
C,Task,". I did get a bit more done than the last time comm "
D,Task,"Or not . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Oh okay . "
C,Task,"'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the "
D,Task,"Ah comm "
D,Task,"I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but "
A,Minor,"Ah . She . "
A,Task,"You can look at the final report comm "
A,Task,"'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such comm "
A,Other,"so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . "
D,Task,"Move to meeting room . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there comm "
A,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint comm so it takes me forever to get something done with it . "
D,Task,"Yeah me too comm . "
B,Task,"I I've got the same problem as well . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Here we go again . "
A,Other,"Welcome . "
A,Task,"Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh f the remote control has to support . "
C,Minor,"Thi "
A,Elicit,"So who wants go . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Yes . "
C,Elicit,"Who wants to start ? "
A,Minor,"Yes ? "
D,Other,"Me first again or "
A,Task,"Yeah sure . Doesn't matter . "
B,Task,"Oh . No . Yeah . No problem "
D,Task,"yeah . Alright . "
D,Elicit,"Did you open it already or "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"no . Ah . "
D,Other,"Ah . "
D,Other,"Yes . "
D,Task,"So welcome to the marketing presentation once again . "
D,Task,"Um this time about trendwatching . "
D,Task,"Uh well there has been inv investigation again comm in the in the remote control market . "
D,Task,"Uh it shows a number of developments . "
D,Other,"Uh I will address them uh in a moment . "
D,Task,"Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public comm because that's our public . "
D,Minor,"Um well "
D,Task,"fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing comm uh shoes and furniture . "
D,Task,"And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . "
D,Other,"So um the developments I will address them "
D,Task,"oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . "
D,Task,"So to give you an idea . "
D,Task,"Um well the developments ? "
D,Task,"Uh development one . "
D,Minor,"Uh well "
D,Task,"most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . "
D,Task,"Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . "
D,Task,"And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . "
D,Task,"Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . "
D,Task,"I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition comm "
C,Minor,"Sound . "
D,Task,"so I don't expect that to be a problem . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah uh uh . "
D,Task,"And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspectcommw which was twice as important as the third aspect . "
D,Task,"So um that kind of gets you this ratios . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention . "
A,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . "
D,Task,"Um well technolog technological innovation comm we've covered that pretty much I guess . "
D,Task,"Um and easy to use comm I don't think that will be problem . "
D,Task,"So my point of attention is especially this part . "
D,Task,"That this will be a crux . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So that was the marketing uh presentation . "
D,Task,"I had only one document left . "
C,Other,"And shall I go first ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . No . I I don't mi I don't mind . "
C,Minor,"So I "
B,Minor,"That's "
D,Task,"So kind of this "
C,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"Do you want to go first ? Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah sure . No . "
D,Task,"So a k a small example . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Kind of this this look . "
D,Task,"Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing comm and and some fruit and colours "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
D,Task,"Just made a quick design . "
A,Task,"Cool . "
B,Task,"It's better than than my uh drawing . "
D,Other,"Alright . "
C,Unlab,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Yeah you're just the user interface hmm ? "
B,Task,"Yeah okay but I have to design the "
C,Other,"Uh components . "
A,Task,"Yeah layout . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Oh no . "
A,Task,"Yeah okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . It's okay . "
A,Task,"You probably opened it . "
C,Task,"Yeah true . Um "
A,Task,"F_ five . "
D,Task,"F_ five . "
C,Minor,"Alright . So "
C,Task,"I'm dealing with the components design . "
C,Minor,"Um let's see . "
C,Task,"I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . "
C,Task,"And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . "
C,Task,"That's why I had to comm wanted to go first . "
C,Task,"Well they gave me um an idea about what people want . "
C,Task,"We're f mainly focusing on this group comm but I want to make the distinction clear . "
C,Task,"Uh I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . "
C,Task,"But it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type . "
C,Task,"If you comm the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh comm which looks like fruits you know comm you can "
C,Task,"and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . "
C,Task,"So this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . "
C,Task,"There is a lot of um factors involved in choosing the components . "
C,Task,"There's a lot of options that we have to discuss . "
C,Task,"Uh for example the energy source . we have four types . "
C,Task,"The basic battery . "
C,Task,"Uh we have a hand dynamo comm "
C,Task,"which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing comm if you shake it . "
C,Task,"Which will be fun for toddlers right comm if they wanna use the "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And uh of course solar cells . "
C,Task,"But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product . "
D,Task,"Wi an indoors . "
C,Minor,"So uh my "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Yeah okay . "
C,Task,"yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia comm they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know . "
A,Task,"Calculator's can do it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So that's not cool either . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"So um "
C,Task,"for the uh a case comm there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . "
C,Task,"Single curved comm which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . "
C,Task,"Or the double curved . "
C,Task,"Um I wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet comm "
C,Task,"but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh the case materials . "
C,Task,"Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic comm the wood and the titanium . "
C,Task,"I would definitely go for rubber "
C,Task,"'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Um poo comm "
C,Minor,"this is a lot of text . "
C,Task,"I wasn't able to organise this yet . "
C,Task,"We have yeah several uh interface designs . "
C,Task,"Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus comm "
C,Task,"but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons comm for the the arrow buttons . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Pushbuttons . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So that's not really interesting . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Electronics ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use "
C,Task,"the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production comm 'cause they they can print it better . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"Yeah . I think this is about it . "
C,Task,"Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences . "
C,Task,"I first uh chose for the battery comm 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious comm easiest choice to go to . "
C,Task,"But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy comm "
C,Task,"where you have to move the thing to be able to use it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"As an optional uh feature . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or combine uh both with a with one uh "
D,Task,"I guess we can only choose one . "
A,Task,"Uh I think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the "
C,Minor,"Yeah maybe we "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . "
C,Task,"But it is more longlasting comm that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . "
D,Task,"Yeah . And it's more fun . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"I didn't receive any info uh . "
C,Task,"And it's also more fun yeah . "
C,Task,"I always chuck my uh remote control around comm so "
D,Task,"Yeah comm just playing with it "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and especially when the material's rubber . It can be done comm I mean comm you can't harm it comm "
A,Task,"S yeah it's safe . "
C,Task,"Yeah y exactly . "
D,Task,"so it's a perfect combination I guess . "
B,Minor,"And throw it . "
C,Task,"You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So that's the end of it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Uh go ahead . "
A,Task,"'Kay next . "
D,Elicit,"So double curved is like this comm this comm this comm or "
C,Task,"No it means curved in two dimensions . "
C,Task,"So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box comm but then with curves on one dimension . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . Like three D_ . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Also in in height ? "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Can we uh "
B,Task,"One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . "
B,Task,"We were going to use that . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Minor,"Yeah um "
B,Task,"yeah that's one thing uh which I'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control . "
C,Minor,"Design ? "
A,Task,"Well the visual representation is not there with speech "
B,Task,"No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and "
A,Minor,"but you can "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So okay . "
A,Minor,"Just yeah . "
A,Task,"I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So I don't think you have to design anything else for that . "
D,Task,"Yeah with the programme . "
B,Elicit,"But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options comm for the simple buttons ? "
A,Task,"Both . "
B,Elicit,"For for everything comm "
B,Task,"also for the advanced options ? Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh we have this very uh basic uh trendy design . "
B,Task,"Everybody says it so that's what's uh "
B,Minor,"yeah um "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . "
B,Task,"That's yeah obvious . "
B,Minor,"Um yeah . "
B,Task,"Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . "
B,Task,"And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options . "
D,Task,"And and the and the buttons that you need to control it comm I guess . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um yeah "
B,Task,"design has to be very attractive "
B,Task,"but that's your your op your yeah . "
B,Task,"you have to uh delete this "
B,Task,"but this is the the the simple uh layout . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . "
A,Task,"That would be the back . "
B,Minor,"I'm "
B,Task,"The back . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Back and okay . "
D,Task,"Back and okay . "
B,Task,"Back and okay yeah . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
A,Elicit,"You did read the minutes I wrote ? "
B,Other,"What ? "
A,Elicit,"You did read the minutes I wrote ? "
B,Task,"A little bit I think but not not everything w "
C,Minor,"I "
A,Task,"Oh okay "
A,Task,"'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . So "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Oh I uh didn't read that . "
A,Other,"I hate doing work for nothing . "
B,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"But this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"I wanted to to categorise everything . "
B,Task,"Uh with a speech display uh yeah comm sound comm everything you you noted in your uh minutes . "
B,Task,"Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light . "
B,Task,"So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous so that's an a also an option . "
B,Task,"Um that was it . "
A,Elicit,"That was it ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . Uh "
A,Other,"again . Ugh . "
A,Task,"Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? "
A,Task,"Uh energy source comm chip type comm case type . And user interface . "
A,Task,"But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . "
A,Task,"So we only comm we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . "
D,Minor,"No . "
A,Task,"Uh the case would be doubly curved . So "
D,Task,"Rubber material . "
C,Task,"And rubber . Rubber material . "
A,Task,"Rubber material . "
A,Task,"And that's the only thing we have left . "
C,Task,"Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function . "
A,Task,"Oh okay . No it's easy . "
D,Minor,"So that's uh "
D,Elicit,"is that is that the advanced chip ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Advanced chip . Okay . "
D,Other,"Wow . "
C,Task,"Otherwise you would have a simple chip comm just for pressing buttons . But we need more . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
D,Other,"Kinetic . Double curved . "
C,Task,"I'm just thinking comm this is not my department comm but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost comm "
A,Minor,"Too . "
C,Minor,"to be able to m "
A,Task,"Uh I didn't get any info on this . So "
C,Task,"So 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece . "
D,Minor,". "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's gonna be difficult huh ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? "
A,Task,"I have total here . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah I don't know . "
A,Task,"I didn't get any information about that so "
B,Minor,". "
B,Task,"We're going to produce it in uh China so it's no problem . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Child labour man comm we love it . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm so it's cheap . "
A,Other,"Who doesn't . "
A,Other,"Uh let's see . Is there a new thing ? "
D,Task,"Um well the interface type supplements . "
A,Task,"Yeah the interface comm "
A,Minor,"maybe can "
B,Task,"Uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh yeah . "
A,Other,"Ooh . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? "
A,Task,"And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder . "
C,Other,"Um let me see . "
C,Other,"Wait a sec . "
D,Task,"If you go to your homepage or something comm you should "
C,Other,"Yeah I'm going there now . "
D,Task,"get your own information . "
C,Other,"Inspiration . "
D,Task,"I got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there comm so "
C,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"Ah you didn't draw it yourself . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"Ah . "
D,Task,"Too less time . "
C,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Yeah comm also the menu . "
C,Minor,"yeah maybe it's "
D,Minor,"Yeah that that w "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah I was thinking of that also comm with with a with a uh arrow . "
C,Minor,"Maybe it's easier "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Arrow . "
B,Minor,"Arrow yeah . "
D,Task,"So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah perfect . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here . "
A,Task,"'S the target group . "
B,Minor,"S yeah . "
C,Task,"S see this is the the the standard traditional type comm where the form uh yeah serves the function comm you know . "
D,Other,"Oh yeah . "
A,Other,"Yeah sure . "
C,Task,"It's like really basic . "
C,Task,"But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"This is what we're looking for . "
C,Task,"And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions . "
A,Task,"Oh okay . I see . "
C,Task,"Not only like this but it has to be "
A,Task,"Yeah also like this . So you can hold it . "
C,Task,"exactly . "
C,Task,"It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation comm the module . It has to be like the the Game Cube comm you know comm "
C,Task,"where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But it has also to "
B,Task,"it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people . "
B,Task,"Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . So "
C,Minor,"It ha "
A,Minor,". "
A,Task,"The children's story . Yeah I've got it . "
C,Task,"Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually comm "
A,Task,"Distinction . Yeah . "
C,Task,"'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours comm and with a lot of shape . "
C,Minor,"And "
C,Task,"Yeah comm and the and the rubber comm it it will look cheap always comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"The colour "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay but the the colours comm you you can make it uh make the colours with LEDs uh beneath the the buttons . "
C,Minor,"you know comm with the "
B,Task,"If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"There is mobile phones comm in which you can change the colour also of the lights . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Maybe we should consider this function . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"To customise it and so "
C,Task,"I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and people who want something comm you know comm different comm or more uh design comm they can go for one colour "
A,Task,"Different . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"like uh for example this uh photo th camera . "
A,Task,"Camera . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Cool . "
D,Task,"S underwater uh "
A,Task,"Yeah submarine . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Personally I think it's really ugly . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Just give me the thing that it's inside there "
A,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"maybe I'm too old for this stuff . "
B,Task,"Very cheap uh cheap look . "
A,Task,"Yeah but this this the is for the . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So those I think are all my "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Minor,". "
C,Other,"oh . "
A,Task,"Ah yeah bright colours . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Also a kind of rubber uh "
C,Task,"And this is comm this is with the curved that I mean . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's singly curved . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"That should be nice . "
A,Task,"Well we could make a compromise between that . "
A,Task,"But I don't know if it's worth the effort . "
C,Elicit,"A compromise between what ? "
A,Task,"Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public . "
D,Minor,"So s "
C,Elicit,"This comm this would be uh single curved uh ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah there's only in in this dimension . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Like this . So curvy or not . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Also . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Exactly . Exactly . "
D,Task,"Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? "
A,Task,"Yeah that would be an option . "
A,Elicit,"I don't know what you think . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I think the "
C,Task,"I mean our aim is to make something different right ? "
C,Task,"To make something new . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"I would go for the double curved . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette comm where you have the shape for your thumb . "
A,Task,"Yeah I'd agree . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So it kind of holds nicely comm something like that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . "
C,Task,"Well this is really your decision but "
B,Task,"If you have uh it have it in your hand comm you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . "
C,Task,"Yeah . As well . "
C,Task,"You can make a trigger button or something like that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Something to shoot at your television "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"or that that is the confirmation button or something comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"that you scroll with your thumb comm with the arrows comm and then confirm . "
B,Minor,"That's "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"That would be a nice way to use it but "
C,Task,"I mean comm yeah comm I'm thinking big already comm "
C,Task,"and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand I think . "
A,Task,"Different . "
A,Task,"Stands out . "
A,Minor,"Or "
A,Task,"Oh yeah a one hand uh solution . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So from top view it looks kinda like this . "
D,Task,"But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . "
D,Minor,"Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have "
A,Task,"can turn it maybe . "
A,Task,"To switch from buttons to interface hmm . If you turn it a little . "
D,Task,"Maybe you can c have this kind of shape . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Minor,". "
D,Task,"A little upwards . So that the screen is more "
A,Task,"Oh yeah . Least you can easily see it . "
D,Task,"towards yourself comm so you can easily see your screen . "
C,Minor,"How about "
D,Task,"Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . "
D,Task,"So then you have double double curved in some way . "
D,Task,"So this this is so the screen is positioned over here . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Something like that . "
D,Task,"And the buttons are more comm "
D,Task,"well it's very thick now but "
C,Task,"Yeah I understand what you mean . "
D,Minor,"That's uh that's "
C,Task,"How about we do a uh a pop-up screen comm like the laptop . "
A,Task,"If you can uh flip . "
C,Task,"So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or "
C,Minor,"And then if you want "
C,Task,"Yeah . Something like that . "
A,Task,"Uh so you have a the the side view . "
D,Task,"But then the side view can be straight . If you have a pop-up screen . "
D,Task,"But I dunno if that's too expensive . "
A,Task,"So and you want to be able to "
D,Task,"I mean maybe it's too much "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"make this "
C,Task,"No uh like "
A,Minor,". "
C,Other,"I would draw it like this . "
C,Task,"Let's say this is the side view . "
C,Task,"That you have a a screen that will come up here comm and can go down that way . "
C,Other,"If you know what I mean . "
B,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
C,Task,"So that it would come up like that . "
A,Task,"Okay so the buttons are on top here comm and you flip it over that way . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"or preferably even keep the simple buttons here comm and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Oh the advanced buttons . Right . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Right . Yeah that's good idea . "
B,Minor,"That's "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But you you want "
C,Task,"F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? "
B,Task,"okay . You just want to hide them all ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So w w "
B,Minor,"The oh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No not all because you need most of them comm the arrow buttons . "
A,Task,"But you can hide the okay and the back uh button . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"And the menu button also because when you flip it open "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically . "
C,Other,"Oh "
C,Task,"Activate and th the yeah . "
D,Task,"So okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . "
A,Elicit,"Why ? "
A,Task,"You could just make it mechanical . "
C,Task,"True . True . "
C,Task,"But you can make a comm yeah comm you can make a trigger here . "
C,Task,"You know a simple uh with a "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it comm in combination with your "
B,Minor,"That's "
B,Minor,"but it's it's not "
C,Task,"Yeah . Exactly . "
B,Task,"it's not very uh very strong uh yeah if you drop it one time . "
D,Task,"True . It uh c it can go open . "
C,Task,"Well yeah the the idea of it was comm is that because you close it comm you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . "
A,Task,"If you cover it with rubber . "
D,Task,"An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"And "
C,Task,"Exactly . Exactly . "
A,Task,"Yeah . So it can bounce . "
C,Task,"We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm uh "
D,Task,"It's very no it's very strong . "
C,Task,"Th it's very solid yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah okay so that that may work . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That actually will offer some extra protection for the "
A,Elicit,"Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah I was thinking comm if if you have your hand comm "
A,Minor,"What kind of "
C,Minor,"it this is your th "
A,Task,"Harder . "
D,Task,"Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess comm "
D,Task,"so maybe you should try it over there . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Task,"If this is your thumb comm and this is your hand like that . "
C,Task,"With your uh wrist . "
C,Task,"That you comm that it would be kind of shape like this comm you know . "
C,Task,"So it's easier to hold in your hand comm to y f "
B,Task,"But when you are left-handed comm that's that's a problem . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh yeah . Yeah of course . "
C,Task,"Yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this . "
A,Task,"Maybe can design two versions . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But that's that's very expensive uh "
C,Task,"Like like you drew here . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre . "
C,Minor,"Give it "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And ergonomical shape . Yeah . "
C,Task,"I would give it a female shape "
C,Other,"but uh yeah . Anyway . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"The female shape yeah . "
A,Other,"With two uh "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Obviously . Make it more appealing to guys . "
B,Task,"We we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse comm with which you can change uh "
C,Minor,"I mean "
A,Task,"Oh yeah . "
A,Minor,"Some uh k esk uh yeah . "
B,Minor,"and so if you "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah but but that's optional for later I guess . "
D,Minor,"I mean comm we have to make "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah but we have hardware inside comm which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape . "
B,Minor,"Some "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah we we better so choose one "
A,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"And also the screen comm you cannot mould it . "
C,Other,"You know kind of thing . "
B,Task,"No no no no . "
D,Task,"Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But that's the kind of the idea comm "
D,Task,"so it lays good in the hand comm "
D,Task,"and then on on the side with with your thumb comm "
C,Minor,"And then you can "
C,Task,"You can place the screen here comm which can come . "
D,Minor,"you you can you can use comm "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"you can use the button option "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So the keywords are primary co colours comm spongey ? "
C,Minor,"And but then I w I would "
D,Minor,"Spongey . "
C,Task,"I would do the arrows here comm kind of thing . "
D,Minor,"Spongey can be reached by means of "
C,Task,"Those buttons ? And the simple buttons here comm "
B,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"so that "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the the arrows ? "
C,Task,"I Uh y eah that's what I mean . "
B,Task,"No the arrow's over here . "
C,Task,"The arrows over here comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and here the s simple uh "
D,Task,"and then numbers . "
A,Minor,"Buttons . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Alright . "
A,Task,"I think that uh it's a nice design . "
D,Task,"Uh pretty nice design . Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's cool . "
D,Task,"Yeah it looks uh pretty fancy . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Minor,"Yeah that's "
D,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Uh bananas wierd shape and other fruits also comm "
D,Task,"so it's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
D,Elicit,"I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? "
C,Minor,"we could make "
D,Task,"Like some soft green or something ? "
A,Task,"Orange or something . "
D,Minor,"Or and then "
B,Task,"Or blue ? Dark blue or "
D,Task,"Oh yeah yeah comm dark blue "
D,Task,"and then and then very bright comm uh a yellow banana comm an orange comm uh a green apple comm stuff like that comm "
C,Minor,"We should use "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"with very uh bright tones I guess . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah w we need very primary colours comm like bright red comm bright yellow . "
D,Minor,"So you have something like "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah okay yeah . "
B,Minor,"If you we uh yeah . "
B,Task,"If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour comm then it's just a neutral colour comm "
B,Task,"also for the for the more uh yeah for the people . "
D,Other,"Mm . "
D,Task,"That doesn't really work . To draw comm I guess . "
A,Task,"Huh cool . "
A,Minor,"No it's "
A,Minor,". "
D,Elicit,"Oh . What's this ? "
A,Task,"Yeah it's text . "
D,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"N no you have to exit . "
D,Minor,"Hm . "
A,Task,"You could also make line with uh "
B,Minor,"So that's "
D,Task,"Yeah . Two hours further . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"thickness . Oh . "
B,Task,"So that's blue . "
D,Task,"Oh . Wh why not go for the twenty ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . That's what I call painting . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Y "
D,Task,"So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"and then on top of that . "
D,Task,"It's pretty nice . "
D,Minor,"And then uh "
D,Minor,"Oh "
A,Task,"Some yellow . "
D,Task,"Yeah with some some yellow banana "
A,Task,"Banana colour . "
D,Minor,"Like . "
C,Task,"And how about some uh some flashing standby lights ? "
C,Task,"Like you have on the Samsung comm "
C,Task,"well I don't like to call brands phones comm "
C,Minor,"the you know that "
C,Task,"'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often . "
D,Task,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"So it not not only in in the colours of the LEDs comm that we want something to keep it visible at all times comm "
C,Elicit,"or "
D,Elicit,"How do you mean ? "
C,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it comm basically . "
D,Minor,"Some some "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Exactly . "
A,Task,"Well I think it's a bit too much but "
B,Minor,"Maybe a "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah an orange . "
D,Task,"Well alright well this is more like purple I guess comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"but it's should be more real dark blue comm so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"So uh yeah . "
D,Task,"That would be a nice uh nice device I guess . "
B,Elicit,"And which which colour should uh should I give the the display ? Uh "
B,Minor,"Or "
A,Minor,"Who ? "
D,Elicit,"I mean comm the the colour of the background of the display ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six five thousand uh colour comm so yeah too expensive . "
A,Task,"And then you can use yellow or semething . "
A,Elicit,"Why not ? "
A,Minor,"Aye . "
D,Task,"So just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Green is too old-fashioned . But blue comm blue's okay . J "
C,Task,"As long as you loo use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? "
C,Minor,"So that people with uh with "
A,Minor,"Like this . "
D,Task,"White backlight comm and dark . "
B,Task,"Dark uh letters comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Whatever which is visible . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions . "
D,Task,"I mean it's hard to tell uh I dunno . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And also for people who are a bit colourblind . "
A,Task,"Colourblind yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . True . "
A,Task,"No so that's mostly red and green I believe . "
D,Elicit,"Which which uh colour should the buttons be ? "
B,Task,"That's adjustable . "
A,Other,"Woah . "
D,Elicit,"Why adjustable ? "
A,Elicit,"All all buttons ? "
B,Task,"Yeah ? Or not . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"No uh "
B,Task,"That's how we are going to make it uh more trendy . "
B,Elicit,"Or is it uh too expensive ? "
D,Task,"But maybe I mean they have to they have to have some colour right ? "
A,Task,"It's difficult . "
D,Task,"And if the background is very dark blue "
A,Minor,"Blue . "
A,Task,"Maybe green . "
C,Task,"But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah you can "
C,Task,"Like the pictures I showed you guys . "
C,Task,"Those things were all like like bright red comm bright red comm flashy . "
D,Minor,"Yeah ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm flashy . "
D,Minor,"So more like "
A,Other,"Mm bzz . "
D,Task,"Doesn't work very well . "
D,Task,"Uh . More like this colour . "
C,Task,"Yeah something like that comm something that stands out more . "
D,Task,"And then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"But then then again comm which colour should the buttons be ? "
D,Elicit,"The the press buttons . Should they be white or black or "
A,Task,"Red maybe . "
B,Task,"And it it looks quite cheap comm that colour I think . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Black . "
B,Minor,"It's it's not "
C,Task,"The green ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . I dunno . "
D,Task,"Yeah but it's pretty fresh comm on the other side . "
A,Elicit,"Why ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"It's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment . "
B,Task,"It's it's trendy okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"My couch is in that colour . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"Ooh . . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Well it works pretty well . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And then time was up . "
A,Task,"Uh not yet . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Elicit,"Do you get a pop-up if we "
D,Minor,". "
A,Task,"Yeah within five minutes yeah . "
D,Elicit,"That you have five minutes left or "
C,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Y left yeah left and then uh I have to kick you out . "
D,Task,"So something like this . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That should be pretty nice colour . "
D,Task,"But maybe the buttons comm all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"No "
D,Task,"Because the of the green . "
C,Minor,"that's actu "
B,Elicit,"But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"They have LEDs but they have a colour . "
C,Task,"Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"They will see one of each as grey . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But if you use uh green on blue comm those kind of colours will look the same . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I think . "
D,Elicit,"So red buttons are okay ? "
C,Task,"I think so . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"That that's a default uh setting . The the red buttons . "
A,Task,"You can make them red . "
A,Task,"Yeah . But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light . "
D,Elicit,"How do you mean ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh they they don't determine the colour that much comm I think . "
B,Task,"Okay . Yeah "
B,Task,"I I was think about a red uh red LEDs and blue LEDs and "
A,Task,"'Cause you have to print on them you have a background "
D,Task,"No that's that's too busy I guess . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Each number is transparent . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh partly but you have to print on the number . Or the the sign . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So you can't "
D,Task,"You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . "
A,Task,"change the colour so "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So just an extra "
A,Task,"Bit of light . "
C,Minor,"You can "
D,Task,"bit of light and attention . "
C,Task,"what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button comm with uh one coloured LED behind it . "
A,Task,"Bit of feedback . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So that the whole button will shine "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"as the colour the "
C,Task,"And if you think about easy to use buttons comm we have to comm well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands comm "
C,Task,"but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb comm if you hold the machine . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay with "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Other,"Don't mean to discourage you "
A,Task,"but uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . "
A,Task,"Next thirty minutes to design something so "
C,Task,"Ah comm right . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"And the "
A,Task,"You will do the evaluation . "
D,Elicit,"Of the product ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Which we don't have yet . "
A,Task,"Yeah uh about "
D,Elicit,"So wh how should I do that ? "
A,Task,"Yeah I don't know . "
D,Task,"Oh okay . "
A,Task,"You probably get a mail . "
D,Task,"Or you you or you send it to me . "
D,Minor,"Or just "
D,Elicit,"because you are going to design it on this board right ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . Once they are finished . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . "
D,Task,"Yeah . I I probably get instruction on that comm how to do that comm "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so I make another presentation I guess . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I kn I know what's gonna happen in in yeah so "
A,Task,"About . Yeah . You have the basic idea . "
D,Task,"I've a basic idea . "
A,Task,"And you two uh are going to do this . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? "
A,Task,"Look-and-feel and "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Good luck . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
C,Other,"Thanks . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Alright so that's uh "
A,Minor,"So I "
A,Task,"uh make new page and uh be creative . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
B,Elicit,"But we have to do it at this moment comm after th this meeting ? "
A,Task,"Yeah you have uh "
C,Task,"Thirty minutes . "
A,Task,"thirty minutes . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Then we have to uh see something which we can uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
B,Elicit,"Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? "
A,Task,"show to the management . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Shall we uh make a new uh "
A,Task,"I would yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"l let's just uh delete all these uh or "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Next . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Other,"Yeah comm I just make a new one . "
B,Task,"Oh comm next . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Oh and save this uh board . "
C,Other,"Huh ? "
A,Task,"Just save it . "
C,Other,"Yeah I'll just I'll just keep it there . "
A,Task,"Yeah okay "
A,Task,"but just press save and uh "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It'll be fine . "
D,Task,"On the left . "
D,Task,"S so comm yeah . "
C,Other,"Uh sorry . "
A,Task,"You can also include clip-art . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Current colour ? "
A,Task,"So if you'll rather draw in paint or something "
C,Minor,"So um "
B,Minor,"Okay . Uh "
C,Other,"Shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Because I I "
B,Other,"And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface . "
A,Minor,"then look . "
C,Other,"Yeah 'cause I have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . "
D,Elicit,"This ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So how it's gonna look . "
C,Task,"And you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . "
D,Task,"Uh pretty accurate . "
C,Task,"So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there comm you have to correct . "
D,Task,"Oh we skip this I guess . Sound button press . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Elicit,"Uh do you mind if I draw in black then ? For normal sketches . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You can also include it . "
A,Task,"It's not much work . "
D,Other,"Light only button user ca user interaction . "
B,Task,"Oh no it's it's okay . "
C,Task,"so we kind of want the girlish "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's included . "
A,Task,"Yeah okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction . So "
C,Minor,"figure . "
C,Task,"I'm not so good at drawing . "
C,Other,"Excuse me ? "
D,Task,"Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um comm well that they are plastic comm because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"No uh uh . "
D,Task,"Maybe you should draw it very large like this . "
B,Task,"Yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Sensitive . "
D,Task,"Oh right . "
C,Elicit,"How do we uh uh "
D,Elicit,"Erase ? "
C,Elicit,"or insert text ? "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"Maybe just start typing . "
B,Task,"It's a bit uh large . "
C,Task,"Oh that's a bit big . Yeah . "
A,Task,"You also do the other sides . "
A,Task,"Not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Ex exactly . "
B,Minor,". "
B,Other,"L let's make first the the the all the views . The the front view comm side view and the back view . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Task,"Uh I thought for the side view comm that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle comm where you're holding it with your "
A,Other,"Jesus . "
A,Elicit,"What do I write down ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Why can't I work here ? This is much easier . "
D,Task,"Much easier comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but "
C,Task,"Exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think . "
A,Task,"No "
A,Other,"so I just work here a few minutes . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah the display comm "
C,Elicit,"Uh don't you think ? "
B,Task,"we yeah we can put a display . "
C,Task,"So the display we will put in here comm the basic uh functions in here comm where it's most reachable . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"The "
B,Task,"The the arrow functions . Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"The th "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
C,Task,"Oh . This is hard . "
C,Minor,"What do "
C,Elicit,"don't have to draw it exactly do we ? "
B,Task,"No it's it's uh it's okay . "
C,Other,"Wait . "
C,Other,"Let me try it one more time . "
C,Task,"Maybe I've uh it's easier if I draw it in once . "
C,Task,"Okay comm of course it will become way more ugly . "
B,Task,"You can make it m larger . "
B,Task,"Maybe it's easier to to draw uh "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"This'll take forever . "
C,Task,"It's fun to work with this pen . "
C,Other,"Um so comm larger . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"Yeah that's that's the basic idea . Yeah . "
D,Other,"Wrong one . "
C,Minor,"And "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Other,"So side . "
A,Task,"Five minutes left before the meeting ends . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Other,"Um other views ? "
D,Task,"Alright . "
B,Task,"Yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's the question . "
D,Minor,"But we we "
C,Other,"Let's fill i fill in the buttons later . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So this is gonna be from the "
D,Elicit,"I is it if if this is from the side "
C,Minor,"uh from "
D,Other,"woah . Steady . "
B,Minor,"From the "
C,Task,"yeah yeah . "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
D,Task,"Because there the screen goes up like that right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So then it's like this comm "
D,Task,"or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the "
C,Minor,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"it's better to have it somewhat like this . "
D,Elicit,"Or does it flip all the way ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah I'm I'm "
C,Task,"The the idea is that it has to flip up to here . "
B,Task,"May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Because it do doesn't have to flip then . "
B,Task,"Because we have en enough space for for making a an L_C_D . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . "
B,Minor,"Because here "
D,Task,"It's better to to have this like this I guess comm and then flip it like this . "
C,Task,"True . "
B,Elicit,"But why why do we need uh the flipping uh "
C,Task,"you can adjust the angle to which it flips . "
C,Task,"So it can also from this angle comm it can flip all the way up to there . "
B,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
C,Task,"You can flip it up to there if you want . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So w yeah . "
D,Task,"But we still keep the flipping mechanism . "
C,Task,"Think so . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah we keep the flip ? "
A,Elicit,"Keep the flip live . "
C,Task,"Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"Uh the the shape is okay but "
B,Minor,"yeah ? "
B,Task,"I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I thought it would be cool . "
B,Minor,"Because we "
B,Task,"Okay yeah . It's it's for for for more trendy uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah but maybe Yeah but maybe we we should then "
B,Task,"Because we have enough space . "
B,Task,"H here we got uh the basic functions comm "
D,Task,"Yeah there the middle "
B,Task,"the the arrow uh yeah button . "
D,Task,"Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"and then h we sh mm . "
D,Minor,"And then like i oh th "
D,Other,"doh . "
D,Other,"Come on . "
D,Task,"So this is the shape . "
D,Task,"Oh . It hasn't "
C,Task,". It doesn't aim so well . "
D,Task,"Okay but the screen is a bit lower "
D,Task,"because if it falls on the other side comm it doesn't fall on the screen . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm then it's "
D,Task,"So there's a layer of rubber on the side . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . Definitely . "
D,Task,"So no flipping but just "
B,Elicit,"No flipping or "
A,Elicit,"No flipping ? "
D,Task,"no . "
B,Task,"you wanted the flipping so "
C,Task,"Yeah I guess "
C,Task,"but uh I mean most votes count right ? "
B,Minor,"But if you if you "
B,Task,"If you drop it it it just breaks . "
B,Task,"And it has to be very strong because of the . Yeah kind of "
D,Task,"Throwing and the kinetics . "
A,Task,"It's shaking . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Oh . We better make we better make it like this . Eventually . "
C,Task,"Yeah true true . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah just light on top . "
C,Task,"Yeah if you if you're going for the kinetics "
B,Task,"And it's also for the for the children comm it's yeah for people not sixteen years . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Safer . "
A,Task,"Mm . Yeah okay that the target group . "
D,Task,"Uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone comm so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . Yes . "
B,Minor,"But there are more "
B,Task,"Yeah okay . That's true . "
B,Task,"Okay . Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Well . I just uh ended the meeting . "
C,Task,"Yeah . I'm just thinking totally different designs also . "
A,Task,"You two go design . "
B,Minor,"Okay wi "
C,Elicit,"Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . "
A,Other,"Oh . By the way . Um "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Maybe we should try something like that . But yeah . "
A,Task,"I uh thought up a name for our product . "
D,Task,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Oh right . "
A,Task,"Yeah . It's called uh the Real Remote . "
D,Task,"Ooh . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"With a copyright sign after Real . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Alright . "
B,Minor,"The Real Remote . "
C,Task,"Yeah . I like it . "
C,Task,"Okay . This can go . "
A,Task,"So maybe you can include that somewhere . "
D,Task,"Good . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"We should work in our own room right ? Or not ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well . "
A,Task,"I don't see any power cables here so "
C,Other,"Let's see . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yes . "
C,Elicit,"What the hell's that ? "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"See you two in half an hour uh "
B,Task,"I think uh it's the sensors . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Other,"Good luck . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Okay that's the side . "
B,Task,"Ah it's it's okay . "
B,Elicit,"But do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . I think we do . "
B,Elicit,"Or just leave it ? "
B,Task,"Uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll comm volume button . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"or j or also scrolling for the m yeah . "
B,Task,"For menu . Or "
C,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
C,Task,"We w kind of wanted to stick with the "
B,Task,"Yeah . No comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah I'm just thinking comm if we i we wanna make something different "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah you are going to design it so "
