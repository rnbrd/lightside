Speaker,DialogAct,Text
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Oh "
D,Other,"I totally "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"'cause I moved it . "
D,Other,"'S put it over here . "
D,Task,"Then we don't have to worry about it . "
C,Elicit,"Ready for this ? "
A,Elicit,"All set ? "
A,Task,"Cool . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm "
A,Task,"it is PowerPoint time . "
A,Task,"I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"which is kind of fun . "
C,Other,"Oh man . "
A,Minor,"So uh "
A,Task,"here we have our detailed design meeting "
A,Task,"where we will um look at the prototype "
A,Minor,"and "
A,Minor,"um right so um comm "
A,Task,"I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my "
A,Task,"that my coach was sending to me . "
A,Task,"It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . "
B,Other,"Oh "
B,Elicit,"really ? "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I think . "
D,Other,"Huh . "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary "
A,Task,"and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes comm "
A,Minor,"s so just to go "
A,Other,"um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting comm "
A,Other,"uh comm I will open them slowly comm no ? "
A,Task,"Wait for it comm wait for it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"that's not you . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"That's how the "
A,Task,"Wait . "
A,Other,"This is comm this is very high-powered stuff here comm "
A,Other,"double-clicking comm "
A,Task,"there we go . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer comm uh or from Nathan comm and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here "
A,Task,"um and what sort of limitations we're operating with "
A,Other,"um uh excuse me "
A,Task,"what limitations we're operating under comm "
A,Task,"what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing "
A,Task,"and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition comm "
A,Task,"I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape "
A,Task,"um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote "
A,Task,"since you could just use your voice . "
A,Task,"That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation "
A,Task,"but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . "
A,Minor,"Um comm and uh the uh uh "
A,Task,"the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Task,"That's sorted comm "
A,Task,"back to the main meet here comm "
A,Task,"um comm go ahead and take it away guys . "
B,Minor,"Well . Uh comm "
B,Task,"we have assembled our prototype comm um . "
B,Elicit,"What's to be said about it ? "
B,Task,"Um comm we took into account a lot of the things "
B,Task,"that we went over in the last meeting comm um . "
B,Task,"Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen "
B,Task,"which you can see "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions comm um . "
B,Task,"This is going to be the on off button "
B,Task,"and we have these buttons to go through the channels "
B,Task,"um and then two volume buttons down here comm "
B,Task,"d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . "
B,Task,"And then comm for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here "
B,Task,"um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . "
B,Task,"But this actually can slide back in "
B,Task,"and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away comm um . "
B,Task,"As far as the uh whole visible light thing comm we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out comm "
D,Task,"Ah . "
A,Task,"Nice . "
B,Task,"why not ? "
D,Task,"Fair enough . "
B,Task,"Of course comm if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um . "
A,Task,"Perfect . "
C,Minor,"No "
B,Task,"Go ahead . "
C,Minor,"it's important to "
C,Task,"we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here "
C,Task,"um f we call it fruity "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Other,"if you will . "
D,Task,"Appropriate comm okay . "
C,Minor,"Um . Right comm um comm "
C,Task,"of course that's uh interchangeable "
C,Task,"and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued "
D,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Task,"but this is kind of something that can be done "
D,Task,"It is an option . "
C,Task,"um and as you can see on the television there "
C,Task,"uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . "
A,Other,"Oh comm right . "
B,Task,"That's this here . "
D,Other,"Ah . I see . "
C,Task,"Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . "
C,Elicit,"Um comm what other things do we see here comm well comm um "
C,Task,"if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel comm "
C,Minor,"um comm so "
C,Task,"I think that will work well with regards to our market . "
C,Minor,"Um and uh "
C,Task,"let's see comm "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . "
C,Minor,"Um uh "
C,Elicit,"do you have anything else to add to that ? "
B,Task,"Um I worried about the materials comm "
B,Minor,"it is "
B,Task,"uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating "
B,Task,"so it's very durable uh comm "
B,Task,"it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . "
B,Task,"Um comm and of course as you can see "
B,Task,"and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . "
C,Other,"It's actually important to note that the television comm uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that comm that i it actually is edible inside . "
B,Task,"Fact comm "
B,Task,"I dunno if you noticed comm "
B,Task,"but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen comm "
A,Other,"Oh "
A,Task,"well done yeah comm yeah oh ok "
D,Task,"Nice . "
B,Task,"I thought that was kinda nice . "
B,Task,"This was actually an apple on the inside . "
D,Elicit,"Do we need to worry about um rot factors ? "
B,Minor,"This "
C,Task,"Um it's encased in a new uh type of uh "
D,Other,"Oh okay comm "
D,Task,"there's preservatives involved comm "
C,Task,"polymer "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"we don't need to worry comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"It's fine . "
B,Task,"We got a bit ahead of ourselves comm "
D,Other,"okay . "
B,Task,"I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that comm but "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Fair enough . "
A,Other,"Edible televisions comm it's a wave of the future . "
D,Minor,"No but "
D,Other,"It's a couple years off at least . "
C,Task,"It's pos a possible new product . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um comm but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote comm "
C,Elicit,"um I dunno if you guys have any questions "
A,Task,"Brilliant . "
B,Task,"Right . "
C,Elicit,"or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . "
C,Elicit,"Um comm did we come in under budget ? "
B,Task,"Uh we did comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"This cost "
B,Minor,"well "
B,Minor,"to put this into um production comm we're looking at about "
B,Elicit,"what was our goal ? "
B,Task,"It was twelve fifty Euro "
B,Task,"um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . "
B,Task,"Um comm so I was quite pleased with that . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"One thing that we didn't do "
B,Task,"um obviously we had a choice with the buttons "
B,Task,"whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons comm "
B,Task,"but we just went for a classic rubber button "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"and um since we did that "
B,Task,"we didn't have to use as many microchips "
B,Task,"which was quite nice "
B,Task,"and that's what helped keep the cost down . "
A,Task,"Brilliant . "
B,Task,"So even though it has a lot of modern technology comm um for example the voice recognition comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ? "
B,Minor,"And "
B,Task,"Oh no comm we haven't talked about that yet have we ? "
C,Minor,"So uh so uh yeah "
C,Task,"on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Um comm but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . "
C,Task,"Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier "
D,Other,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Task,"and um comm I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not . "
B,Task,"Hmm . Yeah . "
C,Task,"And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um comm so . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Cool . "
B,Elicit,"Any questions ? "
A,Task,"No comm no "
A,Minor,"I think that's "
D,Elicit,"Do we have um other comm for lack of a better word comm skins ? Covers ? "
D,Elicit,"In play now "
D,Elicit,"or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? "
B,Elicit,"Um comm do you wanna answer this one "
D,Elicit,"Do we know where we stand on that yet ? "
B,Elicit,"or do you want me to answer it ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"we didn't quite have enough material uh . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"I wasn't expecting a prototype "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet . "
C,Other,"Oh I see comm "
C,Minor,"right comm um . "
B,Minor,"Um comm well "
B,Task,"as you can see this is just a most superficial layer "
B,Task,"and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Just veneer really comm "
D,Task,"yeah . Okay . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . "
D,Minor,"And the whole thing "
D,Other,"Okay "
D,Minor,"Right "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"I mean there are I "
C,Task,"we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"There's "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"which I think worked out fine . "
C,Task,"We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green . "
D,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
D,Task,"Okay comm very cool . "
B,Task,"It's not it's not quite a a face plate comm "
B,Task,"it's more like a pseudo-face plate "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"because it's simple enough "
B,Task,"that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it comm "
B,Task,"it locks into place such that comm you know comm it's pretty permanent "
B,Task,"but at the same time comm if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments "
B,Task,"and we could go the face plate way "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"if you know what I mean . "
D,Other,"Yep . "
D,Task,"It's still an option if we need it . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Very cool comm nice job . "
A,Minor,"Right comm yeah "
A,Other,"thanks guys "
A,Task,"that's very comm very good work . "
A,Task,"I like it comm "
A,Task,"brilliant . "
A,Task,"Um comm what we need to discuss now is the finance of it comm um "
A,Minor,"I got me you've got "
A,Task,"you provided a number "
A,Task,"that actually sounds quite nice . "
A,Task,"Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Um comm it's a spreadsheet of the parts "
A,Task,"and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um . "
B,Other,"Ooh . "
A,Other,"I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly comm "
A,Minor,"but it looks like "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"we'll just "
A,Task,"if we can just itemize what's in here comm "
A,Minor,"we've got this "
A,Task,"it's a solar cell thing "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"Right "
B,Task,"uh we didn't really touch on that "
A,Elicit,"With a back-up battery ? "
B,Task,"but it it's in there comm "
B,Task,"yep . "
A,Other,"With the ba okay . Um "
A,Minor,"and "
C,Task,"The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Clever comm clever comm "
A,Task,"well done . "
A,Minor,"Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um "
A,Task,"It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time "
A,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"It's just making use of the same space and the same materials comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um and the case comm it's more of a single-curved case comm "
A,Minor,"I guess would be that be the general "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"one big curve I guess you could say . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . "
A,Task,"Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down "
A,Task,"so maybe we've got two push button interfaces "
A,Elicit,"don't we ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Minor,"And um a special "
A,Task,"I guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"special . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well comm "
B,Elicit,"don't you ? "
B,Task,"'Cause it i it is very unconventional comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"it's it's quite unique . "
B,Task,"I like to think of it as unconventional . "
A,Task,"I like it comm yeah "
A,Minor,"it's "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"it looks like "
D,Task,"M come in at sixteen ? "
A,Task,"a bit over budget comm um . "
B,Other,"Oh . Huh comm "
B,Task,"doesn't match up "
B,Elicit,"does it ? "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"what we could do perhaps comm a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells "
A,Task,"um or take out the back-up battery . Uh "
B,Elicit,"How do you feel about that ? "
C,Minor,"I mean "
C,Task,"I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features comm being environmental and without the batteries and what not comm "
C,Task,"although it does still have a battery "
C,Task,"so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see "
B,Task,"and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time "
B,Task,"but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time "
B,Task,"when people are calling "
B,Task,"and saying oh look my remote isn't working "
B,Elicit,"what am I gonna do ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm k . "
B,Task,"People'd be real upset . "
B,Task,"I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery comm "
D,Task,"True . "
B,Task,"it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea "
B,Task,"'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"What's difficult comm we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now comm "
D,Minor,"Nah . "
A,Minor,"it would have to be "
A,Task,"seems like we'd have to go back to "
A,Task,"square one in a way . "
A,Task,"Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it comm um "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental "
D,Task,"I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural comm new thing comm "
D,Task,"but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget "
D,Elicit,"if I've done my math correctly . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing "
D,Minor,"I mean "
C,Task,"I mean that's what sets us apart "
D,Minor,"Which comm it's "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Task,"yeah "
D,Task,"that's what setting us into this young market comm "
D,Task,"I mean that's where we started from comm so "
D,Task,"I don't know comm "
D,Minor,"and I mean you know "
D,Task,"perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game "
D,Task,"but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . "
C,Task,"And the reality is you know comm for me from an ideological stand point comm I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell comm "
B,Minor,"Right . "
C,Other,"but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"It's either or . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and maybe move ahead with the project comm without the solar cell . "
B,Task,"Yeah . I guess we might have to do that . "
D,Task,"I think unfortunately that's our best option . "
B,Task,"It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal "
B,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
D,Task,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Of twelve fifty . "
A,Task,"'Cause we can't remove the push buttons "
A,Task,"'cause they're "
B,Task,"Yeah comm . "
D,Minor,"It kind of "
A,Minor,"um and we can't get rid of the uh I mean removing the "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"changing the case wouldn't be so much of a "
C,Task,"Savings . "
A,Task,"mm-mm comm "
A,Task,"um comm nor would changing the case materials . "
D,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
A,Minor,"Um . So yeah "
A,Task,"that looks like to be the only thing . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So that would be the "
A,Task,"it's a major change but "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Gotta do what you gotta do . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm so "
A,Task,"we're in agreement on that . "
D,Task,"Unfortunately I think we are . "
C,Minor,"No comm "
C,Task,"I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Moving along swiftly . "
A,Minor,"Um comm so "
A,Task,"I guess now we just go to the project evaluation "
A,Task,"which I will allow Sarah to take over . "
D,Task,"That would be me . "
D,Task,"Um cord ? "
A,Minor,"Ah "
A,Task,"of course comm "
A,Other,"sorry . "
D,Other,"No problem . "
A,Other,"Whoosh . "
D,Task,"Can you reach comm "
D,Task,"that would be great comm "
C,Task,"Yep . "
D,Other,"thank you . "
A,Other,"That'd be great "
D,Task,"I didn't even do that one on purpose either comm "
D,Other,"damn . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm um comm "
D,Task,"basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of "
D,Task,"these are the things we needed to do comm "
D,Task,"these are the things that look like we feel they're important . "
D,Task,"Um so I was looking at basic design things comm "
D,Elicit,"does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? "
D,Elicit,"Is the design what we wanted it to do ? "
D,Minor,"I "
D,Elicit,"are technologies up to where we hoped they would be "
D,Elicit,"and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um . "
D,Elicit,"Basic questions like comm you know comm does it turn on ? "
D,Task,"Does it respond to voice recognition ? "
D,Task,"And overall comm in general comm it looks like it's coming up to par . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm the only thing is with with the pull-out panel comm that is comm can it take some adjusting "
D,Task,"because it's a new sort of interface comm "
D,Task,"um that looked like it was coming up rough comm "
D,Task,"but then comm once you get used to it comm it does make a lot of sense . "
D,Task,"So I think overall we're headed in the right direction . "
B,Task,"Really good . "
D,Minor,"So . "
C,Task,"They like that spongy feel . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It looks like it's going over well comm so "
C,Task,"And the paging function works well comm "
B,Other,"Six ? "
C,Task,"that's good to hear comm "
D,Task,"we're we're good yeah . "
C,Task,"we worked hard on that one . "
B,Task,"We did . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"It's "
D,Task,"I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options "
D,Task,"and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff comm "
D,Task,"but for now comm what we've got is working in the range we need it for comm "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"it's all good . "
A,Task,"Brilliant . "
B,Task,"I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel "
D,Task,"That's everything from me . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"but it's okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"it is a set-back comm "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Elicit,"do you need the cord back ? "
C,Task,"W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again "
A,Task,"Um yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I was just "
A,Task,"go on . "
C,Minor,"that we're "
B,Task,"I know . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"they don't own tellys anyway "
A,Elicit,"do they ? "
C,Task,"I guess that's true . "
B,Task,"True . "
A,Minor,"Right . So comm um comm "
A,Task,"this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair comm um . "
A,Task,"I got this slide from the coach "
A,Task,"and I'm not sure what it's connected to . "
A,Task,"Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um "
A,Other,"and that is gonna go into my report . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like "
A,Task,"and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth "
A,Task,"and how that all worked comm I guess comm um . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"As in within the team or ? "
A,Task,"I think so yeah . "
B,Minor,"Right so "
B,Elicit,"it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"I think it's I "
A,Task,"mm-hmm comm I think so . "
B,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Other,"I think hope I'm not screwing up an experiment . "
D,Task,"It is now comm "
D,Task,"you're in charge "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Other,"there you go . "
A,Task,"But I trust that she would jump in if I was "
A,Minor,"so okay "
A,Task,"fair enough . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Whatever . "
A,Minor,"Um right comm um so "
A,Elicit,"any thoughts ? "
B,Elicit,"Are we considering these points here ? "
D,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I think they're starting blocks "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"What do you guys feel about the process ? "
D,Minor,"Um comm you know "
D,Task,"I think in general comm for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive comm "
D,Task,"considering the little amount of input we had going in . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um comm and the technology has definitely been a help comm "
D,Task,"it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . "
C,Task,"We didn't use the whiteboard at all . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No comm no whiteboard . "
D,Task,"No comm we didn't . "
D,Task,"We could now if that'd make up for it "
D,Task,"but really "
C,Minor,"And "
D,Task,"and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed "
D,Task,"but because of room constraints comm doesn't really matter . "
C,Task,"Um comm also had I not been intrigued about the pen comm I don't think I woulda used it at all comm "
C,Task,"I didn't write barely anything . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"I think I was taking notes more often than usual "
D,Task,"just 'cause I liked the pen comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's true . "
C,Other,"Uh . "
B,Other,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Was pretty cool tack though . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Definitely . "
D,Task,"I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach . "
B,Elicit,"As you write your personal coach . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but I didn't get a response "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Other,"we'll see . "
B,Other,"What if you get a response two or three months from now ? "
D,Minor,"Okay "
B,Task,"That'd be weird . "
D,Task,"that would be kinda creepy . "
A,Task,"Attempts to contact coach ineffective . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"what kind of coaching is that really ? "
D,Elicit,"What if I really needed something . "
C,Minor,"I so "
C,Minor,"I don't "
C,Task,"n I think there was a lot of room for creativity comm "
C,Task,"we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us comm um . "
D,Task,"I think so . "
D,Task,"And even then we did get a decent product turned out "
D,Task,"although it's not everything we wanted it to be . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"With the natural look . "
B,Other,"That's very natural . "
A,Other,"Very natural look . "
D,Other,"Organic comm really . "
A,Other,"That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here . "
D,Other,"And highly resourceful team mates might I add "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"which is always a plus . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think comm yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually comm I mean . "
D,Task,"Mm yeah comm "
C,Task,"I think the teamwork was good as well . "
D,Task,"I'm impressed . "
B,Task,"And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh comm "
B,Task,"we used every bit . "
D,Task,"Nice . "
D,Other,"All four of those little containers . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . "
B,Minor,"I guess "
B,Task,"My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with comm "
B,Task,"we only had four comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"wasn't enough . "
D,Task,"You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . "
B,Task,"I know "
B,Task,"it could have been amazing . "
D,Other,"Oh well . "
A,Elicit,"What did you guys think about the the the roles ? "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"They were good . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"it's f kind of fun comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"it was "
B,Task,"I think it was pretty clever "
B,Task,"'cause we were never able to get too far off track "
B,Task,"because the information came in at the right time "
B,Task,"and kind of filled in the gaps enough . "
D,Task,"True . "
B,Task,"At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up comm "
D,Task,"Do your own . "
B,Task,"which was kind of fun . "
D,Task,"Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I mean maybe it's just me "
D,Task,"but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . "
A,Task,"That's true comm "
D,Task,"Nothing comm I didn't even get an email comm "
A,Task,"I I got this spreadsheet . "
D,Minor,"like "
D,Task,"that was it . "
D,Minor,"So comm yeah comm "
D,Other,"I feel like that was slightly lacking "
D,Task,"but then you know comm fill in the blanks on your own comm level of creativity upped . "
C,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"Whatever . "
C,Task,"I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to "
A,Task,"Of what to do . "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"no "
C,Minor,"but also "
C,Minor,"yeah "
C,Task,"when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh comm "
D,Task,"that wasn't very much . "
B,Minor,"You know "
C,Task,"um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"because that was kind of the interface portion "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"which was what the whole project was about "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Mm comm mm . "
C,Minor,"uh "
D,Task,"Hmm comm "
D,Task,"very much so . "
C,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That was fun . "
C,Task,"which was fine . "
B,Task,"I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . "
B,Task,"'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . "
D,Task,"Very much so . "
A,Task,"Cool . "
C,Task,"And I think your leadership was quite good . "
B,Task,"It was really good yeah . "
D,Task,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"She said I I I "
A,Task,"she actually made a comment off "
A,Task,"boy you're getting into this "
A,Task,"and I really I think it's true "
A,Task,"I did get I I felt like I got way too into it . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That's kind of a good thing though comm "
A,Task,"I felt like I slipped into it a lot . "
B,Task,"It's kinda fun . "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Task,"give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
C,Minor,"An "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Elicit,"is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ? "
A,Task,"The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . "
A,Task,"I usually organise crap comm "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"it's one thing to do comm you know set up a party with your friends comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"you know ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Little different . "
A,Elicit,"But you guys felt that you could keep the comm yeah comm suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I "
D,Task,"except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand "
D,Task,"and I knew we were all lying through our teeth comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"other than that "
C,Task,"I had to admit comm as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh comm th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . "
D,Other,"I could only imagine . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too comm "
C,Task,"Possibly . "
A,Task,"like make a remote control or spaceship comm "
A,Task,"we used to have spaceship Legos "
A,Elicit,"did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos "
C,Task,"Oh yeah comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . Totally . "
C,Task,"still have 'em . "
A,Task,"everybody knows best spaceships ever . "
A,Elicit,"Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? "
B,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"I think so . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"You don't . "
A,Task,"No I comm no I dunno comm I d I I dunno comm "
A,Minor,"I don't I I was just I "
D,Minor,"Though we didn't actually "
D,Task,"I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming comm use the board "
A,Task,"It's true huh ? "
D,Minor,"well "
D,Task,"and this would have been six months' worth of work comm not like three hours' worth of meetings . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I mean "
C,Task,"I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That's true . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like comm kind of like comm like hmm . "
A,Minor,"It d "
D,Task,"Yeah that is kind of "
A,Minor,"But yeah . "
A,Task,"Interesting . It's kind of fascinating "
A,Elicit,"wasn't it ? "
A,Task,"I mean the whole process of "
B,Minor,"Wonder why "
B,Elicit,"is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"I I don't know if there was a ri I th "
D,Task,"Mine was the mics . "
D,Task,"I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's it "
D,Task,"I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . "
B,Task,"'cause the mics are loose "
B,Task,"and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I dunno what I woulda shown on that board . "
D,Task,"True comm "
D,Task,"but it didn't even occur to me as an option comm "
D,Task,"I mean I don't know that I would have "
A,Task,"Nor I . "
D,Task,"but I know that I consciously didn't . "
C,Minor,"I mean "
C,Task,"it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . "
D,Task,"True . "
C,Task,"Um comm because I've got this laptop . Standard comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I just used it "
C,Task,"'cause it's literally right in front of me . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I wanna see the output files from these um comm from the digital paper . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"it looks really professional . "
A,Task,"I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized "
D,Task,"I know . "
A,Task,"because my handwriting is crap . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I mean comm "
B,Task,"that's it . "
A,Task,"just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . "
B,Task,"Usually I would do a lot more doodling too "
B,Task,"but I didn't "
B,Minor,"because "
D,Task,"I know comm "
D,Task,"I felt like I needed to be professional "
D,Task,"so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm well "
D,Task,"not entirely comm "
D,Task,"but still comm I doodled less than I usually do . "
A,Minor,"T "
A,Task,"I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . "
A,Minor,"You know comm like "
A,Minor,"what is the uh "
A,Elicit,"what exactly we're looking for here . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"is this all we need to get through ? "
A,Task,"I dunno comm "
A,Task,"I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . "
D,Task,"I guess . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
B,Elicit,"New ideas . "
D,Elicit,"It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? "
C,Minor,"Is it "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file "
A,Task,"but this slide was just there comm "
D,Elicit,"That slide was like that ? "
A,Task,"mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I didn't change this one at all . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Well . "
A,Minor,"Um ch "
B,Task,"I guess we're on the right track . "
A,Task,"Yeah well . "
C,Elicit,"Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? "
A,Minor,"W I kinda like th "
B,Task,"No comm none . "
D,Task,"Uh I think they still do their job . "
B,Task,"I think they're fine actually . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"you can't "
D,Task,"I am thinking outside the little square box though comm with literally in like form "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I don't "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"maybe a s a circle would be alright comm different . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Does kinda make you wonder comm "
A,Minor,"I mean comm "
A,Elicit,"how much can you do with a remote control ? "
A,Task,"It's like inventing a new car . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah comm "
D,Task,"It's still gotta be technically car shaped "
A,Minor,"you can "
D,Task,"or it won't fit on the road comm "
D,Elicit,"you know ? "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Don't know . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um . 'Kay . "
C,Elicit,"What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ? "
D,Task,"Kind of . "
A,Task,"So this was other costs . "
B,Elicit,"Are we back into project mood ? "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Minor,"I think this is "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Elicit,"how long was our meeting supposed to be ? "
D,Elicit,"How much time do we have left ? "
A,Task,"forty ish "
A,Task,"I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval comm um . "
A,Task,"I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . "
A,Minor,"Like comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"what like you know what am I really doing comm "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Minor,"what is "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"at the beginning it started out "
D,Task,"and I felt actually like under pressure "
D,Task,"like the first couple were taking a lot of work "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation "
D,Task,"that you guys don't really care about anyway "
C,Elicit,"Why ? "
D,Task,"so type away . "
A,Task,"Hey . "
C,Other,"Huh "
D,Task,"You know comm you know what I mean "
C,Task,"I think it was the real . "
D,Task,"like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and then by the time I got to the last one I was like comm you know comm not very much . "
D,Task,"Whatever . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Very much comm yeah . "
C,Task,"which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning . "
A,Task,"I actually didn't do that at all though comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides "
A,Task,"or edited 'em . "
A,Minor,"I di "
C,Minor,"Oh "
C,Task,"I added like five slides too comm "
A,Other,"Oh . "
D,Minor,"See "
D,Task,"I only got blank ones . "
B,Elicit,"Did you really ? "
C,Minor,"but I "
B,Task,"I just got blank ones "
B,Minor,"and "
A,Other,"What ? "
A,Elicit,"Really ? "
D,Task,"My slides were all blank comm "
D,Task,"they'd have a title maybe "
C,Task,"Yeah comm mine too . "
D,Task,"and they were just empty . "
B,Task,"Me too . "
A,Minor,"Did they not have they didn't like uh mine "
A,Minor,"yeah "
A,Elicit,"they didn't come like this ? "
A,Minor,"Like with "
A,Task,"this was what it looks like . "
D,Elicit,"Like with those words already on it ? "
A,Task,"This is what that looked like comm "
A,Task,"literally comm just like that . "
D,Other,"No . "
C,Other,"No . "
A,Task,"Interesting . "
D,Task,"I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated . "
A,Other,"Uh-huh huh huh . "
B,Task,"I deleted slides . "
D,Task,"I think I added a slide one time . "
C,Task,"I added many slides every time "
D,Minor,"Hey "
D,Task,"with the whole new background being innovative comm yeah that was class . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That was pretty cool comm "
B,Task,"it was a high moment of the whole experiment . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Other,"Um . "
A,Task,"Interesting . "
A,Elicit,"Any other thoughts come to mind ? "
D,Elicit,"I wanna know how our product would fare . "
D,Task,"I can't just leave it there . "
B,Task,"I think it would fail comm I think "
B,Task,"it'd be a huge disaster comm especially if it looks like that . "
D,Task,"I think it would take extensive marketing comm "
D,Task,"okay comm "
D,Task,"an apple with a red button on top comm even I am sceptical . "
D,Minor,"But you know the whole "
C,Task,"Even you . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"I don't "
B,Task,"we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face . "
D,Other,"I know it is . "
A,Minor,"Yeah but "
B,Task,"It's a happy face . "
C,Task,"Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Builds . "
A,Other,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar "
D,Task,"I I noticed that . By accident . "
C,Task,"that happened to be consumed . "
A,Task,"Interesting . "
D,Minor,"Well huh . "
D,Task,"An interesting day all in all I would say . "
A,Task,"Uh comm yeah comm I'd say so . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"it's uh "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"again I reiterate my question "
C,Elicit,"of how different we are comp compared to the other groups comm especially between culture groups and what not . "
D,Elicit,"I know . "
A,Elicit,"Mm comm I know . "
C,Other,"Mm . "
A,Task,"It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the the the basics to the conce "
B,Minor,"I wanna see a "
D,Minor,"I "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"although the whole concepts thing comm the whole concepts phase comm I don't think I really understood like the concept . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"the id "
A,Minor,"okay "
D,Task,"'Cause it's such a functional item . "
A,Minor,"the notion of "
A,Minor,"yeah I mean "
A,Task,"i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material comm "
A,Task,"it's just it is what it is . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"You know comm "
A,Minor,"maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of "
A,Task,"rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of "
A,Task,"proposed idea . "
A,Task,"And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Minor,"But . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"All in all it's kinda interesting . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"we have more slides or ? "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"just this closing one . "
A,Minor,"No "
A,Task,"we've established that the costs weren't really within budget comm "
A,Task,"but we could s you know do it "
D,Task,"We got it to be . "
A,Task,"We did the project evaluation based on um Sarah's evaluation of on off switches "
D,Task,"Like cutting corners . "
D,Task,"Kind of comm "
D,Task,"though it was really technically an evaluation of the product comm not the project in general . "
A,Minor,"and "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Which I'm not sure is the same thing comm "
A,Task,"True . "
D,Task,"at the time that just i made more sense comm "
D,Task,"but I could see if they were really asking about us . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And it's all recorded comm "
A,Other,"woo-hoo . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Other,"Yay . "
A,Minor,"what I'm gonna I'm gonna put um "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end "
A,Other,"so I'll put all that into the final report as well comm or as much as seems like "
A,Other,"maybe not like the articles and stuff comm like because and if and so forth comm but I'll put most of it in the reports . "
B,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording . "
D,Task,"Make it sound eloquent . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Minor,"I have to done I've "
D,Task,"I've done transcription before "
A,Other,"Nice . "
D,Task,"and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that "
A,Task,"Oh yeah . "
D,Task,"that mean nothing . "
A,Task,"There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that comm psycholinguistics . "
C,Elicit,"What the uhs and the "
B,Other,"Really . "
D,Task,"There's a guy studying it here comm yeah comm he's studying ums and ahs or something . "
B,Elicit,"Filler words or ? "
A,Task,"Yep comm "
A,Task,"they're called um disfluencies . "
B,Other,"Disfluencies . "
D,Task,"That's a good word for it . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things . "
D,Task,"Just add some prefixes comm "
D,Task,"sounds classier . "
A,Task,"Exactly "
A,Other,"uh I will save this into the project documents . "
B,Task,"I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot comm just out of boredom comm "
D,Minor,"I comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Oh yeah . Yeah I know . "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"pretty compulsively during meetings comm like comm yeah . "
B,Task,"like c come on gimme something . "
A,Task,"Come on give me some information . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"so I mean I do the "
D,Task,"we are addicts . "
C,Task,"That's scary "
C,Elicit,"yeah ? "
B,Task,"It is scary . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"just around that eight or or nine people that are "
A,Task,"I know comm "
A,Task,"imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . "
A,Task,"It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I mean comm you know comm "
A,Task,"it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time . "
D,Minor,"I yeah . "
C,Task,"Dude comm I think we've had internet for like eighteen years . "
D,Task,"True . "
A,Minor,"No "
A,Task,"we have but I not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous "
D,Minor,"I yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But it's not regular "
D,Task,"I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties "
D,Task,"and I got it in ninety four comm "
D,Task,"but still . "
B,Task,"It's crazy . So "
D,Other,"Uh-huh . "
C,Other,"In the eighties ? "
D,Task,"My um grammy does computer science back in the States "
D,Task,"and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"There's basically the fundamental structures comm "
D,Task,"but it wasn't uh household to household yet "
C,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"because it hadn't been "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it was to the like seven universities or something . "
D,Task,"partitioned off and stuff comm "
D,Task,"yeah "
D,Task,"that was him . "
C,Elicit,"You guys ready to celebrate ? "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"that's our last step . Celebration . "
D,Elicit,"Apparently comm does that include like champagne or something exciting ? "
B,Task,"Should . "
D,Task,"I think so . "
A,Minor,"'Kay "
A,Task,"I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . "
D,Task,"I think that's a closer . "
A,Task,"Cool . "
B,Elicit,"Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? "
B,Task,"this has been long enough . "
C,Task,"Celebrate . "
A,Elicit,"Where do you find that ? "
D,Task,"I have no idea . "
B,Elicit,"Is that the only song you have ? "
C,Task,"There is another one . "
A,Elicit,"Is this one of those media player ? "
C,Other,"Huh ? "
C,Task,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"W "
A,Minor,"oh . "
B,Task,"That's awesome . "
A,Task,"The default track . "
B,Task,"Maybe I have a different one . "
A,Task,"I thought it was David Burns comm look into the eyeball . "
A,Task,"That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while comm "
A,Task,"maybe this is the new version . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"is that a close ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I guess we'll call that a a doner . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"that's the end of the meeting . "
A,Task,"Fab . "
D,Other,"Thank you gentlemen . "
D,Task,"I feel like I'm signing off . "
