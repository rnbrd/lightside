A,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Other,"Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Let's see . "
A,Task,"Our agenda . "
A,Task,"Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . "
A,Task,"Um and I think looks like we've come up with some ideas . "
A,Task,"Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . "
A,Task,"Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs "
A,Task,"so we'll take a look at that . "
A,Task,"Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . "
A,Minor,"Um so actually I think "
A,Minor,"Yeah um f "
A,Task,"you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of "
B,Other,"Okay "
B,Minor,"well um . "
B,Task,"So our design looks something like this . "
B,Task,"This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . "
B,Task,"This is a button comm serves as the power button if you hold it down comm and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . "
B,Task,"And uh the base of the remote control comm which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel comm is interchangeable . "
B,Task,"So you can change the colour comm according to your to suit your living room or whatever . "
B,Minor,"And it comes "
C,Task,"You could change the vegetable comm or fruit . "
B,Task,"yeah comm I can change the vegetable . "
A,Elicit,"Oh is that broccoli ? "
B,Task,"This one's broccoli . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . "
B,Task,"This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . "
B,Task,"This is a mango . "
B,Minor,"The "
B,Task,"it's trendy fruit comm it's not just ordinary fruits . "
B,Task,"You don't have orange comm you have mango . "
B,Task,"Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy comm but "
A,Task,"'S a very bright strawberry . "
B,Other,"So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . "
C,Minor,"It's been a l "
B,Task,"And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them comm because they'll need to switch 'em out . "
C,Task,"It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable comm "
C,Task,"and that the user can use it comm you know comm it's not too big . "
C,Task,"Uh but we think that this you know comm this size will be okay "
C,Task,"and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
C,Task,"And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually comm would be the um thing the locator . "
C,Minor,"How how so "
B,Task,"Well the locator is just chip that's inside there . "
C,Task,"Okay "
C,Minor,"so that's just "
B,Task,"And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere "
C,Task,"So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"we didn't design that . "
C,Task,"Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed . "
B,Task,"But it would be coordinating with that of course . "
C,Task,"Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"You could have a broccoli comm or you could have a mango . "
C,Other,"So . Tada . "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder comm there's an Excel spreadsheet . "
A,Task,"Um the only one that's in there comm production costs . "
A,Task,"And if you open it up . "
A,Task,"Um I've just stuck the numbers in comm "
A,Other,"it was a real challenge there . "
A,Task,"But if I missed anything that we've gone over comm or if you see something that has changed "
A,Task,"I mean comm we decided on batteries comm "
A,Task,"and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"I said uncurved or flat . "
A,Task,"I think that's what you have there comm "
A,Elicit,"is that right ? "
A,Task,"For the for the plastic part would be "
B,Task,"My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes . "
B,Task,"But it's really not very clear comm "
A,Task,"Oh . Okay . "
B,Task,"because you got single curve and double curve and d I dunno what that means . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"One side is curved and then the other side is curved . "
A,Minor,"Well yeah . "
A,Task,"If we're talking about the area just "
A,Minor,"oh I d "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . "
A,Other,"Um so what else ? "
A,Task,"There's plastic for that area around the button . "
A,Elicit,"Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ? "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um and lots of special colours actually . "
A,Task,"Uh scroll wheel . "
A,Elicit,"Do you see anything that I've missed ? "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"I think that's alright . "
A,Task,"Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine comm "
A,Task,"which is even less than twelve point five comm which means we'd be making even more of a profit . "
A,Task,"And if we sold a lot of squishy things . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Boo yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"S "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"Did y what did you work on ? "
A,Minor,"The "
D,Task,"Um evaluation criteria . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Do you wanna "
D,Other,"I've got a presentation . "
A,Minor,"Okay . I think that's "
D,Other,"So I need where's the cable ? "
D,Task,"Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"This doesn't "
D,Minor,"okay . "
D,Task,"Um the method is we well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . "
D,Task,"And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way comm feel in a certain way comm "
D,Task,"and this is everything's listed down . "
D,Task,"Um comm look in a certain way comm feel in a certain way comm it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . "
D,Task,"These are all things we looked at at the start comm "
D,Task,"um and criteria that have to be met . "
D,Task,"We have to use a table comm "
D,Other,"I'll show you that later comm "
D,Task,"together to decide whether it meets the standards . "
D,Task,"And we we have therefore in total um We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . "
D,Task,"And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . "
D,Other,"I would like to show you the table we have to use . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
D,Other,"No . "
D,Task,"This is the table . "
D,Elicit,"Can you see this here ? "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um so the que the questions I've given you c could you write that down ? "
D,Task,"True is one and and false is seven . "
D,Task,"And we'll just go through each point together comm hopefully . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . "
D,Task,"I dunno how it works exactly comm I haven't been told . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own "
D,Task,"Yeah it's in the um it's in the project documents . "
C,Elicit,"Is it meeting three minutes ? "
C,Task,"No it's not minutes . "
D,Task,"It's called evaluation criteria . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And it's under evaluation . "
A,Elicit,"Huh comm the PowerPoint one ? "
B,Other,"Hmm ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . Cool . "
D,Elicit,"You've found it all ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So it was um "
D,Task,"Yeah true's one . "
C,Other,"True's one and false is seven . "
D,Elicit,"Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ? "
A,Task,"Um we can do it separately and then discuss it "
D,Task,"Yeah okay . "
A,Elicit,"if if that's what people wanna do . "
C,Task,"So it's actually a scale . "
A,Minor,"Wait comm one is true and "
D,Minor,"Um comm "
A,Elicit,"so these are the questions we're answering . "
D,Task,"yes "
A,Elicit,"And one is "
D,Task,"it's if it's fancy you put one comm "
A,Task,"One comm right okay . "
D,Task,"if it's really unfancy it's seven . "
A,Task,"If it's somewhere in between you put four . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm something . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Does it feel fancy ? "
B,Other,"Feels like play-dough . "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"They shouldn't really be questions . "
D,Minor,"Should be more like "
D,Elicit,"Are the batteries easy to insert ? "
B,Task,"I'm gonna say yes . "
D,Task,"Yes ? Very very true . Okay . "
B,Task,"I imagine they're somewhere on the front . "
B,Task,"We have a little case that you slip 'em in . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Are we just about ready ? "
D,Task,"Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . "
D,Minor,"Do we "
D,Elicit,"um is it necessary ? "
A,Task,"I don't think so . "
A,Minor,"It's "
D,Minor,"We'll just do um "
A,Task,"yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we "
C,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
A,Other,"Our animals will forever be there . "
A,Task,"Un unless you feel you need it t to "
D,Task,"I don't feel any "
A,Task,"okay okay . "
A,Minor,"We'll "
D,Minor,"right um "
D,Elicit,"Right so one point one ? "
D,Task,"We'll just go in a circle . "
C,Task,"One . "
B,Minor,"'Kay "
B,Task,"Five . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Other,"Ooh I don't know . "
D,Other,"Right . One ? "
B,Task,"Five . "
A,Task,"Five . "
D,Other,"Five . "
D,Task,"Two . "
D,Elicit,"Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? "
D,Elicit,"Is that what the company does ? "
A,Minor,"I I think we should "
B,Task,"It's four if you wanna do that . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"It adds to sixteen comm so that's four . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Oh no . It adds to thirteen . One five five two . "
B,Task,"Oh I thought she said five . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"One five five two is thirteen comm over four for now . "
D,Minor,"I think that's um "
D,Elicit,"next ? "
C,Task,"Um three . "
B,Task,"Six . "
A,Task,"Six . "
D,Elicit,"Really ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Two . "
A,Other,"I wasn't cheating I swear . "
D,Other,"Uh-oh . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"One point three is "
C,Elicit,"So it's a one was true and seven was false ? "
B,Other,"Huh ? "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Okay comm so you guys really didn't like it ? "
D,Minor,"I really "
A,Task,"Oh I thought it was the other way round . "
B,Other,"Wait a minute . "
B,Task,"I thought it was the other way round too . "
D,Minor,"Well uh "
A,Task,"So we do have about the same thing comm we just have it the other way "
B,Minor,"Sh "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"I I was thinking one means no points comm you know comm all the way up to the top . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"It was one is true and false is seven . "
D,Task,"I should've kept the table up . "
A,Task,"Oh gosh . Okay . Well "
B,Other,"I'll just I'll just reverse them all . "
B,Task,"It's no problem . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Right comm well I'm glad this came out . "
C,Task,"I was like comm why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I thought you guys hated it . "
D,Minor,"No . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Oh that's quite funny . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Okay . So comm starting again comm one point one ? "
C,Task,"One . "
B,Task,"Say two . "
A,Task,"Three . "
D,Task,"Two . "
D,Elicit,"Okay comm one point two ? "
C,Task,"Uh three . "
B,Task,"Two . "
A,Task,"Two . "
D,Task,"Two . "
D,Elicit,"Okay . Um comm one point three ? "
C,Task,"One . "
A,Task,"One . "
B,Task,"One . "
D,Other,"Ha . "
D,Elicit,"Two point one ? "
C,Task,"Uh two . "
A,Task,"Two . "
B,Task,"Uh two . "
A,Task,"Two point I think I missed two . "
A,Elicit,"Wait comm is that two point one ? "
B,Task,"Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"One point four comm one point five . Okay right "
D,Task,"Oh dear comm "
D,Other,"okay . Sorry . "
A,Task,"that's I have two of them . "
B,Task,"Mine has all kinds of problems . "
D,Other,"Two and one . "
D,Other,"Sorry about that . "
D,Elicit,"T two point two comm which is one point five . "
A,Task,"One . "
B,Task,"Uh three . "
B,Other,"Wait why did I put three ? "
C,Task,"Uh one . "
B,Task,"I meant one on mine too . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Three point one . "
D,Elicit,"Is that correct on my slide ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Uh one . "
B,Other,"Three point one . "
B,Task,"I have four . "
A,Task,"Three . "
D,Task,"One comm four comm three comm three comm "
D,Elicit,"three point two ? "
B,Task,"Three . "
A,Task,"Three . "
C,Task,"Uh . One . "
D,Elicit,"Three point three . "
C,Task,"One . "
B,Task,"One . "
A,Task,"Two . "
D,Elicit,"Four point one ? "
C,Task,"One . "
B,Task,"Two . "
A,Task,"Five . "
D,Task,"Two . "
D,Elicit,"Four point two . "
C,Task,"Two . "
B,Task,"Three . "
A,Task,"Four . "
D,Task,"Two "
D,Elicit,"and four point three . "
B,Task,"Two . "
D,Other,"One comm two . "
C,Task,"One . "
A,Task,"Two . "
D,Task,"Right so I put one on that . "
D,Other,"Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now "
D,Task,"if you want to continue . "
A,Task,"Okay . Um "
D,Elicit,"Or is it tedious ? "
D,Other,"I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone . "
A,Task,"No no that's um "
D,Task,"I didn't know how else to do it . "
A,Task,"I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four comm where um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Well the worst ones were three point one . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Do "
D,Elicit,"does every ones have the slide ? "
D,Task,"Three point one . "
A,Minor,"The "
A,Task,"that was material . "
D,Other,"Slide show . "
D,Task,"Material technologically innovative comm "
D,Minor,"okay . Um comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"do you want to change it ? "
D,Elicit,"What are the suggestions ? "
D,Task,"I don't know comm "
D,Elicit,"anyone ? "
A,Minor,"Um "
C,Elicit,"Which one is that again sorry ? "
C,Elicit,"Three point one ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah that it's three point one was not that good . "
D,Task,"Four point one . "
A,Task,"Does the shape "
D,Task,"The shape . "
C,Minor,"I think "
D,Elicit,"Four point two ? "
A,Task,"See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining "
A,Minor,"the "
A,Elicit,"is it uh gonna be the size comm like the the controller ? "
A,Minor,"It "
B,Minor,"I think the wheel would probably be mm . "
A,Elicit,"or bigger ? "
A,Minor,"Because "
C,Task,"What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? "
C,Task,"And like then it you could hold it in your hand better . "
B,Task,"I think the base would definitely be larger comm "
B,Task,"'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . "
B,Task,"They're kinda smallish . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No but I imagine even if it was bigger comm like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of "
C,Task,"The flat one . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um but I don't s "
A,Task,"I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there comm like it's an awkward position . "
C,Minor,"I didn't "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat "
B,Task,"Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . "
C,Task,"But it's still too big I think comm in your hand . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And would it even resemble fruit that way ? "
A,Minor,"I mean "
C,Task,"Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"like you could probably do a strawberry still . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think the broccoli would be out . "
C,Minor,"You could do comm "
C,Task,"although the broccoli is quite comfortable comm I have to say comm "
C,Task,"like sorta like a joystick . "
A,Task,"Yeah that I I when you were holding that before comm it actually looked yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . That looked really good . "
C,Minor,"I don't know . So "
D,Elicit,"Are there any fruits that look like broccoli comm no ? "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"Not that I can think of . "
B,Task,"Rhubarb . "
C,Other,"Rhubarb . "
C,Task,"These obscure fruits . "
D,Task,"I think that broccoli is my favourite actually . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Uh despite the "
C,Minor,"I think we needn't "
A,Task,"What if um the it was just patterns on like "
A,Task,"we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber . "
C,Other,"Huh ? "
A,Task,"You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah . "
C,Other,"Oh okay . "
B,Task,"So it's just colour comm and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry . "
C,Task,"Yeah . That could work . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Or I mean we could even have fruit like around "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I mean "
C,Task,"Yeah . I dunno . "
A,Minor,"But if we if we need "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"and just have the colour match or something . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow comm "
A,Minor,"there might be "
A,Task,"I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the "
C,Task,"Yeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Or like "
C,Minor,"I dunno comm "
C,Minor,"some of 'em you can kind of think see as like "
C,Task,"like you could if it was only this you know comm if it was shaped like that comm and it just had that . "
C,Task,"But you see the problem is you have to attach that comm and this has to be detachable . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So like maybe that's just too big "
A,Task,"Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that comm "
C,Minor,"because "
C,Task,"Yeah it's sorta like a joystick . "
A,Minor,"which is a nice kind of "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
C,Minor,"I guess "
A,Elicit,"I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ? "
A,Minor,"'Cause like kind of "
B,Task,"We could make it that shape but just have different colours comm and call 'em the different fruits . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Or like even "
C,Minor,"Dif "
B,Task,"We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough . "
A,Task,"Or even like Yeah like you said comm like a joystick like that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"You know ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Like uh we could do "
C,Task,"I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped . "
A,Minor,"'Cause that comm I think "
A,Task,"I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And you still have the comfort of holding it like that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And you could like if it's like this comm you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"But I mean it "
A,Elicit,"do we have any other ideas about that ? "
D,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"We could tr "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"Think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one . . "
D,Task,"Batteries easy to insert for some reason comm "
D,Minor,"which can be easily "
D,Task,"I think that's not a problem any more . "
A,Elicit,"The batteries are going in the back ? "
B,Minor,"That "
B,Task,"everyone gave that a one or a two . "
B,Task,"Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one "
A,Task,"I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip "
B,Task,"No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door comm "
A,Minor,"no you could "
A,Elicit,"Just like any other one . "
B,Task,"yeah um like on a normal remote . "
A,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"So it would probably either in the f "
B,Task,"no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there comm "
B,Task,"but it'd be on one of the sides probably . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I think everyone's under three anyway . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"So I think it's "
D,Task,"yeah those are the only two points . "
C,Task,"Cool . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"Yeah the broccoli I guess wins . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape . "
B,Task,"Um comm I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"We were a bit off task . "
C,Minor,"Um so uh I can't think of any "
C,Minor,"So we'll have to like "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah I dunno . "
C,Task,"You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes comm "
C,Task,"but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like comm "
C,Minor,"but you could do like "
B,Task,"It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape . "
C,Task,"Yeah that's true . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And it would probably cost more to produce comm 'cause they're irregular . "
C,Task,"Yeah that's true . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Not really "
A,Task,"Well we've done finance evaluation criteria comm production evaluation . "
A,Task,"Um so project evaluation . "
D,Elicit,"Do you want this and we can all "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied "
A,Task,"oh comm oh it's alright . "
A,Task,"Uh . Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"It's alright yeah ? "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of "
B,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I did . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I mean fruit and squishiness . How c more creative can you get ? "
B,Task,"Sponginess . "
C,Task,"The prototype making was very creatively stimulating "
C,Task,"and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria . "
A,Elicit,"And how was our leadership and teamwork ? "
B,Task,"I think it was good . "
B,Task,"We knew what we were doing . "
B,Task,"It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . "
A,Task,"Well I thought my leadership was crap personally . "
A,Other,"Excuse me comm "
B,Task,"Well you told us when to start and when to end comm and that's all that matters . "
A,Elicit,"am I allowed to say that ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"I think you were fine . "
C,Task,"You did a good job leading . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm well I'm never gonna do a management position comm I know that now . "
A,Task,"Um yeah comm I thought we all worked very well together . "
D,Task,"Yeah we didn't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much comm as we just would be like I don't know comm all had ideas about it but "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Very democratic . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"No spats comm that was good . "
C,Minor,"No . "
A,Elicit,"Um and the means for like the materials we used comm how convenient were they ? "
A,Task,"Like the the pens comm the whiteboard comm "
A,Minor,"I mean we used "
B,Task,"Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft comm PowerPoint or any of this stuff . "
A,Elicit,"Are you a Mac person ? "
B,Task,"No no I never touch Macs either . "
B,Task,"I just use the Unix or the off market comm sort of WordPerfect and all these other things . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Which isn't very user-friendly though . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . "
B,Task,"So I have all these documents I can't use now . "
B,Task,"But yeah I mean I guess it's okay . "
C,Minor,"I felt like my "
C,Task,"I dunno if it was just my role comm "
C,Task,"but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like "
C,Task,"or maybe it was just the idea that we had . "
C,Minor,"But there's kinda "
C,Task,"it was kinda like okay comm I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So I didn't really think it was helpful . "
C,Task,"So I kind of just made up my own stuff "
C,Task,"and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead . "
C,Task,"But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally comm think it's kinda stupid . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I never use it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah but uh "
A,Task,"I can't say I found everything particularly helpful . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Like I "
C,Minor,"It didn't really "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"It "
D,Task,"I though it was brilliant no ? "
B,Task,"My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works . "
A,Elicit,"Really ? "
D,Task,"No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think . "
C,Minor,"So like a f "
A,Minor,"I mean m my problem "
D,Task,"I think it depends on the role "
D,Elicit,"no ? "
C,Task,"Yeah I think so . "
A,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah it probably does . "
A,Task,"'Cause my problem was comm you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"See I couldn't do that comm so I didn't really know what you guys were doing . "
A,Task,"And when you were talking about it I was just like "
A,Task,"you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things comm "
A,Minor,"'cause I "
B,Task,"Yeah well mine was mostly made up "
B,Task,"except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"As if you'd wanted to . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um "
A,Task,"System . "
D,Task,"a whole system comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the "
C,Minor,"Yeah I mean comm it "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well I think it's interesting how it all went together comm "
B,Task,"like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap comm "
B,Task,"and you have how people want it to be spongy comm and "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"huh . "
B,Task,"It seems planned you know . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah I kinda thought that um "
C,Task,"I felt like I would go and like try to use my information comm "
C,Task,"or like I'd make this stupid little presentation "
C,Task,"and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated "
C,Minor,"because "
C,Minor,"I dunno "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I felt like I was off-task all the time . "
C,Minor,"But um "
A,Task,"Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit "
A,Minor,"like it wasn't necessarily what was like "
A,Task,"we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ? "
D,Minor,"No . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So it's "
B,Task,"If I hadn't been told that fruit was "
D,Task,"But I think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing . "
A,Task,"Oh right . "
A,Elicit,"given certain information or "
D,Task,"Yeah comm like if everyone's given the same input "
A,Minor,"Just "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't have a clue comm anyway . "
A,Minor,"Mm comm mm . "
D,Elicit,"Um what's next ? "
D,Minor,"Looks like "
D,Task,"oh no that's not um "
D,Minor,"It's quite "
A,Elicit,"What do you guys think of the pens ? "
A,Task,"It asks about that . "
B,Task,"They're pretty cool . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"They're kinda hard to write with though . "
C,Minor,"I wanna s "
A,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and I I've f forgotten once or twice to check the box . "
C,Task,"I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the "
B,Task,"They're nicer than the pen that I'm using comm "
B,Task,"because like your stuff actually shows up here comm rather than having to look at the screen and write . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"But even so comm I dunno . "
A,Elicit,"And new ideas found ? "
D,Task,"Yeah it's all very new comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"no ? "
D,Task,"It's all very new . "
C,Minor,"Yeah I think I'd like to um "
C,Minor,"I dunno . "
C,Minor,"Like it was the "
D,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Task,"I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down comm "
C,Task,"but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like . "
B,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
B,Task,"Well they drop off if you like move too much . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"I dunno . But they're they're okay . "
B,Task,"But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones . "
B,Task,"Maybe we are . "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Uh I think comm and I think that uh "
C,Task,"all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it "
C,Minor,"but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well the thing is comm like I actually worked in a company comm "
C,Minor,"or like I dunno . "
B,Task,"and I had a role and I had to go to meetings . "
B,Task,"And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting . "
B,Task,"Like usually I missed meetings deliberately . "
B,Minor,"There's just "
B,Task,"there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting comm like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hm . "
B,Task,"It's mostly like rehashing old stuff . "
B,Task,"And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"It's like the "
B,Task,"there's just really not a lot of information that goes through . "
A,Task,"Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration . "
B,Task,"It seems like way overkill . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I guess it would be "
C,Task,"it's gotta be worth it to "
C,Minor,"I "
C,Task,"'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful comm "
C,Task,"'cause can't really imagine comm dunno . "
C,Minor,"How about a p a ? "
C,Minor,"Um I dunno . "
A,Elicit,"Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ? "
A,Elicit,"Any other ideas for "
D,Elicit,"What what's the end ? "
D,Minor,"Are we are we supposed to um "
D,Elicit,"you supposed to write a report ? "
D,Elicit,"Or we ending ? "
A,Task,"Um we still have time if there's any other input . "
D,Elicit,"Is that the end ? "
A,Minor,"I mean the "
A,Minor,"I think we did really well personally comm "
A,Task,"which is why we've "
A,Task,"you know comm gone through this so quickly . "
A,Task,"'Cause I mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory comm it fits the budget comm and it's trendy . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"End of meeting . "
D,Task,"You have to tell her comm "
D,Minor,"she "
A,Task,"So I think that's all for today . "
D,Task,"Okay we have to fill in all this stuff . "
D,Other,"Stuff stuff stuff . "
C,Task,"M meeting adjourned . "
A,Task,"Meeting adjourned . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"I think it would be a good idea comm I like it . "
B,Task,"It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . "
B,Task,"Especially if you have food . "
A,Task,"So I guess we're supposed to write final reports . "
A,Minor,"'Cause "
B,Elicit,"All of us ? "
A,Task,"I don't know . Hmm . "
D,Task,"Well there's al eight comm nine . "
D,Other,"Ooh . "
D,Other,"Oh ooh . "
A,Elicit,"Hmm . Or is that just me ? "
