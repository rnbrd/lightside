A,Other,"Hello comm "
A,Task,"uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . "
D,Other,"Hello . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"Hello . "
A,Task,"Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept "
A,Task,"and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be comm "
A,Task,"but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . "
A,Minor,"So comm uh "
A,Task,"we will have again three presentation comm from all of you comm "
A,Task,"and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . "
A,Elicit,"So comm who wants to start ? "
C,Other,"I s "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"No comm no comm "
C,Task,"you you can start . "
D,Other,"Okay comm I'll start . "
A,Task,"So start comm uh "
D,Task,"Can you open my presentation comm "
D,Other,"please . "
A,Other,"Uh . "
D,Task,"I'm number four . "
D,Task,"Trend . "
A,Elicit,"This one ? "
D,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Can you pass the mouse comm "
D,Other,"please . "
D,Task,"Oh okay comm that's fine . "
A,Other,"Turn . "
D,Other,"Okay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um "
D,Task,"the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel comm um as opposed to a functional look and feel comm is our number one priority . "
D,Task,"Um fancy is is is is the comm you know comm highest priority . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . "
D,Task,"Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . "
D,Task,"Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well comm "
D,Task,"but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . "
D,Task,"From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan comm um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes comm shoes and furniture . "
D,Task,"So comm I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . "
D,Task,"And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way . "
B,Elicit,"What does it mean comm spongy ? "
D,Task,"Uh sort of um squishy . "
D,Task,"Um . Yeah soft comm "
B,Elicit,"Like soft comm or something ? "
D,Task,"like a uh like a sponge . "
A,Task,"Like a sponge . Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't know . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . I will see . "
D,Task,"Um so in conclusion comm we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy comm um has lots of technolog tech technology in it . "
D,Task,"Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And that it's easy to use "
D,Task,"and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . Um . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm uh yeah . "
D,Task,"That's it . "
A,Elicit,"Easy to use comm is it uh "
A,Elicit,"a as much as important than technology or fancy thing . "
A,Task,"It's less important comm "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Task,"Less important . "
D,Task,"So um fanciness first and then two ti you know comm half as important as that is technology technology comm "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"and half important as technology is easy to use . So . "
A,Task,"So comm Hamed comm can you . "
C,Other,"Yeah . The second one . "
C,Task,"Could you please show the presentation number three . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature . "
B,Task,"We'll see . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Um . Number ? "
C,Task,"Three . "
A,Other,"Three . "
A,Elicit,"This one ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second . "
C,Task,"Uh comm n n no comm it's the first one . "
C,Task,"The second one . "
A,Task,"So it's not this one . "
C,Task,"Uh yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . "
C,Task,"I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy comm "
C,Task,"but okay comm we can discuss about it uh later . "
C,Task,"Um generally comm generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something comm in my opinion comm uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . "
C,Task,"So comm the more frequent buttons should be larger comm "
C,Task,"they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . "
C,Task,"And uh s uh I can conclude like this comm that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . "
C,Minor,"It should be "
C,Task,"we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control . "
C,Task,"Okay . So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control comm and they should be bigger in size . "
C,Task,"Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand . "
C,Task,"It should not be completely like uh a cube . "
C,Task,"It should be it should have round edge comm so uh then it's easier . "
B,Minor,"Exactly . "
C,Task,"And maybe uh just like some toys comm some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . "
C,Task,"And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery comm it should not uh consume lots of energy . "
C,Task,"Okay . And my personal p uh preference is uh comm as I said comm uh just putting this buttons in a special places "
C,Task,"and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button comm like mobile phone . "
C,Task,"Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part comm "
C,Task,"so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels comm "
C,Task,"and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . "
C,Task,"And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . "
C,Task,"Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . "
C,Task,"Not on remote control . "
C,Task,"I dunno if I can explain well . "
C,Task,"But uh just inside . "
C,Task,"For example comm a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff comm if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . "
C,Task,"So it can be another uh preference . "
C,Task,"And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . "
C,Task,"I know that it consumes lots of energy comm "
C,Task,"but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . "
C,Task,"And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . "
C,Task,"So it may not be very useful but because it's new comm people may buy it . "
C,Task,"Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something . "
C,Task,"Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company comm or . "
C,Task,"Okay . That's mine . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh okay comm so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed comm "
B,Task,"but bad news from Bob obviously comm because spongy design comm I don't like it as "
B,Task,"Okay comm so could you please comm Fabien comm open it . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I'm person two . "
B,Other,"And which one comm "
B,Task,"uh probably the first one . "
B,Task,"I'm not sure "
B,Task,"but check the first one . "
B,Other,"I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board comm but "
A,Elicit,"This one comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's it . "
B,Minor,"Just "
B,Elicit,"It's only this slide ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this comm "
B,Task,"that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers "
B,Minor,"or I'll just "
D,Task,"Inch . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen comm "
B,Task,"which is good news for us comm since we wanted to include a display there . "
B,Other,"Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm . "
B,Other,"This is this is the stuff that I can use to "
A,Other,"Oops . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view . "
B,Task,"Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape comm "
B,Task,"no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device comm but the shape of the inside of the device . "
B,Task,"So there will be some circuit uh for the power . "
B,Task,"So comm say power circuit here . "
B,Task,"Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries "
B,Minor,"that we can uh uh "
B,Task,"And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there comm we must use additional source of energy comm "
B,Task,"which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . "
B,Task,"I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition comm and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells comm so . "
B,Task,"So no problem . "
B,Task,"There can be also solar cell . "
B,Task,"Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres comm "
B,Task,"so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . "
B,Task,"So at least seven to seven . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"It depends where you put your screen comm "
B,Task,"because the screen is uh seven inch comm so it depends on you where where you put it . "
B,Task,"It doesn't matter . "
B,Task,"Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . "
B,Task,"So this will be T_F_T_ . "
B,Task,"And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone comm which is somewhere comm "
B,Task,"say here . "
B,Task,"Interface to the microphone . "
B,Task,"Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ "
B,Task,"and the third unit is the I_R_ . "
B,Task,"The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit "
B,Task,"because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red comm including all the stuff inside comm "
B,Task,"so it will be very cheap for us . "
B,Task,"So infra-red here . "
B,Minor,"So the "
B,Task,"once again the overall requirements comm "
B,Task,"seven to seven centimetres for the board comm "
B,Minor,"which has to be "
B,Task,"which can be spongy but has to be this size comm "
B,Task,"and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . "
B,Other,"Um I have to check what I wanted to "
B,Task,"Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device . "
A,Elicit,"Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing comm or is there any problem for that ? "
A,Task,"For example comm put electronic card on a spongy thing comm I can I can imagine it could be a problem . "
B,Task,"A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape comm basically . "
B,Task,"But we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Well comm sponginess . Maybe it a good feature comm since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good comm because it's just keeps it safe comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
C,Task,"Well maybe it can have two shells comm a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around . "
B,Task,"Well comm it's maybe related to the U_I_ . "
A,Task,"maybe after . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Ca "
D,Other,"Can I ask a question . "
B,Task,"A Yeah comm that's all from me . "
D,Task,"This seven inch T_F_T_ screen comm "
B,Other,"Yeah ? "
D,Elicit,"how big is it in reality ? "
B,Task,"Well comm seven to seven inches . "
D,Elicit,"So like that . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"That's quite big . "
D,Elicit,"Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah but "
A,Task,"No comm I don't think it's seven by seven comm "
A,Task,"I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . "
B,Minor,"To be honest comm I was "
A,Task,"Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . "
D,Task,"But I mean even even that is like this big . "
C,Minor,"Yeah yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I dunno I dun I dun One each "
A,Minor,". But comm yeah comm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but it's seven inches . "
B,Task,"But I I think we can we can cut it . "
D,Elicit,"You can cut the T_F_T_ screen . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm no no problem comm "
A,Task,"Let's go . "
B,Task,"because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but no problem to to me to cut the screen . "
A,Task,"So let's cut the T_F_T_ . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Okay comm "
D,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"So so for the same price we have four screens now . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"These technical engineers comm huh . "
D,Elicit,"So comm what's the size of the device ? "
B,Task,"Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . "
B,Task,"Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something . "
D,Task,"Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that comm you know . "
D,Minor,"Is it "
D,Elicit,"Can you hold that comm or ? "
B,Task,"Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it comm at home comm you know . "
A,Elicit,"What user wants . "
A,Task,"He wants a small remote control comm "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm a small c control that they can hold in hand . "
A,Elicit,"or ? "
A,Task,"Uh uh with big buttons . "
B,Task,"I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"It's difficult . "
A,Minor,"A sm "
D,Elicit,"But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? "
B,Task,"W I I think so . "
B,Task,"I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that comm but just like this comm and you know follow follow "
B,Task,"Well comm that's that's no task for me comm "
B,Task,"but well seven to seven at least yeah comm "
A,Task,"So maybe you can finish your presentation comm "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"and afterwards we will discuss about all this . "
C,Task,"Maybe this . "
B,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Okay thanks . "
A,Task,"That's it . Okay . "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Other,"No . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm so I think we have a lot "
A,Task,"We have to take decision today comm "
A,Task,"so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . "
A,Task,"Uh first I think energy it's a key problem "
A,Task,"because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries comm for example comm or something like that . "
A,Elicit,"Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery comm "
A,Task,"and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? "
B,Minor,"Not "
B,Other,"J uh just a point to the energy th things . "
B,Task,"If we use the batteries comm and the additional so solar cell comm then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"so no problem in energy comm I think . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But we have to use the solar cell . "
C,Minor,"So but "
B,Task,"Otherwise not . "
A,Minor,"Uh like "
A,Elicit,"but using how many batteries comm for example ? "
A,Elicit,"Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery "
B,Task,"Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh one two "
B,Task,"So like three to five centimetres comm "
B,Task,"I dunno exactly comm but . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"So if we use s solar cells comm um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? "
B,Minor,"S "
B,Task,"Uh d doesn't need to be sun . It it's just the daylight comm you know . "
A,Other,"The television lights . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this comm where there is light only when when there are people comm but . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . "
B,Task,"Yeah from the T_ "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I don't think it's enough comm uh . "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Mm . "
B,Elicit,"Ah it's a it's a compromise comm no ? "
A,Task,"At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition comm because you wanted all the new things . "
D,Task,"It's it's quite innovative comm yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
D,Other,"And if you watch T_V_ outside it's very useful . "
A,Task,"So I think before talking about the other thing comm it's important thing it's the case . "
A,Elicit,"Uh what what are gonna be the size comm "
A,Task,"because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . "
A,Task,"For example for the for the L_C_D_ comm if we choose to have a small device comm we cannot use this um a such a a a screen . "
B,Task,"Uh the s the screen is okay comm but the board comm uh that's the problem . "
B,Elicit,"Well what what would you guess as a shape ? "
B,Elicit,"Or what what would be the shape ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I think I think their being uh large or small is not important . "
C,Task,"The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . "
C,Task,"So let's say an average size comm okay comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and it should not be very heavy also . "
C,Task,"And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape comm "
C,Task,"so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner comm maybe maybe . "
C,Task,"So we c it's like like some joysticks . "
C,Task,"You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . "
C,Task,"So the general shape should be like this . "
C,Task,"I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . "
C,Task,"So uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . It's easier . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Which is the same area . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Could you re could you redesign your board ? "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Five to ten . "
D,Task,"Oh comm five five centimetres by ten centimetres . "
B,Minor,"Well that "
B,Task,"Yeah comm right . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think it's feasib "
B,Minor,"Well one um um "
B,Other,"How could we do it ? "
B,Task,"We could put the board next to comm well comm under the L_C_D_ "
B,Task,"and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Like holding something comm and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it comm you know somehow . "
B,Task,"Well But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing comm like one unit . "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ comm if it's possible . "
B,Task,"Well fi five to ten it would be feasible . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so five to ten comm I I think it's it's feasible . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So we are agree with a small "
B,Other,"I'll make it . "
C,Task,"Or uh or I don't know "
B,Task,"Fo Five by ten . "
A,Task,"L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"but I don't want to now invent something new comm because we didn't discuss about it . "
C,Task,"So using some L_C_D_s we can touch comm so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh comm I dunno the name comm L_C_D_ responding to fingers . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Touching the screen . Something like "
A,Task,"Tactile or something comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm comm touch screen . "
C,Task,"Mm like tactile . "
A,Task,"Touch screen comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"because "
A,Task,"The problem is we have a limit in a month of time comm so we cannot do something very new . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Okay comm so "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me "
C,Minor,"A smaller s "
A,Task,"Yeah okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"and I will work it out . "
A,Task,"So comm five by s ten . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Um so what about comm so the case we talked about . "
A,Task,"Um something easy to use comm "
A,Elicit,"you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way comm like with fruit and vegetable comm "
A,Elicit,"and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on comm now comm can we do that ? "
A,Task,"My first idea is because our colour is more yellow comm and the it should be easy to take in a hand comm I thought about banana comm or something like that comm which is fruits comm and "
B,Task,"Seven to ten banana . "
A,Task,"A big banana . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Rather mango or something or . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice comm with the colour of our company . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But it's just an idea . "
A,Elicit,"I dunno what you think about comm but "
D,Elicit,"Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I dunno if it can fit with the technology . "
A,Task,"You are the specialists of that . "
B,Other,"You mean banana . "
B,Minor,"Well comm but "
B,Minor,"If it's If it "
B,Task,"If the banana is big enough . "
B,Task,"Then comm yes . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"But if you want to look at the screen comm no . "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm and "
C,Task,"I think this is not good . "
A,Elicit,"The screen has to be square ? "
A,Elicit,"Or it can be like a a shape comm quite comm uh with curves . "
B,Task,"Well comm it can be whatever you want . "
B,Task,"But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . "
A,Task,"It could . "
B,Task,"But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches comm so . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"It's like more more expensive to have shape like that . "
B,Task,"But I don't care . You know comm if we fit this requirement . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"I'd like a shaped screen . "
D,Task,"I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . "
B,Minor,"Okay "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Minor,"okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it should remember banana comm but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . "
B,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"Like modified banana comm okay . "
B,Elicit,"Well it we'll stick to banana comm or ? "
A,Elicit,"So we are agree with the banana thing ? "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm banana's good . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
A,Task,"So comm the last point we decided it's infra-red comm I guess . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think infra-red . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Everybody's agreed . "
B,Minor,"Sure . "
A,Task,"Uh comm so that's it I think about the concepts . "
A,Elicit,"You have other thing to add to this point comm or uh no ? "
A,Task,"So comm uh about the user interface comm so we are going to use L_C_D_ . "
A,Task,"In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons . "
A,Task,"I don't know what we are going to do with that . "
A,Task,"You talked about the buttons on the side "
B,Task,"Like like peeling of the banana you s "
C,Task,"Yeah comm peeling of the banana . "
B,Task,"It would be cool comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Mm what ? "
B,Task,"Peeling of the banana comm you know comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"should should discover the other buttons comm which are hidden . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And you mean the first layer would be spongy . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"First layer obviously spo Yeah comm "
B,Task,"w It's it's like silly comm but the people will really appreciate it comm yeah I think . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"Is it is it possible to do that ? "
A,Task,"It would be a great idea comm "
A,Elicit,"but is it possible technically ? "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Like doing a spongy layer of the banana comm and you open it . "
D,Task,"I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"you know comm to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm some "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface comm U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . "
C,Task,"If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces comm some some interfaces for adaptor . "
C,Task,"So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this comm with a plastic cover "
C,Task,"and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . "
C,Task,"So comm something like this . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah comm but do you see that as a rigid thing comm or like like a banana comm something very soft comm you can open like banana comm or . "
B,Elicit,"Well is it possible to make it soft ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover comm so . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So I think if it's so then it's cool ? "
A,Elicit,"So comm I dunno what you think comm Bob comm "
A,Task,"but it would be great for users I think comm and very good for marketing . "
D,Task,"I think for sure . Definitely . The softer the better . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Cool . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Honestly speaking comm I cannot imagine it comm so far comm "
B,Task,"but it will be terrible . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"And setting buttons hidden in . "
A,Elicit,"Mm comm other remarks comm or something comm or . "
A,Elicit,"Something we didn't talk about yes yet comm or . "
A,Task,"I think we are almost there . "
A,Elicit,"Uh maybe comm how can we comm if we have a soft thing comm like this comm and to open it we have to attach it somewhere comm I dunno how to do that technically comm or . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"And how "
B,Other,"Pof . "
D,Task,"We could use Velcro . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm maybe . "
D,Task,"Or uh ma maybe a magnetic "
C,Task,"Yes comm yeah it's a good idea . "
D,Task,"thing . "
C,Task,"Magnetic . "
A,Task,"Ma magnetic oh . "
C,Minor,"Mm . Yeah or a Yeah it can is "
C,Task,"it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border comm so it's it sticks like refrigerator door comm completely . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And when you try to open it comm it will be opened easily . "
C,Task,"So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ? "
A,Elicit,"Mm . Likes . Soft plastic comm or "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I imagine some sort of vinyl thing . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel . Maybe . "
B,Task,"Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that comm solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape comm "
B,Minor,"we cannot b uh "
B,Minor,"So we need that the that the peeling "
B,Task,"uh I dunno "
B,Task,"but we should we should take care of these two two things . "
B,Task,"So comm if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed comm then the material must be able to put the light inside comm you know . "
B,Task,"So that we can reach the energy out of it out of that . "
D,Task,"Mm . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"It is possible comm but comm well if it "
D,Task,"And a and a banana . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it comm or or inside . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But then it must be some window there comm you know . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And something we forgot comm maybe comm "
A,Elicit,"uh about the speech recognition system comm are we going to use it comm or not ? "
C,Task,"Yes comm I think . I think so . "
D,Task,"I think it's important . "
A,Task,"It i Yeah comm it seems feasible comm and it would be something very great . "
D,Task,"I think One of our p priorities is tech technology . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"And "
A,Task,"So we have the de design comm the a good shape comm new and so on comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and we have also the technology thing w will be . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And even the easy to use thing comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"so it will be perfect . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"So we add also the speech recognition device . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I agree . "
A,Task,"So comm that great . "
A,Task,"We have decided everything . "
A,Task,"And think we are on a good way . "
A,Task,"So comm um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes . "
A,Task,"Um comm so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . "
A,Task,"The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device . "
A,Task,"And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So comm I hope you can do that in thirty minutes . "
A,Minor,"And uh comm yeah comm I "
A,Task,"uh I think you should work together comm s you uh Hamed and Peter comm to work uh in a in a first prototype comm "
A,Task,"and uh more about the shape and so on "
A,Task,"and how you can manage to put everything together . "
A,Task,"And um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on . "
A,Other,"So thank you all everybody comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"and see you in thirty minutes . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
