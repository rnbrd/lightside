Speaker,DialogAct,Text
A,Minor,"Right "
A,Other,"w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control . "
A,Task,"Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so "
A,Task,"um which we want to to build on comm "
A,Task,"taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand "
A,Task,"and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody comm "
A,Task,"uh one that everybody wants comm "
A,Task,"uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company . "
A,Task,"Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . "
A,Other,"Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital to this project "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"um I'll just go round th the table comm "
A,Task,"Andrew comm marketing comm "
A,Task,"um m Kendra with the uh um designing the the the User Interface "
A,Task,"uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . Um . "
A,Task,"What's uh the the th th project is is here to do comm is is to to get this this project up and moving comm "
A,Task,"ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want comm "
A,Task,"uh everybody has a contribution to make "
A,Task,"and uh everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . "
A,Task,"Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody knows everybody else comm "
A,Task,"everybody's worked for the the company for a while comm "
A,Task,"if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do comm "
A,Task,"if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background "
A,Task,"so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh uh everybody's experience is "
A,Task,"please do so . Uh "
A,Task,"in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves comm "
A,Task,"in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly "
A,Task,"and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make . "
A,Task,"So we'll start with Andrew . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"my name's Andrew "
D,Task,"I'm a I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control "
D,Task,"and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design comm "
D,Task,"what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . "
A,Minor,"Right "
A,Task,"Kendra . "
C,Task,"I'm Kendra "
C,Task,"and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um "
C,Task,"I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before "
C,Minor,"but I'm m "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"I'll be working on the design . "
A,Minor,"Right "
A,Task,"at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas "
A,Minor,"so . "
C,Task,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Yep comm "
C,Other,"I'm just open to being creative . "
A,Minor,"Yep comm "
A,Other,"good . "
B,Task,"Uh I'm Katie comm "
B,Task,"I'm the Industrial Designer "
B,Task,"and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control "
B,Minor,"and uh "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"very very quickly comm um this "
A,Other,"I don't want to make this meeting too structured "
A,Task,"because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank . "
A,Task,"Everybody says what they what they want to say comm "
A,Task,"uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else "
A,Other,"um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . "
A,Task,"The the remote control needs to be original comm "
A,Task,"there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have "
A,Task,"so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different comm "
A,Task,"uh I want one comm "
A,Task,"um and that goes along with being trendy comm uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario . "
A,Task,"User-friendly "
A,Task,"as as we all know comm remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly "
A,Task,"so we want to make ours one that people can pick up "
A,Task,"and think oh yes that's it's obvious how that works comm "
A,Task,"uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that "
A,Task,"I may not need another remote control "
A,Task,"but uh it's such a nice one "
A,Task,"I'm gonna have one . "
A,Task,"And last but not least comm or indeed first of all comm it it must make the company money comm "
A,Task,"and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . "
A,Task,"The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design comm uh what it uh what it must actually do comm "
A,Task,"the uh conceptual design comm uh how we actually present that to the consumer "
A,Task,"and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . "
A,Task,"Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board "
A,Task,"and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here comm um "
A,Task,"In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires comm that we don't do that comm um "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"I I "
A,Task,"everybody knows what whiteboard is "
A,Task,"so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal comm "
A,Task,"but le let's go round the table comm "
A,Elicit,"your favourite animal . "
D,Task,"Um comm badger . "
A,Elicit,"Mm and why ? "
D,Task,"Uh it's it's got nice contrast with black and white and uh "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"I feel they're underdog kind of status "
D,Minor,"and they're comm the "
A,Minor,"Oh right "
A,Task,"uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse "
A,Task,"'cause of the the white streaks in it . "
A,Elicit,"Kendra . "
C,Task,"Um probably a duck "
C,Task,"I just I li I like the way they look "
C,Task,"and they're just nice animals "
C,Task,"and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Minor,"Right comm "
A,Task,"okay . "
B,Task,"Uh 's horses comm "
B,Task,"no particular reason why . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh comm "
A,Other,"fair enough yeah . "
A,Task,"I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest comm "
A,Task,"I think homo sapien "
A,Task,"because of their their uh overall ability to uh uh "
D,Task,"Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
D,Task,"to make T_V_ remotes . "
A,Task,"Indeed absolutely yes comm "
A,Minor,"tha that's um "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,"and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um comm "
A,Task,"we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros "
A,Task,"so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet "
A,Task,"and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . "
A,Task,"It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . "
A,Task,"Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product comm "
A,Task,"we're looking at making it at a very good price . "
A,Minor,"Um comm okay comm um "
A,Elicit,"would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons "
C,Task,"and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well . "
C,Task,"Um comm but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons "
A,Minor,"No . "
C,Minor,"and "
C,Task,"so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled "
C,Task,"and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use comm "
C,Elicit,"you know . "
A,Elicit,"Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ? "
A,Elicit,"Or anybody else comm strong feelings about remote controls ? "
A,Elicit,"Are there you know comm bad ones they've used "
A,Elicit,"or good ones they've used "
A,Elicit,"or ones that they've lost and never found again ? "
B,Task,"Um I think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere "
B,Task,"and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself "
B,Task,"and twist your remote control to get it the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Think a lot of the time comm remotes that come with T_V_ players and T_V_s and D_V_ players comm like they aren't "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"like an area that's put a lot of effort into comm "
D,Task,"they're very boring comm "
D,Task,"very plain . "
D,Minor,"Like "
D,Minor,"it's very a very "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"like um "
D,Task,"making a a stylish remote control would be a very like "
D,Task,"Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . "
A,Elicit,"Um what so wh what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about ? "
D,Task,"Um . Something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control . "
D,Task,"So if you want comm something that looks like uh something that makes you think oh what's this ? "
D,Task,"Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen comm "
D,Task,"but it makes you think oh . "
A,Other,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
A,Minor,". Yeah "
D,Other,"sorry "
D,Task,"that's a bit vague . "
A,Minor,"d "
A,Task,"no "
A,Elicit,"I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control comm "
A,Elicit,"people won't see it as a remote control "
A,Minor,"um and uh "
D,Task,"Uh I suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product . "
A,Other,"Uh-huh . "
A,Elicit,"Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls ? "
C,Task,"I think something that's comfortable to hold "
C,Task,"because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big comm rectangular things "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto comm "
C,Task,"so something that's more comfortable "
C,Task,"that fits in a person's hand better . "
A,Task,"I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses "
A,Task,"which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"and s you know some quite fancy ones "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"um than the "
A,Task,"some from personal experience which look nice "
A,Task,"but aren't particularly comfortable . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Um any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"from the mouse idea you could comm "
D,Task,"remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it "
D,Task,"which you press comm "
D,Minor,"whereas if you want "
D,Task,"could all be flat "
D,Task,"and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle "
D,Task,"that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see comm like a mouse button . "
A,Minor,"Yes comm "
A,Task,"I mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I suppose . "
A,Task,"fi find the button buttons easily . "
D,Task,"Easily comm yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down "
C,Task,"so you could feel them "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"better . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"that's uh "
A,Task,"must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons comm "
A,Task,"that's uh certainly be different . "
A,Minor,"Um do we need it to uh "
A,Task,"I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all . "
A,Elicit,"Do we do we want uh "
C,Task,"Oh yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm that would be good . "
C,Elicit,"Like a like a mobile phone ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm comm yeah that would be good . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So comm "
A,Elicit,"Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something "
A,Task,"which there are already millions out there "
A,Task,"and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire um the planet with ? "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm comm um especially if we try to sell comm what two million of them . "
D,Other,"Oh sorry comm "
D,Task,"four million of 'em comm "
D,Minor,"but uh I think if w if we market it as as not as not "
D,Minor,"well "
D,Minor,"this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two "
D,Task,"we could have parallel marketing s schemes "
D,Task,"where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool comm is fashionable "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"and like you just "
D,Task,"it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"but that might "
D,Task,"considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice comm "
D,Minor,"therefore they want it "
D,Task,"so make it practical at the same time . "
D,Task,"I think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room "
D,Task,"uh but also a device that uh "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"is practically sound . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Okay comm yeah comm yeah comm well "
D,Minor,"So um comm "
D,Task,"I dunno "
D,Task,"we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both . "
D,Minor,"If you . "
A,Task,"I d I think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Um okay well "
A,Elicit,"first thoughts on um "
A,Elicit,"the the industrial design side . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Task,"I think it's it's remote controls are kind of a unique object "
B,Task,"'cause it's you depend on them so much comm "
B,Minor,"but you don't i i it's "
B,Task,"you sort of just assume they're always gonna work comm "
B,Minor,"you don't think of them as a comp "
B,Task,"like a computer can break down "
B,Task,"and you're kinda like oh well fair enough "
B,Task,"there's all these complex things going on comm "
B,Minor,"it's gonna "
B,Task,"something's gonna get messed up eventually . "
B,Task,"They they just need to be very very dependable "
B,Task,"because people sort of take them for granted "
B,Task,"and then if your remote control breaks it's God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel "
A,Task,"Indeed . "
B,Minor,"it just "
B,Task,"it needs to be very effective comm very always dependable . Uh "
B,Task,"I don't think we should make it too small "
B,Minor,"I 'cause I think it needs to "
B,Task,"it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward comm "
B,Task,"but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um comm it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But "
B,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"yes "
B,Task,"dependable comm and have a good medium range size . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"and um colours comm materials ? Kendra comm anyone ? "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey comm "
C,Task,"so maybe we should go with something different "
C,Minor,"or be able to "
C,Task,"I was just thinking of um what they're doing with mobile phones now "
C,Task,"how you can get the different um what are they called ? Like the face-plates "
A,Minor,". "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm comm mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"that you change "
C,Minor,"so we could have maybe "
C,Task,"I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that comm "
C,Task,"where you can change the face-plates "
C,Task,"or have kind of a variety "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"so people can get different different things . "
C,Task,"Have it kind of look how they want to comm different colours comm things like that comm "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"probably just plastic "
C,Task,"because that's always the lightest . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Minor,"that's uh "
A,Task,"Again I don't think that's ever been done before comm "
A,Task,"it's uh the sort of the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that I haven't got and uh "
A,Task,"might need "
A,Minor,"so . Uh "
A,Elicit,"Andrew comm any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ? "
D,Minor,"Um comm well "
D,Task,"we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour "
D,Minor,"or with like you buy it with several "
D,Minor,"uh like "
D,Task,"you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy "
D,Task,"or as a separate thing comm "
D,Task,"but uh maybe thinking of that comm it's considering the nature of the device comm maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and then forget about it . "
D,Minor,"Unless you were trying to "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"you could come up with like novelty ones comm "
A,Minor,"I think "
B,Task,"like they've done with the the mobile phones comm "
B,Task,"you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Minor,"it's "
B,Task,"and sorta stagger the release of them "
D,Task,"that's a that's a good idea . "
B,Task,"and get people like oh I want that cover on it now "
B,Task,"and that'll keep them spending money . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Right comm okay "
D,Task,"Yeah true . "
A,Task,"I think we've got um a good idea now . "
A,Minor,"We uh "
A,Task,"meeting is uh "
A,Task,"Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . "
A,Minor,"So uh um "
A,Task,"we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail . "
A,Task,"Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes "
A,Task,"and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised . "
A,Other,"Uh thank you very much indeed . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Minor,". "
