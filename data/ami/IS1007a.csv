B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Other,"Good morning everybody . "
C,Other,"Good morning . "
D,Other,"Good morning . "
B,Other,"Good morning . "
A,Task,"So comm we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television . "
A,Task,"And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . "
A,Task,"So people can can use it without any any problem . "
A,Minor,". "
A,Other,"I don't know . "
C,Task,"Well comm I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"B did you send us an email about this ? "
A,Task,"Uh comm not yet comm "
A,Other,"but if you want "
B,Task,"Yeah comm we we received an email about this uh d designs . "
A,Other,"Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? "
B,Task,"Ah it's Okay . "
A,Minor,"Or "
D,Task,"Or you can put it in the shared folder . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"you see the email ? "
B,Minor,"You email . "
B,Minor,"The v very "
B,Task,"no comm no "
B,Task,"the first one . "
D,Task,"No comm I didn't get it . "
B,Task,"It's inside . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"This one . "
B,Task,"No comm no . "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"The third one . "
B,Task,"Oh comm you didn't get anything . "
D,Task,"No comm . "
B,Task,"It's strange . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I got an email about the dis about the discussion . Yeah . "
A,Minor,". "
A,Elicit,"You get email comm . "
B,Task,"I dunno from who . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm from the account manager . "
B,Task,"From the account manager . "
B,Elicit,"You have received the same email comm right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so each of us has a role to do . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"S "
D,Task,"I think assign your uh roles . "
B,Minor,"In each "
B,Task,"We already have our role . "
A,Task,"For each for each one . "
D,Task,"For each person comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"'Kay comm we can "
A,Minor,"So there are "
A,Minor,"so we have three "
B,Task,"So there are three kinds of designs comm that's all . "
A,Task,"f yeah . "
A,Task,"We have functional design comm conceptual design comm and detail design . "
B,Task,"Okay comm alright . "
A,Elicit,"So comm who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? "
A,Elicit,"Any any volunteer ? "
C,Task,"I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"I'm doing the interface . "
A,Other,"You are doing th "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"I'm doing the interface . "
A,Minor,". "
B,Elicit,"Are you using the you are doing the in "
C,Task,"Yeah I I'm I'm "
C,Minor,"Well comm maybe we have "
C,Task,"okay so I industrial design . "
C,Task,"It was a little confusion about my uh "
B,Minor,"Ah "
C,Task,"but it's alright . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay comm I'll for industrial design . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And and you Norman ? "
B,Minor,"Mm ? "
B,Task,"Um working on i . User interface . "
C,Task,"User . "
A,Elicit,"And "
A,Elicit,"And "
D,Task,"Uh comm I'm into marketing . "
A,Other,"doing the marketing . "
D,Task,"yeah "
D,Task,"nothing much in the project . "
A,Elicit,"Nothing related here to the "
D,Task,"Marketing in this design . "
D,Task,"A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"You see the second mail ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's inside . "
B,Task,"Go down . "
B,Task,"Appendix . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm this is . "
B,Task,"See there's a role for everybody . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right comm "
D,Minor,"first . "
B,Task,"Even for the marketing . "
D,Minor,"us user define . "
A,Minor,"Next . "
B,Task,"But look at your role comm your marketing role . "
D,Task,"There's a trend watching . "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"that's your role . "
A,Minor,"I . "
C,Task,"Well comm I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done "
C,Task,"and what are your ideas about the "
A,Task,"About the design or "
A,Task,"Maybe we'll discuss this later comm no ? "
C,Task,"Well comm w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"how we can make it work . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"I mean working remotes we already have . "
D,Task,"This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm I dunno I "
A,Task,"What we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . "
A,Task,"And of course it should not be very costly . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points "
C,Task,"and um we should discuss it in the next meeting comm or "
B,Task,"Need to collect information . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"About the "
A,Elicit,"about what ? "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"I I'm part of design comm perhaps . "
B,Task,"Uh comm what is most important in a in a remote control ? "
B,Task,"What is the most important function aspect ? "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Elicit,"You mean the external or "
C,Task,"Well comm you have to make it work . "
C,Task,"That's the that's the big thing . "
A,Task,"Yeah of g of course . "
B,Task,"That's alright . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it should be easy to work with . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"We can think about an interface with uh well "
B,Task,"Uh . We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . "
B,Task,"You just tell the television I want which channel . "
B,Task,"Or or you can say for example comm um I want uh to list all the programme tonight . "
A,Minor,"You won't "
B,Task,"Y you know comm instead of uh remote control it's doing the some searching for you comm "
B,Task,"so you don't have to look for the channel you want . "
B,Task,"Just say maybe I just want to press I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . "
B,Task,"Or a button for all the magazines comm all the information documentary tonight . "
B,Task,"And then you list a few comm "
B,Task,"and I will choose from the list . "
B,Task,"So instead of pressing the channel number comm I am choosing the programmes directly . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's one way of uh making it useful . "
A,Task,"I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Minor,"because "
B,Task,"no comm "
B,Task,"it's not very a lot . "
A,Minor,"S "
B,Task,"Th this information exists . "
B,Minor,"For example you can get um "
A,Task,"Like s uh you you you say we can use speech . "
B,Task,"You can use uh well for example anything . "
B,Task,"The the idea of using speech to reduce the button comm but uh and it's more natural . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I "
C,Task,"I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno "
D,Minor,"I'm a okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand "
D,Task,"and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . "
A,Other,"In the hand . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"If we are going to add a speech interface comm I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes comm possible . "
D,Task,"if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . But "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And I could talk to the T_V_ television itself . "
A,Task,"Except if if you are far from the T_V_ . "
D,Minor,"I need not have an "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I mean we have some or something comm different technology but "
A,Minor,"This is it's "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function comm instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel comm there's a option you can choose comm either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . "
C,Task,"On the content . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea "
B,Task,"So it's more powerful . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . "
B,Task,"They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . "
B,Task,"We don't care . "
B,Task,"We just say that this are some content . "
B,Task,"We just want to retrieve the content "
B,Task,"and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . "
B,Task,"Some of the websites they already provide this service comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"so we can just use the service available . "
B,Task,"Download it uh to the to this remote control . "
B,Task,"And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories comm or sev seven . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"The most there are only seven buttons . "
B,Task,"So I just choose the category one "
B,Task,"and you reuse the same button comm for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want comm "
B,Task,"so you don't have to choose among hundred channels comm if you have hundred channels comm "
B,Task,"you just have six buttons comm seven buttons . "
A,Task,"Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons . "
C,Task,"Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way comm so "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"This is good idea . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Ah comm yes . "
B,Minor,"So . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so you don't have to display here comm "
B,Task,"just display on the T_V_ screen comm right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen "
B,Task,"Good idea . "
C,Task,"and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . "
B,Task,"Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers comm lots of buttons "
B,Task,"and then you dunno what to choose in the end . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . So "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Alright . "
C,Task,"I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So we have five minutes to "
B,Task,"Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . "
A,Minor,"Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so comm can we "
B,Task,"Five minutes . "
D,Task,"And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So comm I mean comm if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene comm the lights adapt themself . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"S "
D,Task,"The lighting in the room changes . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but we are designing just remote control . "
A,Minor,"You it . "
D,Task,"I mean comm we have a option in the remote control . "
D,Task,"If we want to have that option comm you press that button in the remote . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Oh right so "
B,Task,"Okay comm do you want to have a conceptual remote control there comm "
B,Task,"or you just want to put the function in ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"If if you you you can if you want you can use th the . "
C,Elicit,"Please comm Norman comm draw uh "
B,Other,"Go on comm draw something . "
D,Task,"Oh comm I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"Where is it ? "
D,Task,"The lapel . "
A,Minor,"Or before the before the the design that says . "
B,Minor,"Ah comm okay . "
B,Elicit,"Where where is it ? "
B,Task,"Here . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that one . "
D,Unlab,"Just plug it . "
A,Elicit,"Norman . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Be before before writing you can uh sit "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"and that says what we what we said "
A,Task,"then after that you can you can use the . Yeah . "
B,Other,"Okay comm alright . "
B,Minor,"So so the most functional des mm "
B,Task,"the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . Right ? "
B,Elicit,"We agree on that comm right ? "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh comm uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons . Uh to choose uh content s or channels . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So we have both . "
B,Task,"The user can choose w which one they want comm right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm by content or by channel comm "
C,Task,"it's a good idea . "
B,Task,"By content or by channel . "
B,Task,"Choose by contents or by channels . "
B,Elicit,"And then what did we say just now ? Other than this . "
C,Task,"And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Challenge . "
C,Task,"I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel "
C,Task,"but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Content . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"so these we have to work it out . "
B,Task,"So this one of the problem . "
B,Minor,"And uh "
C,Task,"I think that's the the things to do "
B,Minor,"The main thing . "
C,Task,"and uh to uh reflect about it "
B,Minor,"Okay . Alright . "
C,Task,"and uh discuss it in the next meeting . "
B,Minor,"Alright comm okay . "
B,Minor,"So we are "
B,Other,"we'll discuss it "
B,Other,"we will get some information in the next meeting comm "
B,Task,"so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer ? "
B,Task,"That's the first aspect . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"We will get information "
B,Task,"and then we'll come back in . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,". "
C,Other,"Thank you everybody . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm we'll come . "
A,Task,"So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? "
A,Task,"And we'll discuss the other other aspects . "
B,Task,"Alright . "
B,Task,"Alright comm okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Thank you comm "
A,Other,"Okay . Well thank you all . "
B,Minor,"mis "
