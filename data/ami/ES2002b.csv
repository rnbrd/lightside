B,Elicit,"Is that alright now ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Sorry ? "
B,Elicit,"Okay comm everybody all set to start the meeting ? "
B,Task,"Okay comm we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design . "
D,Task,"Could you plug me in ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
B,Elicit,"All ready to go ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Um so hopefully you've all been working away comm "
B,Task,"and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . "
B,Other,"Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time . "
B,Task,"Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment "
B,Task,"and started to discuss um a bit about the project comm you know comm cost-wise how much how much money we had to s "
B,Task,"Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements comm "
B,Task,"which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . "
B,Task,"Nobody uses teletext very much anymore comm "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . "
B,Task,"Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television comm not the V_C_R_ comm D_V_D_ or anything else . "
B,Task,"I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production comm the time to market . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So um comm we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . "
B,Task,"And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . "
B,Task,"Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . "
B,Task,"It might be yellow comm because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . "
D,Elicit,"And the slogan comm like the actual written slogan comm or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? "
B,Task,"Well that's the thing comm I'm I'm not sure um "
B,Elicit,"uh th because on the the company website comm uh what does it say "
D,Task,"'Bout putting the fashion in electronics . "
B,Minor,"Uh something "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
B,Elicit,"I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it comm "
B,Task,"'cause it's quite long . "
B,Task,"Um or yeah comm just the idea comm but I'm not sure . "
B,Task,"So that's something we can discuss as well . "
B,Task,"So those are the three things comm "
B,Task,"just not to worry about teletext comm uh only control the T_V_ comm and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . "
B,Elicit,"Um so is everybody okay with any of that "
B,Elicit,"comm or do you want me to recap at all ? "
A,Task,"Nope comm we're all set . "
B,Minor,"Right um comm "
B,Task,"time for presentations then . "
B,Elicit,"Who would like to go first ? "
C,Other,"I'll go first . "
D,Task,"Sure . "
B,Task,"Okay comm cool . "
C,Minor,"Alright um comm "
C,Other,"can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ? Uh "
B,Task,"Oh yeah comm of course comm yeah . "
B,Task,"G go on ahead . "
C,Task,"so this is the technical functions design . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"Right "
C,Task,"to do the um the design I have I've had a look online comm I've had a look at the homepage comm "
C,Task,"which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer "
C,Elicit,"and um I would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . "
C,Task,"Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room comm so "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um comm having a look at the existing products comm I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes comm "
C,Task,"there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons comm lots of colours comm very confusing comm you don't know what you're doing . "
C,Task,"Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . "
C,Other,"Um there's an example I'll show you at the end comm "
C,Other,"um sh show you now . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"here um the button there and there . "
C,Task,"This one's prog . "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Task,"That one's perg and that one's prog comm "
C,Task,"and it doesn't really tell you what it does . "
C,Task,"Um comm not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . "
C,Task,"Um it's a very simple one . "
C,Task,"It's got only the basic functions mm "
C,Task,"but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one . "
B,Other,"Oop . "
C,Task,"Uh it looked a bit clunky . "
C,Task,"They're very big and not very much use for buttons . "
C,Minor,"Um comm "
C,Task,"and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . "
C,Task,"There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button . "
C,Task,"Um comm my own preferences comm I prefer the the clunky one . "
C,Task,"Um it's very easy to use . "
C,Task,"Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions "
C,Task,"which I I quite like having on the controls . "
C,Task,"Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer comm "
C,Task,"or something like tha from the bottom of it . "
C,Elicit,"So comm now I'd like to ask for your preferences . "
C,Task,"Um not sure of how long we've got comm uh "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Just a couple of minutes anyway . "
D,Task,"M yeah comm like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . "
D,Other,"So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences "
D,Other,"but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"But anyway comm "
D,Task,"um we might come to that later . "
B,Minor,"Shall we sh "
B,Task,"well we'll stick to kind of your area for now . "
A,Elicit,"Which which is the clunky one comm the one on left or on the right?. . "
C,Task,"Um comm the clunky one is the one on the right . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Um clunky in what sense comm "
D,Elicit,"like um h heavier ? Larger ? "
C,Task,"Um I think it's supposed to be the same size comm but um it's got much fewer buttons . "
C,Task,"It's comm you know comm it's very spread out "
D,Task,"I see comm so it's more just basic . "
B,Task,"Looks kind of Yeah . "
C,Minor,"and kind of you know "
D,Task,"Right comm okay . "
C,Task,"comm I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"got very few buttons on it and "
D,Task,"Yeah . Sure . "
B,Task,"Well I think it's a valid point . "
B,Task,"I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated comm "
B,Task,"and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing . "
B,Task,"Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design comm "
B,Task,"but yeah you don't want to lose out on comm you know comm what it does comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"so maybe you know "
B,Task,"you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open comm "
B,Task,"I think that's a good idea . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I think it's a good idea . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"Um comm do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ? "
C,Task,"I mean so far I've got um on and off comm um switch the channel up and down comm and put the volume up and down . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ . "
B,Task,"Uh-huh comm "
B,Task,"and then actual numbers for channels as well comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Um comm you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? "
D,Other,"Which was that ? "
C,Minor,"Would you like "
C,Task,"um the channels like the the numbers on thing comm um "
D,Elicit,"Up the numbers comm or the up down ? "
B,Task,"God comm I wou I would say that's required comm "
B,Task,"I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"I mean would anybody disagree with that ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Um comm what else comm uh "
B,Task,"So don't need to worry about teletext comm "
B,Task,"don't need to worry about V_C_R_ comm "
B,Elicit,"uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about comm "
D,Elicit,"We don't ? No ? "
B,Task,"you know like brightness and contrast ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . "
D,Task,"We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"Is that right ? "
D,Elicit,"Is that what we're we're doing ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Um comm yeah . "
D,Elicit,"We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? "
C,Minor,"Um "
B,Elicit,"I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ? "
C,Task,"Uh comm to start with um sort of a bit both comm "
C,Task,"um we need to find out exactly what we have to have "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"um and after that we can add things if they're possible . "
B,Task,"Okay comm right . "
B,Task,"Well comm do you wanna maybe just comm at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Um comm so so far comm just to recap you've got volume and channel control and "
C,Task,"There's um on and off comm um volume and channel comm and skip to certain channels with the numbers . "
B,Task,"Right okay . "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Well comm one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types comm "
D,Task,"so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . "
D,Task,"For example if we had audio controls comm those could be something people set up very rarely . "
B,Minor,"Oka "
D,Task,"Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"things like channel and volume um are used all the time comm "
D,Task,"so we just have them right out on top comm "
D,Task,"um very just very sort of self-explanatory . "
D,Task,"Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls comm "
D,Task,"you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . "
D,Task,"And others that are uh also available "
D,Task,"and then others that are concealed . "
D,Other,"Something like that . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Uh well comm just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section "
B,Other,"Have I just lost "
B,Other,"Oh no . "
B,Elicit,"Um comm uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements comm "
B,Task,"and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that comm "
B,Task,"maybe like a mute button comm "
B,Other,"that sort of thing . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Any of you anything to add to that at all ? "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"I'll add it later comm I guess the presentation . "
B,Task,"Okay comm right . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um okay comm "
B,Task,"if we can move on to next presentation then please . Um "
D,Other,"Sure . "
C,Elicit,"Do you want to switch places ? "
B,Minor,"Do you wanna "
D,Elicit,"Can this can this pl reach ? "
D,Elicit,"Can this plug come across ? "
A,Task,"No . No . "
B,Task,"Probably not comm actually . "
D,Task,"No . "
D,Other,"So why don't I just pick up and move then . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Here comm I'll just "
D,Minor,"Why don't I just "
D,Task,"Mm er comm can you go up behind me ? "
C,Task,"Just just switch them . "
D,Minor,"Kinda This is so This "
B,Task,"bit complicated . "
B,Task,"It'd be nice if everything was wireless comm wouldn't it ? "
D,Task,"I'm all in a knot now . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Right . "
D,Other,"Um . So I can I can say already comm "
D,Task,"I dunno whether this is for good or for bad "
D,Task,"but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things . "
B,Elicit,"Oh comm like overlap between what you said ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Oh well comm for all you know that that'll happen . "
D,Task,"Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing comm "
D,Minor,"but may "
D,Task,"what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here "
D,Minor,"so um "
D,Task,"so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine comm "
D,Task,"because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely . "
D,Task,"Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been "
B,Task,"Mm hard to know what where your role ends comm yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So how do I how do I get this up ? "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um function F_ eight . "
B,Task,"Uh pr yeah comm press function and F_ eight comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Alright . So "
D,Elicit,"F_ eight ? "
A,Task,"Function comm the blue button . Next to the control on the left . "
D,Task,"Oh comm and F_ eight . Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"You have to push it together . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Okay comm I think that that's doing it now . "
A,Task,"Nope . "
A,Task,"Try that again . "
D,Elicit,"Uh comm again ? "
C,Task,"Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose . "
A,Minor,"Wait . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you wanna "
D,Minor,"Um comm "
B,Other,"Oh oh here we go . "
A,Task,"Yep comm there we go . "
D,Task,"okay great . "
B,Other,"There you go . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Just um "
D,Task,"Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing . "
D,Task,"And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding comm 'kay what what are our options comm what should we decide "
D,Elicit,"and do you know what I mean comm so . "
A,Task,"Increase that 'cause we can't see the "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"That's much better . "
B,Task,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Can you um "
A,Other,"There you go . "
B,Task,"Right comm okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . Alright . "
D,Minor,"That would be "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"So um does that make sense ? "
D,Task,"So what I basically got is I just looked into some information "
D,Task,"and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it "
D,Minor,"and how we could "
D,Task,"and what kind of decisions we could take away from it "
D,Task,"and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . "
D,Task,"'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . "
D,Task,"So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs comm "
D,Task,"that we start with the customer comm "
D,Task,"and w you know comm what they want "
D,Task,"and what are issues with with um existing products . "
D,Task,"Uh to think about trends "
D,Task,"and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision "
D,Task,"which is about fashion in electronics . "
D,Task,"Um and then comm as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this "
D,Minor,"and um "
A,Task,"Bouncing on top . "
D,Minor,"Dunno . Okay . Um . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So this is what I've found here comm "
D,Task,"um a lot of this is new to me comm "
D,Task,"so we'll just read through together . "
D,Task,"Um comm users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . "
D,Task,"So they find them ugly . "
D,Task,"Most people find them ugly . "
D,Task,"Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well comm "
D,Task,"we'll see later comm the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control comm such as voice recognition . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Okay I'm gonna "
D,Task,"we'll look at that in a second . "
D,Task,"Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . "
D,Task,"So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology comm "
D,Task,"they tend to use the most simple controls "
D,Task,"and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like "
D,Task,"if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations comm you know comm "
D,Task,"one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . "
D,Task,"And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side comm we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . "
D,Minor,"Um comm "
D,Task,"frustrations . "
D,Task,"They get lost a lot comm "
D,Task,"s as it came up in our last meeting . "
D,Task,"Um comm takes time to learn how to use them . "
D,Task,"This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls comm "
D,Task,"so d it doesn't just look like a big panel comm "
D,Task,"kinda like when you you look at comm you know comm a new computer keyboard comm "
D,Task,"or something that is quite explanatory . "
D,Task,"If you want audio comm if you want visual comm then you have those . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for . "
B,Task,"Repetitive strain injury . "
A,Elicit,"Is installing a new remote control something that people "
D,Task,"Uh comm no comm that did not come up at all . "
D,Task,"Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . "
D,Minor,"I also found that most people would "
D,Task,"uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . "
D,Task,"Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . "
D,Task,"So I dunno "
D,Task,"if that's possible we might consider getting into it . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this comm "
D,Task,"I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um people uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products comm "
D,Task,"so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like . "
D,Task,"You know comm they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So want something that looks good and is easy to use comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"big priorities . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this . "
D,Task,"So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . "
D,Task,"You know comm it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days comm something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can comm "
D,Task,"but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together comm you know . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"That's "
B,Task,"I think it's a good idea . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"That's s that's sort of the um "
D,Minor,"But I I'm "
D,Task,"my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay comm well how do we collectively move on with it . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles comm and then use that . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"But not let that confine us technologically . "
B,Task,"Okay . Right . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"Alright ? "
D,Elicit,"Any um comments on all of that ? "
B,Task,"Well comm um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our our target audience comm our target market . "
D,Minor,"That's uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Um comm so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use comm but has y is fairly powerful product comm whatever comm who do we really want to aim that at ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"I mean "
D,Task,"Where's the money comm maybe . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm who wou who would have the money to spend . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine comm "
D,Task,"And who watches T_V_ . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"well I don't "
B,Task,"I'm not really sure how much that will retail at . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"But you want "
B,Task,"it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly comm I suppose comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"they're gonna actually go out and buy one . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"So comm who do you think we're aiming this at ? "
A,Task,"Um comm I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market comm in terms of people . "
A,Elicit,"'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote comm how much is that lo locally in pounds ? "
B,Task,"It's about sixteen comm seventeen pounds comm I think . "
A,Minor,"Is that too "
A,Elicit,"is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"okay . "
A,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"Um so maybe not the high end range comm but maybe middle comm middle up-ish . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Kind of . "
A,Elicit,"You know how much ? "
A,Task,"I dunno "
A,Elicit,"I guess you pay comm what comm ten ten quid for a remote ? "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Like a simple replacement comm right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"This this kinda touches on your comments there comm David . "
A,Minor,"would you "
A,Elicit,"how much would you pay ? "
D,Task,"These are the age groups which we have information on "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"and these are "
D,Task,"this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . "
D,Task,"Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is . "
B,Minor,"Okay "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Mostly focused around the twenty five age group . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Sort of young professional comm kind of . Mm-hmm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Minor,"Um "
B,Elicit,"Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? "
B,Elicit,"What what do you think comm Craig ? "
C,Elicit,"Well comm did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? "
C,Task,"Sort of the the older group . "
D,Task,"Uh comm yeah comm it's the "
D,Task,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Uh f "
D,Task,"It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying comm "
B,Minor,"N yeah . "
D,Minor,"in terms of "
B,Task,"I think we are gonna have to narrow it down comm "
B,Task,"to say let's target these people and give them what they want "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"and 'cause you know comm there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Sure . "
D,Minor,"Sure . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"So um anybody anything there to add "
B,Task,"Just kind of young professionals comm "
B,Minor,"uh th like "
B,Task,"if we are going to include speech recognition comm it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So we could say that was our target . "
A,Task,"I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . Yeah . "
A,Task,"because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so fifteen to thirty five comm look fairly young . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You know comm they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I think people who are maybe about I wouldn't say thirty five comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"But "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm sure . "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So these are people who are gadgety comm right ? "
A,Task,"People who are u growing up used to comm you know in schools and in universities comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"when you go on to their working lives comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"people who would you know regular "
B,Task,"So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That that's that's a good point . "
B,Minor,"Um okay comm so um "
B,Task,"so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition "
D,Task,"If we can . "
B,Task,"if we can . "
A,Task,"I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"because um comm based on what you've go y everybody's saying comm right comm you want something simple . "
B,Elicit,"Why is that ? "
A,Task,"You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . "
A,Task,"Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . "
D,Task,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Could it be an on off thing ? "
A,Minor,"Um comm "
D,Minor,"Like if you want it on "
B,Elicit,"Where you can activate it and deactivate it ? "
A,Task,"but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say comm and then comm you know comm say speech recognition is good for this comm speech recognition is not good for this . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Sure . "
D,Minor,"Sure . "
A,Minor,"So maybe we should "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I suggest that we think about speech recognition comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function comm "
A,Task,"but at end of the day we don't look at the technology comm but we look at the function first . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Sure . Yep . "
B,Minor,"Uh okay comm "
B,Task,"well do you wanna um give us your presentation "
A,Other,"Okay comm sure . "
B,Minor,"and then then we can "
B,Minor,"I don't know "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm it's good "
B,Minor,"but this is this is how we're "
D,Task,"well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm exactly comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well "
B,Task,"is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition comm that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . "
D,Minor,"Not "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
D,Minor,"And not losing . "
D,Task,"And also it helps in terms of people not losing this comm "
D,Task,"you know they they're saying oh it's I lose it in the couch . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"that they "
C,Task,"I reckon one problem with speech recognition is "
C,Task,"um I've actually seen one of them used "
C,Task,"and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing comm "
C,Task,"so you end up yelling at the control for hours . "
B,Elicit,"Really ? "
D,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"Channel up . "
D,Task,"Oh really comm you've seen one before . "
B,Elicit,"Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in . "
A,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Task,"do you mind passing me my notepad . "
B,Other,"Mm . Course not . "
A,Other,"Thanks . "
A,Task,"Cool comm "
B,Other,"There you go . "
A,Minor,"um . Okay . Um . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Well this is just the working design um . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Well this is just what how I would go about it . "
A,Task,"Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now comm "
A,Task,"try to define what we're trying to get done . "
A,Task,"Um I think in a practical way comm we kind of know what it is . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"We've used it comm "
A,Task,"we're familiar with it comm "
A,Task,"but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil comm like "
A,Task,"Besides the basics comm "
A,Task,"I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . "
A,Task,"Has to change channels comm has to change volume comm "
A,Task,"but in like specifics comm right comm which one of the basics are you trying to target . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? "
A,Minor,"Um and I just "
A,Minor,"the idea is just to get everybody to um "
A,Task,"I usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic comm "
A,Task,"so comm you know comm things that to start everything going . "
A,Task,"But I guess everybody does have some idea comm "
A,Task,"so I don't think um there's a need for that . "
A,Task,"Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing comm "
A,Other,"so I'll go into the diagram first . "
A,Task,"It just explains how the process goes through comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"from a "
A,Task,"from the basic technology point of view comm "
A,Task,"the basic steps that you need "
A,Task,"um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"you need some power source . "
A,Task,"'Kay comm a battery or something comm to keep it going . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um and that power source is important "
A,Task,"because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies "
A,Task,"um how far you can transmit the signal "
A,Task,"or the complexity of the functions that you want . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Like for example comm voice recognition comm right . "
A,Task,"That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone comm "
A,Task,"you might need to power other things comm "
A,Task,"so that's one perhaps constraint there . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Th Okay comm the basic thing is there's a user interface "
A,Task,"where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes comm whatever . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"You know comm and that um picks up an input from a user comm "
A,Minor,"um uh a logic "
A,Task,"a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device comm "
A,Task,"and the device has to r you know comm based on you push button A_ comm so I will do something with button A_ . "
A,Task,"So maybe button A_ is the power button comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself "
A,Task,"which is the receiver here . "
A,Task,"Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um . "
A,Task,"It's fairly general comm "
A,Task,"um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"like um voice recognition comm right comm "
A,Minor,"um comm "
A,Task,"if it's something which is important then we just add more power "
A,Task,"rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . "
A,Task,"So it's not really a constraint in that sense comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"but I mean these are functionally comm you know comm the base comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"what the technology has to do . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um so I guess the rest of it "
A,Minor,"I think we should "
A,Task,"maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? "
A,Task,"I think that's more relevant to a discussion ? "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"Well comm do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? "
D,Task,"Sure . Sure . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm w I'm done . "
B,Elicit,"Are you are you all done ? "
A,Task,"More or less . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Ps Oh comm it's just putting the rest of it into words comm "
A,Task,"but it's essentially the same thing . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Um you have a transmitter comm an input device comm logic chip comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"you know comm stuff like that . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"And like on the means b "
A,Minor,"I guess this would be "
D,Elicit,"Since we're on the topic of the technology comm uh are there any like what are our options ? "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"Alright comm what's what i in "
D,Elicit,"Is this the only way that we go about it comm or are there other thin "
A,Task,"Um comm these these aren't technology options in that sense . "
D,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"This is just um "
D,Task,"The basic principle of "
A,Task,"a basic principles and basic components that are needed . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"For example comm if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition comm right comm then your user interface would be split comm "
A,Task,"broken down into more components comm right comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"which you have a microphone comm the V_R_ and stuff like that . "
B,Task,"Oh . So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Yep . Yep . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So each component represents one function comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"but I think the basic functions are the logic comm the transmitter comm um and the receiver comm okay comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and the power are things that you won't have to care about . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market comm "
B,Task,"so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface "
B,Task,"and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red comm "
B,Task,"so we could stay with tha "
A,Task,"There might be one other problem with the transmission comm "
A,Task,"um in particular right now comm since we're talking about voice recognition . "
A,Task,"Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device comm you ideally want them to hold it to them . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm "
B,Task,"Oh comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"I it "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"you may not require that comm "
A,Minor,"but you know comm um it's it's "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"it's something very natural comm I guess comm you know comm to hold it comm to signal to the user comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Then you need to send the signal out comm "
A,Task,"so because if you're using infra-red comm the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair comm and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here comm it blocks it . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So in that sense comm there's not really a restriction "
A,Task,"but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Not so much further down . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"And um just a clarification before we finish this . "
D,Elicit,"Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment comm "
D,Elicit,"so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ? "
A,Task,"There's there's not much specific specific information comm "
B,Minor,"W "
A,Task,"but I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Because infra-red is something which everybody has . "
B,Minor,"W Well well we've um "
B,Task,"In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ comm "
D,Task,"Just to T_V_ comm okay . "
B,Task,"so that's what we should do for now I think . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Something I was wondering about was the power . "
B,Task,"Um comm is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? "
B,Elicit,"I mean is that something we really want to go into comm do you think comm "
B,Elicit,"or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? "
A,Minor,"There's a there's "
A,Task,"Okay comm from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity comm "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"and you add cost to it comm "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . "
A,Task,"You need a docking cradle comm for example comm for you to put it in to charge . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Or you need to get the user to plug it in . "
A,Task,"Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries comm "
A,Task,"like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know comm we really need to care about . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so just stick to to regular "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um comm right . "
B,Minor,"So basically the um "
B,Other,"I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start comm "
B,Task,"was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at comm "
B,Task,"and what exactly the product's gonna do . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"So um just to recap on "
B,Elicit,"Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's good . "
B,Task,"Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . "
B,Task,"Do you wanna recap on that comm Craig ? "
C,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . "
C,Task,"Um on off comm up and down channels comm up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . "
B,Task,"Okay comm right . "
C,Minor,"Ta . "
D,Elicit,"And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features comm "
D,Elicit,"or are we gonna eliminate those ? "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"I think we include mute comm "
C,Task,"but apart from that um I think we just we'll go for the simpleness . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm I think "
D,Minor,"R is it is it is it s "
D,Task,"is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's as optional functions . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they comm you know comm w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . "
D,Task,"I dunno if that'd be a problem . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
A,Task,"One would be audio controls comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"one would be video controls comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"and the other one would be a device . "
A,Task,"Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially comm "
A,Task,"but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view comm from a person designing the device comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but I think from a point of view of a person using the device comm you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets comm right comm where we could throw things into comm "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"like if we want this feature comm let's throw it into there comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and then from there decide whether it's basic comm or it's non-basic . "
D,Task,"'Kay comm okay . Like that . "
A,Task,"I mean it might help with the visualisation . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And it would actually help with the component build as well . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Okay comm right . "
D,Task,"Mm okay comm great . "
B,Minor,"Um comm okay well "
B,Task,"I gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now . "
B,Task,"Um next thing we're doing is having lunch . "
B,Other,"Whoohoo . "
B,Task,"Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . "
B,Other,"Um so I'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"um for uh our Industrial Designer comm you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . "
B,Task,"Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface comm "
B,Task,"and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . "
B,Task,"Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well . "
B,Minor,"So um I dunno comm "
B,Elicit,"just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking . "
B,Task,"Um comm do you wanna start with David . "
B,Elicit,"Anything else to say at all ? "
A,Task,"Mm no comm not really . "
B,Task,"No comm okay . "
D,Other,"Um yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"Andrew ? "
D,Other,"just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up comm "
D,Task,"shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed comm "
D,Task,"where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of comm okay comm we're talking about this . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah I think that's definitely a good idea . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"Shall we do that comm then ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay comm great . "
C,Elicit,"Um just about the three buckets comm um what would go in the the device functions one ? "
A,Task,"Um things like on off . "
A,Task,"Because they don't have anything to do with what you see . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value comm "
A,Minor,"you know comm um so um "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And and channel . "
C,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"And channel . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Because the on off also goes comm you know comm like on off like power comm not on off sound . "
A,Task,"Not on off video . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ comm "
A,Task,"but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"say you wanna pick up the phone comm "
A,Minor,"there's a mute button comm right comm "
A,Task,"so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Device is basically anything which we can't categorise comm right . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"We put it out . "
B,Task,"so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"anything to do with what you hear comm right . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"You you put that into audio . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And then video is anything that you can see . "
B,Task,"and then visual "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so brightness comm contrast comm things like that comm "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Colour comm yeah . "
B,Task,"and then just actual device things comm "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"like what channel you're watching comm turning on an off comm "
D,Minor,"Sure . "
D,Minor,"Sure . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"stuff like that . "
B,Task,"Okay comm um "
D,Task,"And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard "
D,Task,"and then others which are maybe a bit more "
A,Task,"Like random which we have no other place to put comm but we need it somewhere there . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Sure comm okay . Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . "
A,Task,"It's easy to use comm I think "
A,Minor,"that's one thing that um "
A,Task,"and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"'cause things are like fixed . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Um so yeah comm I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good comm "
B,Task,"because of who we're we're comm you know comm targeting this at . "
B,Task,"Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"you know comm things like that . "
B,Minor,"Um comm "
B,Task,"so I guess I guess that's it . "
D,Task,"Great . "
B,Task,"That's the meeting over . "
B,Other,"Whoohoo . "
D,Task,"Then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us . "
