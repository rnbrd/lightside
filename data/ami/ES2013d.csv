A,Task,"Um almost comm "
A,Task,"there's one more thing I have to get out of the "
A,Task,"I have to make sure that this attachment will open . "
B,Task,"I keep forgetting whether I've done this . . "
A,Task,"Ah-ha . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We'll open that when the time is right . "
A,Minor,"In the meantime "
A,Task,"Closing things down comm "
A,Task,"okay . "
A,Task,"Let's see what this thing does . "
A,Elicit,"Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? "
A,Minor,"Ah comm "
A,Task,"we came up together comm "
A,Task,"we're good . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Are we ready to start ? "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"It's now quarter of four . "
A,Task,"This is a f another forty minute one "
A,Task,"so it will end at four twenty five . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Right . "
A,Task,"Our agenda is comm as before comm for me to open the meeting comm "
A,Task,"for us to go over the previous minutes comm "
A,Task,"then for the two of you to present your prototype "
A,Task,"and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . "
A,Task,"We then have a finance aspect comm "
A,Task,"which is a spreadsheet comm an Excel spreadsheet . "
A,Task,"And I know what you're all thinking of comm oh my comm "
A,Task,"um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in comm including the production evaluation . "
A,Task,"So we're going to make a very fast track . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um "
A,Task,"and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . "
A,Other,"So the first thing I have to do is close this "
A,Minor,"so that I can get to "
A,Elicit,"Where is it ? "
D,Task,"Red . "
A,Task,"I need to open mine . Not the agenda . "
D,Elicit,"Agenda three . "
A,Task,"No "
A,Minor,"that th "
A,Task,"I want the minutes from the previous minutes . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"That should be there comm minutes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Uh "
A,Task,"from meeting three comm "
A,Elicit,"is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show comm just use it as is ? "
A,Task,"'Cause this way I can more easily flip it . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm um "
A,Task,"obviously all of us were here for the last meeting comm "
A,Task,"we reviewed the previous minutes before that comm "
A,Task,"um each of you made your presentations . "
A,Task,"Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . "
A,Task,"The market trend of fruit and veg comm mm spongy comm uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . "
A,Task,"Um we decided chip on print would be used . "
A,Task,"Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing comm I think was the consensus comm "
A,Task,"powered by kinetic energy . "
A,Task,"There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . "
A,Task,"Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . "
A,Task,"Um looking like a scroll comm "
A,Task,"but it's really a push button technology comm excuse my spelling um that was actually in use comm "
A,Task,"that is uh behind the scenes is push button "
A,Task,"which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . "
A,Task,"Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product "
A,Task,"that could be suggested to management . "
A,Task,"Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo comm a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . "
A,Task,"Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits "
A,Task,"and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints "
A,Task,"and we ran out of time . "
A,Task,"Um we had to follow that up "
A,Task,"and prepare for the last one . "
A,Task,"And uh we closed "
A,Task,"as it ran out of time . "
A,Elicit,"Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"back to this meeting . "
A,Task,"Um we're down to the prototype presentation . "
B,Other,"Ta-da . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Over to you . "
B,Task,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Well . "
A,Task,"Ooh comm "
A,Task,"two . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"well you see comm "
C,Task,"each made one comm "
C,Task,"we didn't have enough yellow dough . "
A,Task,"Ah . "
C,Task,"This is the one that I made . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"It is uh curved comm easy to hold comm hand-held comm nice and small with big easy buttons . "
C,Task,"This is like a scroll comm "
C,Task,"but they are push buttons "
C,Task,"and they enter takes you into the different menus . "
C,Task,"Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television . "
C,Task,"I mean this is the infrared thing "
C,Task,"that's gonna zap at the television . "
C,Task,"Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that comm "
C,Task,"but I'm sure it will work . "
C,Task,"Uh this is on off switch comm "
C,Task,"'cause I think we do need that comm "
C,Task,"and I think it gives it a nice balance . "
C,Task,"And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Um as for what it's actually made of "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"the function of these buttons is up comm down comm left and right in the different menus . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh position comm I presume that just means right right on it comm easy to see . "
C,Task,"The main feature of it is just a simple design comm simple comm "
C,Task,"lack of uh buttons all over the place . "
C,Elicit,"Right ? "
C,Task,"Form curved comm kind of smooth comm hand-held comm "
C,Task,"makes it feel nice to hold . "
C,Task,"Uh material comm I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit comm "
C,Task,"but I think we have two different options comm "
C,Task,"because we did make a another one comm "
C,Task,"which wa uh is in the shape of banana comm "
C,Minor,"it's just "
C,Task,"if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons comm like just like this but in the shape of a banana comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"which is also nice "
C,Task,"and easy to hold "
C,Task,"and feels good "
C,Task,"and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology comm "
C,Task,"just a slightly different design . "
C,Task,"Also with on off switch and infrared "
C,Task,"uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . "
C,Minor,"So like uh well comm "
C,Task,"I dunno comm "
C,Elicit,"what's it like ? "
C,Task,"I guess like an existing remote control comm but molded and smooth . "
C,Minor,"Whereas otherwise we'd thought comm like with this one "
C,Task,"or mix and match comm "
C,Elicit,"just we were gonna see what you thought comm "
C,Minor,"the "
C,Task,"uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we have the two options we can follow comm either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber comm depending on cost restraints . "
C,Minor,"And what we "
C,Minor,"well comm "
C,Other,"what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . "
C,Task,"Uh material yeah comm that's what I have to say about material . "
C,Elicit,"Can I scroll down on there and see what else "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"colour comm I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons comm "
C,Task,"because that's the company colours comm "
C,Elicit,"but if anybody's got any other suggestions comm I'm quite willing to consider them as well . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Elicit,"it just depends what you think about these ideas "
C,Minor,"and if I'm "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"maybe comm Kate comm you better say what you think about them . "
B,Minor,"Um well "
B,Task,"I don't have very much to add . "
B,Minor,"Um the the case "
B,Other,"oops comm "
B,Task,"that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . "
B,Task,"The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . "
B,Task,"We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two comm "
B,Task,"but it can be either of those . "
B,Task,"We have the technology to do that . "
B,Task,"Um and as for the the actual components um comm uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . "
B,Task,"We have simple rubber push buttons "
B,Task,"um which provide all the functionality we need . "
B,Task,"Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end comm "
B,Task,"it's the stalk of the banana comm "
B,Task,"or it's just the thing at the end of this version . "
B,Minor,"Um so "
B,Task,"that's for material . "
B,Task,"Colour comm well uh Steph's the expert on colour . "
B,Task,"Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I think that's all we've got to say really . "
C,Task,"I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme comm I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . "
C,Minor,"This one has n "
B,Task,"A banana . "
C,Task,"banana comm yeah . "
C,Task,"This one has no obvious connections to fruit comm "
C,Task,"but because it's round and molded comm "
C,Task,"it kinda makes you think sort of organic comm touchy-feely comm kiddie comm "
C,Minor,"it's more like "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one comm "
C,Task,"which I quite like that sort of image . "
C,Task,"'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly "
C,Minor,"and "
B,Elicit,"Would you care to examine the prototypes comm see how they feel in the hand ? "
C,Elicit,"Hold them comm "
C,Minor,"you see comm you know . "
C,Elicit,"Curvature comm is it to your liking ? "
A,Task,"Oh I see comm the on-off's in the back . "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . "
C,Task,"If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . "
A,Task,"And then you can use your thumb . "
B,Task,"And it was partly we thought the design looked better comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I could see this thing comm unless it's reinforced comm having a problem with the "
C,Elicit,"Breaking comm "
A,Minor,"you know "
C,Other,"oh right . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well you see comm "
C,Task,"that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it comm "
C,Task,"because then it'd just be rigid . "
D,Task,"I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . "
A,Task,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"It's really kind of a "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we really like we really like that design comm "
C,Task,"I mean it looks just like a logo comm that arrangement of the keys . "
C,Task,"Like a c like a compass point comm "
C,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"just up comm down comm left and right comm "
C,Task,"and we think we could make that quite a good feature . "
C,Task,"And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel comm but better . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But it's also like texting comm "
D,Minor,"you don't "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"I mean it "
C,Task,"that's what it makes me think of comm mobile phones comm "
C,Minor,"I was try "
C,Elicit,"I was thinking comm moving your thumb like this comm what does that remind me of ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And it's a very simple design comm "
C,Task,"It's texting . "
B,Task,"there's not a lot to wrong comm "
B,Task,"the components are cheap to make . "
D,Task,"It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"You know comm "
D,Task,"I I d I have several four remotes comm "
D,Task,"and they all look the same until you get up close "
D,Minor,"and you have to "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Task,"this is really identifiable . "
C,Task,"I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and what sort of comm you know comm text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"but we do definitely think that it's a viable option . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"The next item is evaluation . "
D,Task,"No comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh if that's "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"if you're finished . "
C,Task,"Uh yeah comm we're finished . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"shall I take your uh power ? "
A,Other,"Oh sorry . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Try again . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation comm "
D,Task,"and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Task,"this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers "
D,Task,"a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Other,"I'm going to go and use the whiteboard comm "
D,Task,"and I've made a list of criteria to look at comm "
D,Task,"and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing comm "
D,Task,"but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false comm going over these different criteria comm "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"one true seven false "
D,Other,"and I'm gonna now use the um the board . "
D,Minor,"Okay . So um "
D,Task,"fancy comm technologically innovative comm easy to use comm trendy comm buttons comm excess buttons comm good buttons comm ugly comm sellable comm and other . "
D,Task,"And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms comm "
D,Task,"because these are things that um have been brought up comm "
D,Task,"some of them seem rather close comm "
D,Task,"like they overlap . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"what about price comm is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials . "
D,Task,"Mm comm yeah comm price . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Other,"We'll put price up at the top . "
C,Task,"Not that we actually know anything about it comm "
C,Task,"but we can we can pretend . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"we will soon comm "
A,Task,"unfortunately . "
D,Minor,"Um Okay comm so "
A,Task,"Come on . "
D,Other,"Did you say ? "
A,Task,"No comm . "
D,Other,"Uh okay comm "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Elicit,"wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? "
C,Task,"It depends what what you mean by fancy really comm "
C,Task,"'cause when I think of fancy comm I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and comm you know comm like baroque curliness "
C,Minor,"and which "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"I'd call these quite uh minimalist comm "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"a plain comm simple comm clean design . "
C,Task,"simple and plain comm "
C,Minor,"but I mean I do see what "
C,Task,"it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"so in that respect it is quite fancy . "
D,Minor,"I "
D,Minor,"yeah comm so "
D,Minor,"in that respect "
D,Task,"I think we'll go with that respect . "
C,Task,"I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I'd say maybe aesthetic . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"we have got s trendy further down comm "
A,Elicit,"Elegant . "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"Elegant . "
D,Minor,"Elegant . "
B,Task,"Elegant comm I don't know if I'd call them elegant . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"no "
D,Minor,"these aren't the exact terms that the um "
C,Elicit,"like stylish or aesthetic . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Stylish comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Elegant . We're gon let's use elegant comm "
D,Task,"although the the the people comm the word on the street is is "
C,Task,"Fancy . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"N that um "
C,Elicit,"Did you just break the pen ? "
D,Task,"yeah "
D,Task,"uh the uh is fancy . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"let's let's take it to the next level . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"d "
C,Task,"we'll just call it fancy then . "
D,Minor,"Well okay comm so "
D,Elicit,"in terms of elegant comm fancy . we'll call it E_F_ um comm do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ? "
D,Elicit,"Should we go with the yellow "
D,Minor,"in terms of "
D,Task,"I think that's a really superior "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I think we n we need to "
D,Minor,"they're both "
C,Task,"they're both yellow with black buttons comm "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that comm "
C,Task,"but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"that isn't "
C,Task,"that is more curved comm like a banana comm "
C,Task,"but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana comm you know comm with the grooves and the stalk and stuff comm "
D,Minor,"As a banana . "
D,Task,"I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . "
C,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And of the two I really like I m I like the banana comm "
D,Task,"but I I do like the chunk . "
A,Task,"The chunk . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now comm "
D,Task,"No comm "
C,Elicit,"is it . "
D,Minor,"but I mean in terms "
C,Task,"Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . "
D,Task,"we have to evaluate one of them . "
D,Elicit,"Unless do you guys wanna evaluate both ? "
A,Task,"I think between the two comm somewhere between the two is true . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"I'd "
A,Task,"It's more true than false comm about a two . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"we say true . "
D,Elicit,"technologically innovative . "
B,Task,"I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"we'll say we'll say uh false . "
D,Elicit,"Easy to use . "
B,Task,"Very . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Elicit,"One comm "
D,Elicit,"is that inappropriate ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Oh comm pardon me . Um "
A,Elicit,"Trendy . "
D,Elicit,"trendy comm s and I say specifically spongy fruity . "
C,Task,"Oh yes . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"maybe only a two or a three then comm "
C,Minor,"'cause it's no "
C,Task,"we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific "
B,Task,"We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"I think "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I don't really think that's gonna work comm "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so "
C,Minor,"but "
D,Elicit,"two ? Um "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Excess buttons . "
D,Elicit,"are there excess buttons ? "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"So that's false . "
D,Task,"That is false . "
D,Elicit,"Um good comm well designed buttons comm intuitive buttons . "
A,Task,"Better comm more intuitive buttons comm yes . "
D,Task,"True . "
D,Elicit,"Ugly . "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"People don't respond well to ugly . "
D,Elicit,"Sellable comm uh quirky comm "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Minor,"something people "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I think they're different comm "
D,Minor,"like "
D,Minor,"oh comm "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"it is quite it is quite quirky I think . "
B,Elicit,"aren't they ? "
A,Task,"I like it . "
D,Task,"yeah . Yeah comm I do too . "
C,Task,"It could be quite a good brand comm like a good little object . "
D,Task,"Oh yeah . "
D,Other,"And I was I was thinking of other things "
D,Minor,"um in terms of "
D,Elicit,"uh could we say it's cost saving ? "
D,Minor,"With the "
C,Minor,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"we also need tho think about the energy . "
C,Elicit,"Is it the kinetic energy ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm with the energy . "
C,Minor,"If it's "
B,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"It is going to be kinetic ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . "
D,Minor,"Uh so "
D,Task,"yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet comm "
C,Task,"so we're not completely sure about that comm "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"you're still in the Play-Doh stage . "
C,Minor,"but "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Anything else ? Including price comm "
D,Elicit,"do you have any idea about price or other features ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . "
B,Task,"We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yes comm the instinct says true . "
D,Elicit,"So true one "
D,Elicit,"or should I go to two or three ? "
B,Task,"I'd put it at one I think comm "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I dunno comm "
C,Task,"I would say maybe a two comm "
B,Elicit,"what do you "
C,Task,"'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm true comm "
C,Task,"I mean it's not just like I mean it's not like ev you know comm on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different comm "
B,Minor,"it might be the "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"that's not a cheap thing to get . "
B,Task,"yeah comm yeah comm true . "
B,Minor,"True . "
C,Task,"whereas this one has only got the four buttons "
C,Task,"and they all they mean everything comm depending on what menu you're in . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's a good point . "
C,Task,"uh we need somebody to develop that . "
D,Elicit,"Um other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ? "
D,Other,"And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these "
D,Minor,"so then I'm gonna "
D,Other,"instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive "
D,Other,"and then make that true comm "
D,Minor,"so that "
D,Task,"'cause I have to do an average . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Right . "
D,Other,"And then um excess buttons . "
C,Task,"Just putting no excess buttons . "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
D,Task,"Wow we're doing really well . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"be "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Task,"so it doesn't ruin the polarity . "
C,Minor,"As for "
C,Task,"see if we're technologically innovative comm I'd say it is quite innovative comm "
C,Task,"because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition "
C,Task,"but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . "
D,Task,"Or L_C_D_ . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"if you g uh "
D,Elicit,"let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . "
D,Other,"If not I'll average those . "
A,Task,"I think we're good . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"We're a little over halfway through the meeting "
A,Task,"and the next big thing is the finance . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Um okay comm "
D,Other,"how about if I uh pass this back to you "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Other,"and I'll uh figure out the average here . "
A,Task,"Right . "
D,Other,"Thank you for everyone's help with that . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"And as you can see it says the same thing comm "
A,Task,"it had not lost itself comm "
A,Task,"thank Goodness . "
A,Other,"And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet "
A,Task,"that they provided to me . "
A,Minor,"Um and "
A,Task,"it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . "
A,Task,"Hand dynamo comm battery comm kinetic comm solar cells . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"just kinetic then comm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Um what's a hand dynamo ? "
B,Task,"That was the crank comm wind-up crank on the side . "
C,Task,"It's the wind-up . "
A,Other,"Oh "
A,Other,"shoot comm "
A,Task,"forget that . "
A,Minor,"Kinetic is um "
A,Elicit,"and how many of those will we need per "
B,Task,"Just one . "
A,Task,"we only need one . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Electronic simple chip on print comm and we'll need one of those . "
B,Task,"Uh uh yeah comm I think we can do it all with simple "
B,Other,"Just checking that . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm simple comm "
B,Task,"'cause we've just got push buttons comm "
B,Task,"so we can do it all with simple "
B,Task,"which is the ch should be the cheapest . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"and we only need one of those . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . "
A,Task,"It looks like it single curve comm "
A,Task,"'cause of th the chunkiness . "
A,Minor,"It's "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that that one is single curve comm "
A,Task,"that's uh uh one . "
B,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
B,Minor,"Um do we have "
C,Elicit,"What does double curved mean comm I don't understand . "
A,Minor,"And that's "
B,Task,"I I think you it means you reverse the curve . "
A,Task,"uh that's the the one that goes like this . "
C,Other,"Oh "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm I do I don't think we need that for either of them comm "
C,Task,"no comm we don't need that . No . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"you can do a banana in single curve comm "
C,Task,"Single-curved comm I'd say . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"single curve . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"case material supplements . Plastic comm wood comm rubber comm titanium comm special colour . "
C,Minor,"I "
C,Task,"I just wanna say plastic . "
A,Task,"We had the special colour . "
A,Elicit,"And did we say plastic ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"can we do some what ifs comm "
B,Minor,"'cause it may "
D,Other,"One comm two comm three comm four comm five comm six . "
B,Task,"I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but it depends on the cost comm I guess . "
A,Task,"Okay . We'll come back comm if we can comm to the rubber being added "
A,Task,"at the moment comm that's where we are . "
A,Elicit,"Interface button push button interface . That's what we're using comm "
C,Task,"It's just button . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
B,Task,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Do we need to say how many buttons comm "
B,Minor,"or "
A,Task,"Whoops comm "
A,Other,"don't want that comm not yet . Um "
B,Elicit,"or d is it just one ? "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"it just says push button interface . "
A,Task,"Button supplements comm they'll be in a special colour of black . "
B,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of comm rubber ? "
B,Task,"Uh they'll be rubber comm yep . "
A,Task,"So we need one of them . "
A,Elicit,"And are they any special form ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"like the compass point one . "
B,Minor,"Actually comm "
B,Elicit,"does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? "
B,Task,"'Cause I think they can be plastic . "
A,Task,"'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . "
B,Task,"Yeah . They could be plastic comm "
B,Task,"we don't have to have rubber buttons comm "
B,Task,"because we haven't got a double curved case . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm they could be plastic . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um "
A,Task,"let's put that rubber in then comm of the case material supplement . "
B,Task,"It's just one comm "
B,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
A,Task,"Uh we only need one of them . "
A,Task,"Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . "
B,Task,"What comm we're in . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We're in . "
A,Other,"That's us . "
B,Task,"More profit . "
C,Task,"Great . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"I'm going to save this into our desktop comm project documents . Okay . As our project document bit . "
B,Elicit,"Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"There we are . "
A,Task,"That's the only Excel document that will be in there comm "
A,Task,"so it's there for all of us . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so comm "
A,Elicit,"are they under twelve fifty ? "
A,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Other,"go to the project evaluation comm next slide . "
A,Minor,"Right . Um "
A,Task,"the project process comm satisfaction with comm for example comm the room for creativity . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"leadership comm "
D,Task,"Sure . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"teamwork comm "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"means comm of having whiteboard comm the digital pens and all that kind of good things . "
C,Elicit,"And Play-Doh . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm the Play-Doh was best comm I thought . "
C,Minor,"Yeah well comm "
C,Task,"'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying comm well we quite want this comm but imagine it rounder . "
C,Task,"So much better just to go and comm you know comm this is it comm this is what we want . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So comm "
A,Task,"we went over all those things "
A,Task,"and we're satisfied with all the above . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
A,Elicit,"Um did we find any new ideas ? "
D,Task,"I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Spongy . "
D,Task,"I I only speak for myself though . "
C,Task,"And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so . "
C,Task,"Good work as a design team comm "
C,Minor,"because we "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think we're a good team actually . "
B,Task,"I'm not sure all the wires are really great though . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we actually worked well as a group . "
B,Task,"I thought so . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"Are the costs within the budget ? "
C,Task,"Oh yes . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"Is the project evaluated ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Other,"I can give you a number comm "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Task,"hang on comm "
B,Task,"we haven't heard . "
D,Minor,"um it's uh "
A,Other,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"the average evaluation score is one point eight eight comm "
D,Minor,"so it means w "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Other,"I can I can spell it out . "
D,Task,"There were six true or ones comm "
D,Minor,"four "
D,Other,"um pardon me comm "
D,Task,"two s almost true or close to true comm "
D,Task,"so that was four points comm "
D,Task,"and then uh one false comm seven points comm "
D,Task,"so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two . "
D,Task,"I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology comm "
D,Task,"To maintain old technology comm "
D,Task,"exactly . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Absolutely comm "
B,Task,"and it's kept us within budget . "
C,Minor,"so . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So we do count as I think excellent or one . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary comm "
C,Minor,". "
A,Task,"I have a final report to present comm "
A,Task,"um and then we're done . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We done good comm "
C,Other,"Bring on the ice sculptures . "
A,Task,"and we're finished in time . "
D,Other,"Nice . "
B,Task,"And then we get the product launch party . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"we might have to wait . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Product launch party ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's what I said comm ice sculptures . "
B,Task,"Absolutely . "
D,Minor,"Um I one thing I want to do is "
D,Minor,"oh comm "
D,Task,"I think the meeting's done . "
A,Task,"I believe that is the end of our meeting . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Thank you comm Melissa . "
D,Other,"Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files comm "
