B,Minor,"Okay comm well "
B,Task,"I think we're ready to begin . "
B,Minor,"Right comm "
B,Task,"my name's Adam Duguid comm "
B,Task,"we're here because of real reaction comm "
B,Elicit,"um comm we have in the group "
C,Other,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"Ebenezer Ademesoye . "
C,Elicit,"Would you like me to spell that ? "
C,Minor,"S "
B,Task,"Um comm yeah comm "
B,Task,"go for it mate . "
C,Task,"Um comm N_E_Z_ "
B,Other,"N_ E_ Z_ . "
C,Task,"E_R_ . "
B,Other,"Ebenezer . "
B,Elicit,"And your role is ? "
C,Task,"I'm the Marketing Expert . "
B,Other,"You're the Marketing Expert comm okay . "
B,Elicit,"Next we have ? "
D,Task,"Tarik Rahman . T_A_R_I_K_ . "
B,Other,"T_ R_ I_ K_ . "
B,Elicit,"And your role in this is ? "
D,Task,"Industrial Designer . "
B,Other,"Industrial Designer . "
B,Elicit,"And comm lastly we have ? "
A,Task,"Uh comm Dave Cochrane . "
B,Task,"And you're going to be the User Interface comm "
A,Task,"User Interface Defin Designer comm yes . "
B,Elicit,"is it ? "
B,Other,"Designer . Okay . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see comm w opening comm acquaintance comm tool training comm project plan discussion comm and closing . "
B,Task,"Um comm we already got n through opening comm and partially through acquaintance . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"the reason we're here comm we're gonna design a new remote control comm "
B,Task,"as you probably all know . "
B,Task,"The very broad overview is original comm trendy comm and user-friendly . "
B,Task,"Course comm we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that comm "
B,Task,"but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . "
B,Task,"Um comm there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway comm "
B,Task,"so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . "
B,Task,"This is how today seems to be going to work . "
B,Task,"We're gonna have the three kay phases comm "
B,Task,"as you've probably already been told comm "
B,Task,"the functional comm architectural comm and the detailed design . Um "
B,Task,"First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec comm technical functions comm working design . "
B,Task,"Second seems to be conceptual components comm properties comm materials comm "
B,Task,"and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . "
B,Task,"Of course comm you've all got the similar emails comm I believe comm "
B,Elicit,"right . "
B,Task,"What can I say ? "
B,Elicit,"Ebenezer comm you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal ? "
C,Task,"Sure . "
C,Other,"Whiteboard . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Minor,"S "
C,Minor,"okay . "
C,Other,"I will make this quick comm "
C,Task,"since we don't have much time . "
C,Minor,"Um . 'Kay comm so "
C,Task,"it's not the best picture in the world . "
C,Task,"Here we have an elephant . "
C,Task,"First point comm begins with an E_ comm same like Ebenezer . "
C,Task,"Also comm elephants have a very good memory comm much like myself comm "
C,Task,"and I can't remember "
C,Task,"back when I used to live back in Nigeria comm "
C,Task,"but I think I used to have a pet elephant . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"elephants are big comm strong and gentle comm "
C,Task,"and they have great memories comm "
C,Task,"and they begin with the letter E_ comm just like Ebenezer . "
B,Other,"Brilliantly done . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Elicit,"Tarik comm would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ? "
D,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"Oh . Oh oh "
B,Minor,"Oh comm um comm "
B,Task,"you can clip them to your belt . "
D,Elicit,"Do we take them off ? "
C,Minor,"I think you ga "
D,Other,"Oh right comm "
D,Task,"okay . "
B,Task,"You should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well . "
C,Minor,"The little "
D,Other,"Ah-ha . "
C,Minor,"The the "
C,Task,"Oh that's good comm "
C,Task,"we can clip them on . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Now "
D,Elicit,"where do I put the "
C,Task,"Just um somewhere "
B,Task,"Yep comm "
B,Task,"the comm it's just across there comm "
B,Task,"that's it . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Elicit,"Is this supposed to be clipped as well ? "
C,Task,"I think so . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It'll follow you "
B,Minor,"if you "
C,Task,"Yeah . There you go . "
B,Task,"You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now comm "
B,Other,"I wouldn't worry too much . "
B,Task,"Should have good range . "
D,Task,"Uh comm destroying your elephant here . "
D,Task,"Uh comm here we have a tiger . Uh "
D,Task,"I've always loved tigers . "
D,Minor,"They're just "
D,Task,"they're big comm they're biggest cats comm "
D,Task,"uh I did a project on cats in the wild "
D,Task,"when I was a kid "
D,Task,"and uh it was my favourite cat comm "
D,Task,"just 'cause it was looks the best comm the stripes comm orange . "
D,Task,"My dad used to talk about "
D,Task,"he's from Bangladesh "
D,Task,"so he used to tell me all about them "
D,Minor,"when he was "
D,Task,"when I was a kid . "
D,Task,"And uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild . "
D,Minor,"So uh "
D,Task,"that's why I like them . "
D,Task,"Didn't say an anything about me really "
D,Minor,"but "
B,Other,"Excellent comm "
B,Other,"thank you very much . "
B,Task,"Dave comm if you'd like to uh have a dash . "
A,Task,"Um Um comm the monkey comm um . "
A,Minor,"The one f uh "
A,Task,"in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference "
A,Minor,"in fact to "
A,Minor,"uh well "
A,Minor,"my "
A,Task,"I have a three uh three y year old daughter "
A,Task,"who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey . "
A,Task,"Um comm monkeys have attitude . "
A,Task,"Which I think is a good thing . "
A,Task,"And I mean fr and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . "
A,Task,"Um comm so I like monkeys . "
A,Task,"And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most . "
B,Other,"Cheers . "
B,Task,"Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world "
B,Task,"but it'll do for now . "
B,Task,"Also not quite as feared as your average tiger comm "
B,Task,"but uh cats are one of my favourite animals comm "
B,Task,"they're very independent comm "
B,Task,"they're snotty as hell at the best of times comm "
B,Task,"and uh comm what can you say comm you got to love those qualities in an animal . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it comm "
B,Minor,"so comm "
B,Task,"on to it . "
B,Task,"Project finance . As you can see comm twelve point five Euros per unit . "
B,Task,"That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware comm "
B,Task,"and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . "
B,Task,"If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . "
C,Minor,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"that was profiting comm "
C,Task,"that was an amount comm so that's the amount made comm "
B,Task,"Yep . "
C,Other,"okay . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"fifty million comm "
B,Task,"and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one comm then comm awful lot need to be sold . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . "
B,Elicit,"Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"one thing I'm aware of is comm th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes "
A,Task,"that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models comm "
A,Minor,"so you get the sort of you get um you "
A,Task,"you can redesign the interface to your own needs comm "
A,Task,"you can programme in macros comm "
A,Minor,"and you get a much greater degree "
A,Task,"um um I mean you get in these sort of three in one comm five in one comm whatevers comm "
A,Task,"but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control comm to a much greater extent comm "
A,Task,"and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel comm get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound comm for instance . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . "
A,Task,"And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"yeah comm tha that's true comm "
B,Task,"with the price range we're looking at comm going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our "
A,Task,"Absolutely prohibitive comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
B,Elicit,"But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I mean I wouldn't like to say you g "
A,Task,"I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units comm "
A,Task,"but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . "
A,Minor,"Some "
A,Task,"and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros . "
B,Elicit,"Would the the idea something along the lines of comm one on button would turn on say the video recorder comm the T_V_ comm maybe the sound system as well comm all in one go comm is that kind of "
A,Task,"For instance comm "
A,Minor,"um let's say oh oh um comm or um you know "
A,Task,"you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well comm um "
B,Task,"Okay comm that sounds like a a good strong idea . Um "
C,Minor,"'Kay "
B,Elicit,"Any takes on this ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television comm "
C,Task,"um when I was younger "
C,Task,"we used to e play games using our cable comm using the cable subscribed the cable providers comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"but our remote controls would get worn out really easily comm "
C,Task,"and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar comm um keypad comm for playing games . "
C,Task,"So perhaps one that was more um "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"specialised for game playing or interactive television . "
C,Task,"They they've recently brought out this new remote control comm "
C,Task,"for people to set their favourite channels comm or um to record things . "
C,Task,"Instead of people entering in what time things start comm you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins comm "
C,Task,"and slide another bar to say what time it ends comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"you know that's "
B,Other,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"I've heard "
B,Task,"I've seen the bar-code design before comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Other,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"it's it's taken out the "
C,Task,"Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . "
C,Task,"I think for gaming comm you know you want you want some big buttons for up comm down comm left and right comm shoot . "
C,Task,"Uh comm you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television comm "
C,Task,"so you need buttons to change the television angle comm the camera angles and stuff like that . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm well "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"we're beginning to run out of time now comm "
B,Minor,"so comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"we've got a couple of ideas comm "
B,Minor,"we can "
B,Task,"we'll have to work fast comm "
B,Minor,"um comm alright "
B,Task,"as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting comm "
B,Task,"so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality comm "
B,Task,"um comm how the user interface might work comm "
B,Task,"that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility "
B,Task,"because you have to program it comm "
B,Task,"you have to have a lot of response back comm or at least some kind . Um "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out "
C,Task,"What the user wants uh . "
B,Task,"what the user wants comm yes . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um comm right . "
B,Elicit,"Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage comm anything they think that might have been missed so far ? "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"when you're talking about gaming and stuff comm "
D,Elicit,"do you think they should have some sort of stick on it comm rather than buttons ? "
C,Other,"Oh . Okay comm . "
D,Task,"Like uh control pads comm you know of games comm "
D,Minor,"but "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"or is that a bit ridiculous ? "
B,Task,"I I don't see why not comm "
B,Task,"almost everybody is probably used to a console by now comm "
B,Task,"and all of them incorporate small keypads on them comm "
B,Task,"in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well comm "
B,Task,"so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . Um "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and that could allow n easy navigation comm used as a joystick as well . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic comm "
A,Task,"something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . "
A,Task,"But of course comm uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall comm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Elicit,"small comm stylish comm and something that's just a little different . "
A,Minor,"A curve comm "
A,Task,"mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form comm "
A,Task,"uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily . "
B,Other,"I would I would have hoped so anyway . "
B,Minor,"Um comm right . "
B,Task,"I'd say we finish this one up comm "
B,Task,"we get started comm "
B,Minor,"I'll get in comm "
B,Other,"I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done comm "
B,Other,"and I'll get that out to everybody . "
C,Other,"'Kay . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Other,"So . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Minor,". "
B,Task,"Um comm as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here comm um unless we get told otherwise comm "
B,Task,"and just take the laptops with us . "
