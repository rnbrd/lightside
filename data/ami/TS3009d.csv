A,Task,"Uh fourth meeting . "
B,Elicit,"We have to do what ? "
A,Task,"Some extra deciding . "
C,Other,"W what ? Alri alright . We'll see . "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Other,"I'll show you the notes again . "
A,Task,"Very interesting . "
A,Task,"Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Then um I guess that's your bit ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I I didn't s see anything about it comm "
A,Task,"so I already uh thought you uh you were to do that . "
A,Task,"So the you're uh . "
A,Task,"I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's important too . Yeah . "
A,Task,"And then we'll evaluate comm after after we have redesigned it . "
B,Task,"Bit late . "
A,Task,"Because uh well we'll see about the costs . "
A,Task,"Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production "
A,Task,"and then uh we can close . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Well the finance uh we'll do later comm "
A,Other,"so um firstly uh I'll show you the notes . "
A,Task,"I don't think it's very interesting . "
B,Task,"I think it is . "
A,Task,"Oh nei . Uh no . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"This is copy paste . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"From me of course comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Of course . "
A,Task,"You had some very strange layout . "
C,Task,"Well from us all comm yeah comm from all of us . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's a nice chorus comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well um "
A,Task,"We ge we went through the agenda comm "
A,Task,"and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . "
A,Task,"And uh I summarised what you said to us . "
A,Task,"So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again . "
C,Task,"Repeat it yeah . Alright . "
A,Minor,"So uh "
A,Task,"This is what we decided . "
A,Task,"It's also copy paste from what we made together . "
A,Task,"So we still know that . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . "
A,Task,"Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us . "
C,Task,"Alright comm we both uh will ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Or one of us will ? "
B,Task,"Alright . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"No you go "
B,Other,"and I'll uh supplement you . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
C,Task,"If I make mistakes uh you'll uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Correct . "
C,Minor,"Right . Uh well "
C,Task,"this is our design . "
C,Task,"Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . "
C,Task,"With uh the different uh perspectives of it . "
C,Task,"Uh we'll begin uh with the front . "
C,Task,"We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . "
C,Task,"Um with uh the upper part being the front . "
C,Task,"Th So there's this part um which is made of hard plastic comm the front . "
C,Task,"And uh we're we're using different colours . "
C,Task,"Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours comm "
C,Task,"and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But basically comm different colours comm bright colours not black comm too dark . Fancy colours . "
C,Task,"Um then we have uh the lower part of the of the device . "
C,Task,"Uh which is of course um part of the back actually comm "
C,Task,"because it's also titanium . "
C,Task,"You can see it also on the on the on the side view comm "
C,Task,"that only this part is the front comm "
C,Task,"and the rest of it comm the under uh the under side uh of it comm yeah comm the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium comm "
C,Task,"and has the titanium colour of course comm the look . "
C,Task,"Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back comm part of the titanium uh titanium part . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's a double R_ comm but "
C,Other,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"It's a double R_ . "
C,Task,"It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo "
B,Task,"But it's very difficult to to draw that in Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm alright . "
C,Task,"but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . "
C,Task,"Then we have the buttons . "
C,Task,"Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round "
C,Task,"I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . "
B,Task,"Oval yeah . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"So uh oval comm n those are here . "
C,Minor,"And then we have the m "
C,Minor,"The m "
B,Task,"Channel up and volume ? "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"the the con the the the comm yeah comm the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . "
C,Task,"Um um with kind of arrow shapes comm "
C,Task,"which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh uh square buttons . "
C,Task,"And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . "
C,Task,"We have the Okay button . "
C,Task,"Oh nei "
C,Task,"we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators comm of the channel and uh volume um changers . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And then we've here the Menu button "
C,Minor,"and the "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
B,Task,"Menu for the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Task,"And the video button . "
C,Minor,"The "
D,Minor,"Mm right . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And of course this low part comm this is the L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"Uh this is what we made of it . "
C,Elicit,"You can make uh suggestions uh if you want . "
A,Task,"Well if I look at it comm the side the side view "
B,Minor,"Well comm at the back "
C,Task,"Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and then you can add suggestions . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah alright . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Maybe I I don't want to I don't want to suppress you "
C,Task,"but n I'll uh finish this uh quick . "
C,Task,"Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ? "
B,Task,"No the back . "
B,Task,"With the logo and our uh l uh "
C,Task,"Yeah the back . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"We thought about "
C,Task,"Yeah comm uh the back is of course totally titanium . "
C,Task,"And we thought about the logo big in the middle . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Just so again the double R_ . "
C,Task,"We have then the logo on front and on the back . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Maybe that's too much "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . "
B,Task,"No I don't think "
C,Task,"And the company slogan comm we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . "
B,Minor,"And the "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's basically what we were thinking about comm "
C,Minor,"and "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"And about the side view um This the front won't be as thick comm "
A,Minor,"W "
B,Task,"but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh "
A,Other,"Well I see comm but "
C,Task,"Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice comm of course comm "
A,Other,"Well . Yeah I see it . "
C,Task,"the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"And you can record it uh using comm yeah comm the the the back of the f w device . "
A,Task,"When I look at uh when I look at this side view comm I think w when I have that in my hand comm it's terrible . "
B,Task,"Well comm it won't be visible . "
B,Minor,"Mm ? "
A,Task,"If if you look if if this this is thick comm and this is thin comm th th then it that it lies over your hands . But "
C,Elicit,"Why ? "
C,Task,"Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand comm "
C,Minor,"mean uh the the the the "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
A,Task,"Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle comm so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker comm so th then it falls over your hands . "
B,Minor,"If y "
B,Task,"If you handle a remote comm you you usually don't have your hand straight like this . "
C,Task,"In the middle in the "
B,Task,"You you have it a bit uh Yeah . "
D,Task,"It depends on the size . "
D,Task,"If it's kinda small comm this is is great . "
D,Task,"But if it's it's larger comm then you want to grab it . "
A,Elicit,"And how large is it ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's the question . "
C,Task,"That's the question . "
C,Minor,"Uh well Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"H What do you suggest I mean we do ? "
C,Task,"This was Mike's prototype comm "
A,Minor,"Well uh "
C,Task,"and y you seemed to agreed on it . "
C,Task,"But now you have a totally different . "
A,Task,"Well the sides I haven't seen yet comm uh ? "
B,Task,"Well comm they lay there all the time . "
C,Elicit,"The size ? "
C,Task,"Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean "
A,Task,"They the the the the the side view comm "
C,Other,"Side ? "
C,Other,"Uh oh the side ? "
A,Minor,"we didn't uh "
C,Task,"W we we he drew the s the side comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"but you d you weren't paying attention as usual . "
C,Task,"Well any case comm we'll discuss it now . "
C,Task,"Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Task,"You have it in your palm like this comm and you can watch uh watch the screen . "
D,Task,"And if you have it li in the middle comm your hand might be over it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But you you hold it like this . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"you you don't you don't grab it comm "
C,Task,"You're not holding it like this or something . "
B,Minor,"you you "
C,Other,"You comm yeah comm y How do you call it ? Yeah . "
C,Task,"Well y y y you don't have it like this . "
C,Task,"You have it more like this . "
A,Minor,"No no no . "
C,Task,"You you you're using buttons this way comm "
C,Task,"or if you're right-handed comm this way . "
D,Task,"Like you're holding your telephone . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So you Yeah . So "
D,Task,"Because if you have a screen on it comm you wanna look at your screen . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah well "
B,Task,"That way comm it it falls into your hand . I think . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I agree on this . "
C,Task,"And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher comm "
C,Minor,"so Well "
D,Task,"No comm I don't think so . "
D,Task,"That's not uh the point "
B,Minor,"No but but "
C,Task,"Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side comm but "
B,Task,"Well f for as far as I can see comm three of us agree "
B,Task,"and only Nils "
A,Minor,"Yeah well "
A,Task,"uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it . "
B,Task,"But you're the Project Manager comm "
B,Task,"you can make the hard decisions . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"So uh I c I c "
C,Task,"If necessary . "
C,Elicit,"But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh "
A,Task,"Well comm we'll we we'll do it like this . "
B,Other,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Alright comm if you think that that's the way it should "
C,Minor,"Y Yeah comm "
C,Task,"y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . "
A,Task,"No No comm "
C,Minor,"But do you "
A,Task,"when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick "
A,Minor,"But In the market uh "
C,Task,"But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think . "
A,Task,"No not totally . "
C,Task,"Not totally comm well "
A,Task,"For me comm I I wouldn't buy it . "
A,Task,"Let's say it like that . "
C,Task,"Yeah but of course "
C,Task,"y you are also human . "
C,Task,"We have to take uh every everyone into account . So "
A,Minor,"No "
D,Task,"And you might be uh You might be target customer . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Well uh who who else thinks like you ? "
A,Minor,"Yes but "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"We don't know . "
C,Task,"Maybe a thousand people comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we don't know comm "
A,Task,"but that's uh that's that's that's more market research . "
C,Task,"or a million people . "
A,Task,"So let it be like this at uh at this moment . "
C,Other,"Let it be . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
C,Task,"So that's that . "
C,Elicit,"Uh any other suggestions ? "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"I think it's great . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"But what about the redesigning ? "
A,Task,"Comes to that later . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um you . Uh c You can uh Walter . You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ? "
C,Task,"You're very personal again . "
D,Task,"Alright . Great . "
A,Task,"That's more useful than just speaking . "
D,Task,"Well comm this is just a short intro . "
D,Task,"I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . "
D,Task,"So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . "
D,Task,"Well comm I put some questions in a Word file . "
D,Other,"See if I can find them . "
D,Minor,"Uh uh uh uh mm . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation comm "
D,Task,"so uh I don't have to explain it . "
D,Task,"Uh the first question is comm uh is the device good-looking ? "
D,Task,"Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . "
D,Task,"Seventy five percent of them . "
D,Elicit,"So what do we think ? "
C,Task,"Well d we designed it comm "
C,Task,"so of course we are very "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we're we're not quite uh objective about this . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"No comm I know comm "
B,Task,"Well we designed it to be good-looking . "
D,Task,"but I have to uh evaluate it . "
D,Task,"So I have to take this questionnaire . "
C,Elicit,"So and we ha we have answer now ? "
A,Task,"To the customers ? "
A,Task,"To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? "
D,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but I can't can s "
A,Other,"Nei . Oh no . I know comm I know comm I know . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"But um Well we can go comm uh because of the time comm uh pretty quick through this . "
A,Elicit,"Uh do we find it good-looking ? "
A,Task,"Well we think so . Uh "
C,Minor,"I Yeah comm I think it "
B,Task,"Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking comm so "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but uh comm you know We dis we di we designed it to be perfect . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So But we have to be critic critical about it . "
D,Task,"And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . "
D,Task,"So we we know where we stand . "
A,Task,"Well comm one . "
D,Task,"'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten . "
A,Task,"Well so it's point four . "
D,Task,"Right comm so "
A,Task,"Easy to find t "
C,Task,"Well l well let's start with the beginning comm just one by one . "
D,Task,"Right . "
D,Elicit,"Uh is it good-looking ? "
C,Task,"Well comm I guess uh I think uh it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course comm uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . "
A,Task,"Two . "
C,Task,"That was our target audience of course . "
C,Task,"But it's also not completely um uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . "
C,Minor,"Uh it's it's not f a device that "
D,Task,"The titanium might be uh f for older people . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's that's uh for older people comm "
C,Task,"it's it's more that classical look . So "
D,Task,"It you put uh put a black front on it or something . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh no . "
C,Minor,"I think "
C,Task,"Yeah they like black of course comm "
C,Task,"but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also Uh I think it's also good for them comm "
C,Task,"so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . "
C,Task,"So I think it's very good-looking "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"and not only for youth uh young people . "
B,Task,"I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long comm "
B,Task,"because I don't know how how many points there are but uh "
D,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"No . I totally agree . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm the fourteen yeah . "
A,Task,"We we have to get get on comm go through this . "
D,Elicit,"Right comm a number please . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Is it easy to t change channels ? "
C,Task,"Yeah well I think so . "
D,Task,"So the last one is seven . "
D,Elicit,"Easy to change channels ? "
B,Task,"Um comm no it's uh "
A,Task,"No comm not false . "
A,Task,"It's one . "
D,Other,"Oh comm sorry . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm right . "
A,Elicit,"Well uh two ? "
D,Elicit,"Change channels ? "
A,Task,"Y Well we have to go through it . "
C,Task,"I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Minor,"So I Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"You How can you make it any easier ? "
D,Elicit,"The power comm channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? "
B,Task,"With two huge buttons . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm huge is a Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Two . "
D,Other,"Two ? "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Elicit,"The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? "
A,Task,"Well comm no . "
C,Task,"D we d we don't we don't have uh that s "
A,Task,"We didn't implement anything about that . "
B,Task,"Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something comm "
B,Task,"because of the colour . But "
A,Task,"Well six then . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Six ? Right . "
C,Task,"Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so comm "
A,Elicit,"Are the functions easy to learn ? "
C,Minor,"but um um "
A,Minor,"Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an "
B,Task,"We have so few functions comm "
B,Task,"so Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
A,Elicit,"And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ? "
B,Task,"Well comm I should I think two comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"because the voice recorder is n not self learning . "
A,Minor,"Ah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Alright . Two ? "
C,Minor,"Mm ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but just do some We we "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Elicit,"Are we take too much time ? "
A,Task,"I th I th I think this is too time consuming . "
A,Task,"Uh not not towards you comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"but towards this all . "
A,Minor,"Th this is "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right comm "
A,Task,"We you have to put it to the customers . "
D,Elicit,"R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? "
D,Elicit,"R_S_I_ sensitive ? "
A,Task,"Uh well well a bit comm "
A,Task,"so four . "
D,Task,"Four . "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm very much . "
C,Task,"One . "
A,Task,"One . "
A,Task,"And features included also one . "
A,Minor,"And One . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . "
A,Task,"Uh we still think so . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Device fancy feeling . "
C,Task,"And I think fancy-feeling too comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm cool man . "
C,Task,"because of the titanium back . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"Are there enough technology ? "
A,Task,"Yeah well also we have two . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's great . "
A,Elicit,"Is the device easy to use ? "
B,Minor,"The "
A,Task,"Yes "
A,Task,"we have not many buttons . "
C,Task,"So well maybe two "
D,Minor,"Well comm with the uh "
C,Task,"because of the voice recorder . "
B,Task,"Two two . "
A,Task,"Two comm three . "
D,Task,"Three . "
B,Minor,"T "
A,Task,"Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? "
C,Minor,"F "
A,Task,"Well in our covers comm in our fronts . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So yes comm one . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"One or two . Yeah . "
B,Task,"One or two comm "
B,Task,"another two . "
D,Task,"Nah "
D,Task,"f four I think . "
C,Other,"Four ? "
D,Task,"If you look at this "
C,Task,"Well comm it doesn't really resemble any fruit comm uh that's true . "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course . "
A,Task,"Oh okay . Okay . "
B,Task,"Well three . "
D,Task,"Three comm alright . "
C,Task,"And you can also have front with uh with fruit on it . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
A,Elicit,"Is the material attractive ? "
D,Minor,"But "
B,Minor,"Mm . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well the titanium is strong comm "
A,Task,"and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . "
A,Task,"So I would say at least two . "
D,Task,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Well Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"This is the last meeting ? "
A,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Task,"but we we have to design much more comm "
D,Task,"The average will uh come later . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . "
C,Task,"I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Task,"There had to be some kind of trouble along the way . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yes . Well comm "
A,Task,"look at the costs at this point . "
C,Task,"My god . "
A,Task,"I had to fit it in . "
D,Elicit,"It has to go to twelve comm right ? "
A,Task,"I twelve and a half . "
D,Other,"Twelve and a half . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"Well what costs a lot ? "
A,Task,"The sample spea costs four . "
C,Other,"The what ? "
C,Minor,"The "
A,Task,"The sample speaker comm "
D,Task,"Out . "
A,Task,"the s sensor . "
D,Task,"That's easy . "
D,Task,"Kick it out . "
A,Task,"Kick it out . "
B,Other,"The what ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We have to go to twelve and a half . "
D,Task,"The speaker . "
A,Task,"The speaker costs far comm by far the most . "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option . "
D,Task,"That's some wrong info comm man . "
A,Task,"It it isn't worth it . "
C,Task,"No . No comm d th No . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"We could make two different versions comm one with and one without . "
D,Minor,"It's uh "
A,Task,"But for this "
D,Task,"It's just extra . "
D,Task,"Kick it out . "
A,Task,"So comm zero . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Then we go to fourteen point six . "
D,Elicit,"What more ? "
A,Task,"Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually . "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"Batteries are uh quite "
A,Minor,"L_C_ three ? "
A,Task,"Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on comm "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Uh no comm no no no . "
A,Task,"w a remote control has a battery . "
C,Minor,"N "
C,Task,"Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think . "
C,Minor,"Because uh "
B,Elicit,"Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ? "
A,Task,"Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said . "
C,Task,"the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah ? "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Can't we do that with a regular chip ? "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Elicit,"Why not ? "
C,Minor,"Because uh that uh y "
A,Elicit,"Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ? "
C,Task,"because my information says it . "
C,Other,"Huh ? "
A,Elicit,"What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . Regular is normal . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And simple ? "
C,Task,"Uh well yeah I I read something about it comm but "
B,Other,"Simple . "
A,Task,"Nothing . "
B,Other,"Elementary . "
A,Elicit,"Well ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I I read something about it comm "
A,Task,"Your part . "
C,Task,"but it wasn't very clear . "
C,Task,"I d I didn't in include it in my report . "
A,Task,"What happens if we do "
C,Other,"Single "
C,Task,"Well you have to use a chip . So "
C,Task,"Well you have to use the advanced chip comm if you have the L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Elicit,"How much do we win ? "
B,Minor,"We we we "
A,Task,"One . "
B,Elicit,"Why ? "
B,Task,"We have very little options furthermore comm "
B,Minor,"for the "
C,Task,"But if you have a regular chip comm you can't have the L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh well we have to put that in . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Task,"That that's a fact . Uh "
A,Task,"Well comm we could say comm well this special colour comm that isn't that that isn't there comm "
D,Minor,"No "
A,Task,"because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but it's only one half . "
B,Minor,"Nah . "
D,Task,"No comm that's n It's not relevant . "
C,Minor,"Uh it d it doesn't "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you must change the chip uh back . "
A,Task,"then you s then you only have one half left . "
B,Task,"You must change the chip back comm Nils . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh yeah . "
C,Task,"But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"Then the whole concept is uh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I know "
C,Task,"but that's what my information says . "
C,Task,"I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . No we oh "
D,Minor,"You "
D,Task,"You can make you can make it cheaper . "
C,Task,"You have to use it . "
D,Task,"But if you don't sell "
B,Task,"You you we have an advanced chip-on-print comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and we have an L_C_ display . "
B,Task,"I think that's a bit double . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"Y we don't need both . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display . "
C,Task,"For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Says . "
A,Task,"Says comm his Uh that was in the second meeting comm I think . "
C,Elicit,"Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? "
C,Task,"Because we you have uncurved "
A,Task,"Well I I did single curve to "
A,Task,"Well you said s double curved comm "
B,Task,"I ? "
B,Task,"? "
A,Task,"uh he comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already . "
A,Task,"We can also make it flat . "
D,Minor,"No "
C,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"no no no . "
C,Minor,"But what what did what do n "
A,Minor,"But "
C,Other,"Sorry comm "
C,Elicit,"but What do they mean with the curves ? "
C,Elicit,"Is th Is this a curve ? "
A,Other,"Curved ? "
A,Task,"Yes comm that's curved . "
C,Elicit,"One curve ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm this is actually two curves comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"It's how you It's how you look at it . "
A,Task,"No comm it's one curve . "
B,Task,"One curve . "
A,Task,"One curve comm simple . "
C,Task,"Well then we have a huge problem I think . "
C,Task,"W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half . "
A,Task,"We have a big financial problem . "
B,Task,"Well we make it more expensive to buy . "
A,Task,"Well comm then we have two dollars less profit . "
A,Task,"Come on comm "
A,Task,"if we if we if we make this fifty million comm they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us comm so uh "
D,Task,"If if you make people brand-aware comm they are willing to pay more . "
D,Task,"But Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy . "
C,Minor,"But uh I "
B,Minor,"Yeah or we could replace it "
D,Minor,"If you if you make it cool to have "
A,Task,"By the way comm we also have this one . "
D,Task,"Oh comm that's just great . "
A,Task,"Oh comm costs nothing . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm alright . "
A,Task,"That's nice . "
A,Minor,"Plastic is "
C,Task,"Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen comm it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . "
A,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Task,"but I just got it . "
C,Minor,"Well that's pretty uh l "
B,Task,"Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium comm "
D,Task,"That is pretty stupid . "
C,Task,"N not very practical . Well "
B,Task,"uh titanium-coloured plastic ? "
A,Other,"Who ? "
A,Elicit,"You want to dump the titanium ? "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"well if we uh we we have to get cheaper . "
A,Task,"And make all plastic comm then we ha then we're there . "
C,Task,"But I'm n I don't agree . "
B,Task,"But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . "
C,Minor,"I think "
A,Task,"Th then you have a ugly comm stupid comm l ugly looking comm dumb remote that that no-one would buy . "
B,Task,"Ah no no . "
B,Task,"It's not ugly looking . "
B,Task,"The looks remain the same . "
A,Task,"No comm I don't think so . "
D,Minor,"Y "
B,Task,"Well comm I do think so . "
C,Task,"I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"And the feel comm "
B,Minor,"feel . "
A,Task,"and th that it is strong comm and "
C,Task,"And also the the older people will like it because of that . "
C,Minor,"And because i "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
C,Task,"Alright it's not our target audience comm "
C,Task,"but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people . "
A,Minor,"We still "
A,Task,"we had to focus to get more people from the younger group comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but not lose the one "
C,Task,"I think the titanium is very important . "
B,Other,"Yeah alright "
B,Task,"but then we we won't get there . "
C,Task,"Yeah we have a problem comm yeah . "
C,Task,"W But you can better comm yeah comm dump the L_C_D_ screen then . "
B,Task,"We can dump the special colour . "
B,Task,"We l we use plastic . "
B,Task,"And plastic is already in colour I think . "
D,Task,"I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Elicit,"Well what else ? "
C,Minor,"W I mean uh "
B,Task,"No comm nothing . "
D,Minor,"Or you shou It's "
B,Minor,"Amen . "
D,Task,"Or change the titanium "
D,Task,"or dump the L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Task,"But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Because you have lots of functions in it too . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm well yeah . Alright . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Why can't I "
C,Task,"I agree with that . "
B,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"So we u we use uh Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic . "
A,Other,"I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
C,Task,"So titanium-coloured plastic for the back . "
A,Other,"I I'll talk to the managers . "
B,Task,"No no no no . "
B,Task,"W Titanium stays there . "
A,Task,"Titanium comm I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But "
C,Task,"Yeah this is good comm "
D,Minor,"Osl "
C,Task,"but it it's not good enough . "
C,Task,"So we have to use the ditch the titanium comm I'm afraid . "
A,Other,"Ah those those account managers comm what do th d what do they know ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Other,"Come on . Riot . "
C,Task,"What do we Well what do we know ? "
C,Task,"All we want is a is a fancy design "
C,Task,"but we don't really consider the costs . So "
A,Minor,"Yes comm yes . "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"because we did not know anything about it . "
D,Task,"If you don't have the money comm you can't make it . "
C,Task,"Yeah al alright comm yeah . "
A,Task,"One and a half Euros . Hmm ? "
C,Task,"But we have to deal with it now . So "
D,Minor,"So s "
D,Task,"If you don't have the money comm you can't make it . "
D,Task,"So this is too expensive . "
A,Task,"So ? "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"So we have to make it cheaper . "
C,Task,"Titanium gone "
C,Task,"and add plastic . "
D,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but then we've got money left . "
C,Task,"And on plastic times two "
C,Task,"and then we uh are there ? "
A,Task,"Well comm no it's just uh all plastic . "
C,Minor,"No "
A,Task,"Well alright . Huh . "
C,Minor,"No yeah well "
C,Task,"Oh six . "
C,Task,"A lot of plastic comm yeah . "
D,Task,"It's just free comm man . "
A,Other,"Four . So "
C,Task,"No two for the to make it clear . "
A,Task,"But then we can add the special colour ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"As we have money over uh left . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . W "
A,Task,"And we still have money left . "
A,Elicit,"What do we want comm guys ? "
C,Task,"I want gold plating . "
C,Minor,"No no um "
D,Task,"Yeah right . "
D,Task,"I want chrome . "
B,Task,"Well I think uh the case is double curved then . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Because you y have that curve "
C,Minor,"We have we have to uh fill "
B,Task,"and you have that curve . "
A,Other,"Y Oh no . "
C,Minor,"W we ha "
B,Minor,"Yeah well uh "
D,Task,"Well comm th that that is the problem . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"No no no comm "
C,Minor,"but th that's not f um "
A,Minor,"Safe . "
B,Task,"Well y we have curves in all directions . "
C,Task,"Well you can you can double curve comm if you don't have titanium . "
C,Task,"And that we dropped comm "
C,Task,"so it it can be done . "
A,Minor,"So alright . "
C,Task,"But it's pretty funny . "
C,Task,"We we do want to reach twelve point five . "
C,Task,"But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven . "
A,Other,"Finance ? "
B,Task,"I mean comm this this ain't titanium comm "
B,Task,"but it looks like it . "
C,Task,"We get more salary comm if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half . "
A,Other,"Well comm guys ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Guys ? "
A,Task,"We have to dump our titanium comm "
D,Task,"Shoot . "
A,Task,"and we'll hate the managers for that comm "
A,Task,"but now we're going to evaluate our project comm of uh project comm "
C,Other,"Objection . "
B,Other,"Pro project . "
A,Other,"project . "
A,Task,"Well comm satisfaction on for example comm "
A,Elicit,"are we satisfactory about our creativity ? "
C,Other,"Well I can't get no satisfaction comm but uh "
C,Minor,"I think it's uh "
C,Task,"Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm me too . "
A,Task,"That's really bad . "
C,Task,"Its it's uh ridiculous actually comm but "
A,Task,"But that that that's that comm yeah that's a reason comm "
B,Task,"And uh unrealistic . "
A,Task,"but also for our creativity . "
A,Task,"We had um nice design comm "
A,Task,"and then you get the cost comm "
A,Task,"and you had to dump all your creativity . "
B,Task,"Well we we we used our creativity comm "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"but we just had to adapt it to the costs . "
C,Task,"Which isn't very practical comm "
C,Task,"but that's the way . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Nei . Uh no . "
A,Minor,"Well comm alright . "
C,Other,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"Uh leadership "
A,Task,"next . "
B,Task,"Terrible . "
A,Task,"Uh teamwork ? "
D,Task,"Leadership . "
B,Minor,"Leadership ? Well "
D,Task,"Well it's It was very democratic . "
A,Task,"Uh yeah well I think so also . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time comm so "
D,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"Well the managers were terrible . So comm with their all their useless requirements . "
A,Elicit,"But o alright comm the teamwork ? "
C,Task,"Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements . "
C,Task,"It's the requirements of the user comm uh I guess . "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"they said comm oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext comm uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"but they base that on on the user specifications . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm "
A,Elicit,"teamwork ? "
D,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"Well great I think . "
B,Task,"Right yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm think so too . "
A,Elicit,"Uh well what do you comm what did you think about the SMARTboard ? "
C,Task,"It was a complete disaster . "
C,Minor,"No Uh it it it uh it is uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I don't like it . Yeah ? "
A,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"that's a SMARTboard comm "
B,Task,"and that's a digital pen . "
A,Task,"It's also a It's both the SMARTboards . "
B,Elicit,"Or not ? "
C,Task,"No it's other way around . "
C,Task,"That's the SMARTboard . "
C,Task,"That's the digital panel . "
A,Task,"I liked this SMARTboard comm "
D,Task,"This this this isn't a SMARTboard comm right ? "
A,Task,"but I hated that one . "
A,Task,"Well it's both a SMARTboard . "
C,Task,"That's that's the smart "
D,Minor,"Yeah right . "
D,Minor,"B but you "
D,Task,"This is just a large t large television . "
B,Other,"Oh they're both SMARTboards . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Minor,"You u you use the "
C,Task,"A televi Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's both a SMARTboard comm "
A,Task,"but this one is used for a desktop comm "
A,Task,"and that one is used to to draw . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm but you ca "
D,Task,"This is just a beamer function . "
D,Task,"And here comm on this one comm you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But "
A,Elicit,"Well comm wi w which one did you like ? "
C,Elicit,"Yeah . Left or right ? "
D,Task,"That one . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"That one . "
D,Task,"That one isn't accurate . "
D,Task,"It just doesn't work . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"You can "
B,Task,"But I I think this is meant by the digital pen . "
A,Task,"Yes . Th that is so . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but I think there's a big distinction between the these th "
C,Task,"Well I didn't use uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We're now talking about the SMARTboards . "
D,Task,"I don't need a SMARTboard . "
C,Minor,"Nei It it's much m "
B,Task,"Well we we used that one comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"and we needed it . I think . "
D,Task,"but give me a beamer . "
D,Task,"That's uh that's much uh much cheaper . "
B,Task,"Yeah alright comm but "
A,Task,"Or install a laptop to a beamer comm "
A,Task,"or have this one standing here in an "
A,Task,"I I like it . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Yeah I like that one comm "
A,Minor,"Okay comm alright . "
B,Task,"but that one is terrible . "
C,Minor,"But uh you can uh "
C,Task,"I I sent it about three times now . "
C,Task,"Uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm it is . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"The simple uh sch school board . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"I agree . "
A,Elicit,"And uh the digi the digital pen ? "
A,Elicit,"Did uh did you like that one ? "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"I I didn't use it . "
C,Task,"I wrote things down "
C,Task,"but I didn't import it into my laptop . "
A,Task,"I used it uh just to check it out comm but uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You you can't send that to anyone comm "
C,Minor,"That's the "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself comm "
D,Task,"It isn't practical . Right . "
A,Task,"and then you're going to send it comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Well comm no . "
C,Task,"W But also y you write things down . "
C,Task,"And i you can also bring your your your note block . "
D,Task,"Your notepad . Yeah . "
C,Task,"So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into "
A,Task,"It's comm no comm it it's useless . "
B,Task,"Well I I drew this . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"And I made a mistake . "
B,Task,"But it it would have been uh useful comm if I I could show this on the screen . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah alright . For drawings comm "
A,Task,"For drawings comm yes . "
C,Task,"but not for personal notes . "
B,Task,"Yeah for drawings . "
C,Minor,"I think that's not very "
B,Minor,"N notes mm . "
C,Task,"Uh I mean you can bring your paperwork along "
C,Task,"and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper "
A,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that . "
C,Minor,"If you've If you've "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"But for notes comm it i you you have to put that in a strict "
A,Task,"Uh you have to put a name comm standard date comm and all those things . "
A,Task,"And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . "
A,Task,"So if you uh were to write them down for yourself comm and then put that in your computer comm you still have to type it over to Word . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm right . "
A,Minor,"So it doesn't d doesn't have any "
D,Minor,"That Stefan use . "
C,Task,"Yeah I understand . "
C,Task,"But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . "
C,Minor,"You can't "
C,Minor,"It's not very uh ni "
D,Task,"No comm I don't think so . "
C,Minor,"Yeah well a lot of documents are Yeah . "
D,Task,"It's it's only useful if you have to draw something . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But then uh it's really useful comm I think . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yep . Alright . "
C,Other,"Mu Yeah right . "
A,Elicit,"Um etcetera ? Well uh the laptops ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm great . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Of course great . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Hmm . "
C,Elicit,"Can we keep them ? Uh . "
A,Task,"Yeah . You can . "
A,Minor,"B by my "
D,Other,"Wireless uh wireless things . "
B,Other,"Thanks Project Manager . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Other uh things we used here ? "
A,Task,"I hated the cameras comm "
A,Task,"I hated the microphones . "
D,Task,"Well these chairs comm man . Really great . "
A,Minor,"But No "
C,Elicit,"Well did you really uh Did you really take uh take those in account ? "
C,Task,"I half of time I didn't notice they were there . So "
A,Task,"No . No . "
A,Task,"I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera . "
A,Task,"I don't care about it . "
B,Task,"Well I did . "
C,Task,"But we shouldn't talk about that . "
C,Task,"Because this is a realistic environment . "
A,Task,"Well w why not ? "
A,Minor,"Uh etcetera We "
C,Task,"Right . Okay . "
A,Elicit,"N new ideas found ? "
A,Elicit,"What kind of ideas for n a future schedule What ? For future um meetings you have got ? "
B,Task,"Well I missed uh the option to uh to email comm "
D,Task,"Communicate in between . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Email or chat or something . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm right . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Chatting and emailing . "
C,Task,"But yeah . W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with . So "
B,Task,"Yeah alright comm "
B,Task,"but that's one n new idea . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
A,Elicit,"Well comm new ideas found by this . "
A,Task,"Not . "
A,Task,"Nothing . "
D,Task,"Well comm more more information in the beginning . "
A,Task,"We don't want this . "
A,Task,"We hate this . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"That's "
A,Task,"Digital pen is useless . So "
B,Task,"No it isn't . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm for drawings . "
C,Task,"Well comm for drawing for drawings . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So it isn't useless . "
A,Minor,"But uh two t "
A,Task,"But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings comm "
A,Task,"because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things comm I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive comm I'm not going to uh "
C,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"For people who uh sketch th the whole day comm I can imagine that it's useful . "
C,Minor,"No "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop . "
C,Task,"But it's still an expensive uh expensive "
A,Task,"Because this is huge "
D,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"uh this v very very uh expensive paper . "
B,Task,"Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
B,Minor,"With the mouse it is No . "
C,Minor,"But if w Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well and if "
D,Task,"Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching . "
B,Task,"Uh indeed . "
C,Task,"And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . "
C,Task,"But suppose it was working correctly comm "
C,Elicit,"what uh would it be useful then comm if it wasn't off all the time ? A "
A,Task,"Well no . "
A,Task,"I hated to draw like that . "
A,Task,"You you can't draw anything uh neat . "
C,Task,"Really ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but he's saying if it is correct comm and you can draw very comm yeah comm very precise "
C,Task,"Anything you want . "
C,Minor,"Any b b Yeah . L li li "
A,Task,"I if it if it would be perfect following . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green uh school board . "
C,Task,"Well it isn't comm "
C,Minor,"but maybe that thing is uh is "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm mu "
C,Task,"Yeah comm board comm a school board comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but but then you can uh save it in instantly comm "
B,Task,"and and and re-use it comm and uh "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"I it has It is useful . Yeah . "
D,Task,"It saves time . "
A,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"This uh if it works correct comm "
C,Task,"maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning . "
C,Task,"So uh if we get in uh if we get another one "
C,Task,"and you make sure it does work comm "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"I think then it's pretty useful . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room . "
C,Task,"And then you can save it immediately . "
A,Task,"Well comm they are now . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Celebration . "
A,Task,"It is . "
A,Other,"So comm congratulations crew . "
C,Elicit,"Did you type that ? "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Other,"Celebration . "
A,Minor,"Se "
