A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Oh comm that's not gonna work . "
A,Other,"Oh comm alright . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um alright . "
D,Other,"Uh comm uh comm um . "
A,Other,"I'll just put that there . "
A,Task,"Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . "
A,Task,"Uh I'm Nick Debusk comm "
A,Task,"I'm the Project Manager . "
A,Task,"Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing comm what your what your role is um . "
A,Task,"Go ahead . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I am Corinne Whiting "
D,Task,"and I will be the Marketing Expert "
D,Task,"and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . "
D,Task,"In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification comm "
D,Task,"and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled comm "
D,Task,"and I'll be doing research to figure this out . "
D,Task,"In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching "
D,Task,"and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . "
D,Task,"And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation "
D,Task,"and so I will be collecting the requirements "
D,Task,"and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
C,Other,"Hiya "
C,Task,"comm I'm Ryan . "
C,Task,"Um I'm the User Interface Designer . "
C,Task,"Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . "
C,Task,"Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . "
C,Task,"Um in the concept design comm the user interface comm "
C,Task,"how the user reacts with the the product . "
C,Task,"And the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design comm "
C,Task,"what they might be looking for comm uh things like fashions comm "
C,Minor,"what makes wha "
C,Task,"how we're gonna make it special . "
C,Task,"That's about it . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"I'm Manuel "
B,Task,"and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . "
B,Task,"In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements comm "
B,Task,"um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . "
B,Task,"Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . "
B,Task,"Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And uh the detailed design in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself comm "
B,Task,"um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Task,"we've got our opening comm "
A,Task,"our our agenda is the opening comm uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training comm project plan discussion and then closing . "
A,Task,"Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Task,"we are putting together a new remote control . "
A,Task,"Um we want it to be something original . "
A,Task,"Um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a "
A,Task,"fashion um conscious electronics company comm "
A,Task,"so we want it to be trendy um "
A,Task,"and we want it to be easy to use . "
A,Task,"Um we've got the functional design comm conceptual design and detailed design "
A,Task,"um which basically is is the three of you um . "
A,Minor,"And w uh well um "
A,Minor,"functional design um . "
A,Minor,"Um do we have um any ideas of of maybe d "
A,Task,"let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have comm "
A,Task,"and then we can go into how we're gonna design it "
A,Task,"and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Well uh "
C,Minor,"s "
C,Minor,"function of remote control is just just "
C,Minor,"you know comm "
C,Task,"change channels is its main function . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or "
A,Elicit,"I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? "
C,Other,"Oh right . "
C,Task,"I suppose you c try make it a universal remote "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Minor,"for "
C,Task,"could work on all sort of electrical "
C,Task,"products in in one person's house . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"But comm you know comm they all sorta have the same role changing channels comm volumes and then programming . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . 'Kay . "
C,Task,"I think they all work on the same prin principle as well "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"sorta like "
C,Task,"I don't actually know . "
C,Elicit,"But is it just infra-red ? "
C,Elicit,"Is that standard ? "
A,Task,"I I think yeah comm yeah comm r universal remote . "
C,Minor,"Ye yeah . "
A,Task,"Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control comm "
D,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"Ours too . "
A,Other,"I think we're all in the same boat here . "
A,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily comm I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . "
D,Minor,"Ch "
A,Task,"So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh "
D,Task,"Like a tracking device ? "
A,Task,"like a tracking device "
C,Task,"Oh you can get those key "
A,Minor,"or or like a a "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"you could whistle "
C,Task,"or make a noise "
A,Task,"It makes a noise comm "
C,Task,"and it'd beep . "
A,Task,"there's a button on the T_V_ that you press "
B,Minor,"Mm comm mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"and "
B,Other,"Right . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"Be good . "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Generally comm all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Just long . "
A,Minor,"Do we want "
A,Task,"so they're kinda like long and rectangular . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Do we want something crazy ? "
C,Task,"Black usually . "
A,Minor,"You know comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"we want something new that's gonna stand out . "
D,Task,"Lot more modern . "
C,Task,"I think so . "
A,Minor,"A m a modern so our remote should be "
C,Task,"Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball . "
D,Task,"Maybe like user-friendly comm "
D,Minor,"like a little "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Task,"where you can use both hands comm like a little keyboard type thing . "
C,Minor,"People "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I thought maybe comm because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another "
C,Task,"if it was in a ball comm "
C,Task,"and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . "
A,Other,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"there are of course certain restrictions comm "
B,Task,"you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so there are always the some restrictions "
B,Task,"we have to apply here . "
B,Elicit,"Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be comm "
B,Task,"that refers to the material comm pretty much um . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"What are we gonna build that thing out of ? "
B,Elicit,"How sturdy is it gonna be ? "
B,Elicit,"Do we want it to last longer "
B,Elicit,"or rather have people "
B,Elicit,"whatever comm have to buy one every half a year ? "
A,Minor,"Okay so yeah comm "
A,Task,"so we want it to be sturdy comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"we want it to to hold up to somebody's child comm you know comm throwing it across the room "
A,Task,"or comm as you said comm "
A,Task,"people kinda throw it comm "
A,Task,"so ball-shaped comm uh you know comm if it were ball-shaped maybe comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It could be cased on the outside "
A,Minor,"then it "
C,Task,"and t everything could be inside . "
A,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Task,"we want it to be modern comm fun comm sturdy comm "
A,Minor,"um "
A,Task,"So our form and our function . "
A,Task,"Um we want it to be um easy to find . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"What else it what else do we want it to to do ? "
A,Task,"So we want it to be universal . "
A,Task,"It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros "
A,Minor,"um and you know comm "
A,Task,"goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros comm what they wanna make on it comm so . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association comm "
D,Task,"maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"That's more on the research end comm but the marketing . "
A,Minor,"So marketing comm "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Minor,"how maybe uh "
A,Task,"marketing comm you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And maybe as far as design goes comm maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences comm "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting . "
C,Minor,"Ye "
C,Other,"Small . "
B,Other,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? "
A,Task,"Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . "
A,Elicit,"Some ideas ? "
A,Task,"We want it to be a b a ball comm "
C,Minor,"I'd "
C,Other,"I could draw sorta the ball idea . "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Task,"we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball "
A,Task,"and maybe th um where the buttons are located . "
C,Task,"My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere comm "
C,Minor,"where maybe you "
C,Task,"this is where it's connected together comm "
C,Task,"and then when you open it out comm it could fol it could be maybe flip comm like a flip phone comm "
C,Minor,"and then when you fold it out the middle "
C,Task,"Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . "
C,Minor,"If that if we did use a hinge comm or if it was just two parts comm "
C,Task,"and then you'd have "
C,Task,"just sorta you you you know comm your buttons . "
C,Minor,"Thing is inside "
C,Task,"I think comm sometimes remotes have too many buttons comm "
C,Task,"so maybe as simple as possible comm "
C,Task,"um as few buttons inside as possible . "
C,Task,"Um comm I dunno comm what's the idea for . "
C,Minor,"Just something maybe if you ha "
C,Task,"if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . "
C,Other,"It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though comm to be fair . "
C,Task,"But yeah . "
D,Task,"Futuristic . "
C,Task,"That was that was a sorta simple idea I had "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Minor,"and then you know you could about "
C,Minor,"Right comm "
C,Task,"it would almost be like a ball . "
C,Task,"So that was just just an idea I had . "
C,Elicit,"I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ? "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"One problem you'd get with this design is "
B,Task,"um the ball is a nice idea "
B,Task,"because of it's stability really comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but of course comm since it's a ball comm "
B,Task,"it'll roll comm "
B,Task,"so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least comm down here somewhere comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Maybe f yeah . "
B,Task,"take away that part . "
B,Task,"That's one of the big issues . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's g that's a good idea . "
B,Task,"Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"The idea "
C,Task,"it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge comm "
C,Task,"that was just one idea though . "
B,Task,"That's that's interesting of course comm "
B,Task,"but that's of course a weak point comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"How would we go about um making you know getting rid of our weak points ? "
A,Minor,"What "
A,Elicit,"I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? "
A,Other,"Not to put you on the spot comm "
B,Minor,"E "
B,Other,"No no comm "
A,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"uh uh . "
A,Elicit,"What did you say your title was again ? "
B,Minor,"N n "
B,Task,"Uh comm I'm your Industrial Designer comm "
A,Other,"You're the the Industrial Designer . "
B,Minor,"so i b well comm "
B,Minor,"the point is "
B,Minor,"that "
B,Minor,"well "
B,Task,"maybe I dunno . "
B,Task,"The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"As as stable as it is comm "
B,Task,"there must be a compromise between um stability and design here comm so . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I I suppose that things become design . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"But I mean i "
C,Task,"I was trying to think of like the design of others . "
C,Task,"I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote comm "
C,Task,"maybe small comm sort of fatter ones comm "
C,Task,"but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's not new comm "
A,Task,"it's not innovative comm "
A,Minor,"it's "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Task,"everybody does long remote "
A,Task,"because it's easy comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"it's it's stable um . "
D,Minor,"'Kay comm "
D,Other,"I'll draw something . "
A,Minor,"So if "
D,Elicit,"What ? "
A,Task,"no comm "
A,Task,"go ahead . "
D,Task,"My idea was just to have it be kind of like a "
D,Task,"keyboard type shape comm you know comm like video games "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"l so . "
D,Minor,"But maybe "
D,Task,"I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . "
D,Task,"We could also try to do the hinge thing comm "
D,Task,"so it could like flip out that way . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"That's my idea . "
C,Task,"I think definitely doing something different "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"is a good idea . "
B,Other,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"I mean maybe design something comm that's sort of like "
C,Task,"suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same comm "
C,Task,"but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . "
A,Task,"Something with a grip . "
D,Task,"Mm . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm with a grip . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Because even I suppose even with the ball "
C,Minor,"It still might be hard to "
A,Minor,"it's "
C,Task,"it still not the ho easiest thing to hold comm yeah . "
A,Task,"it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better . "
C,Minor,"Like "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Task,"But then again comm people like to use one hand to flip "
A,Task,"and one hand to hold their soda comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"so maybe maybe we "
D,Task,"True . "
C,Minor,"It's d "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Task,"I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here . "
A,Minor,"Uh um "
D,Other,"That's fine . "
D,Task,"You're the boss comm "
D,Other,"you're allowed to . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size "
B,Minor,"w "
B,Task,"'cause you know from cell phones comm they can be too small . "
B,Minor,"So if the remote is too small it "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"if it's small it probably looks better comm "
B,Task,"but "
B,Task,"may not be th as functional . "
B,Minor,"So for that there's "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . "
A,Task,"Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control "
A,Task,"and um we've got a couple ideas um . "
A,Other,"Let's see here . "
A,Minor,"What if we had what if we had not only um "
A,Task,"say we went with the ball the ball function "
A,Task,"um comm but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um "
A,Task,"to make it easier to hold on to . "
A,Minor,"So you know um s so "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"it's easier to hold onto that way . "
A,Task,"Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised comm "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"say the cover flips over "
A,Task,"and covers that part . "
A,Minor,"So the grip is "
A,Task,"No comm that wouldn't work either um . "
A,Task,"But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom comm then that eliminates our ball anyways . "
A,Task,"So if it were flat on the bottom "
A,Task,"and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess comm "
A,Minor,"um "
A,Minor,"and then flat uh "
A,Task,"And then we have the problem with the hinge . "
A,Task,"So if we're flat on the bottom comm it's not gonna roll away comm "
A,Task,"it'll stay where we want . "
B,Task,"The question is also comm I dunno comm d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? "
A,Task,"Mm comm that's true . "
B,Task,"It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway comm "
B,Task,"so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . "
B,Task,"From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is comm "
B,Task,"but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident comm uh the more we sell . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"it's "
B,Task,"don't make it too stable uh . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we don't have it flip open . "
A,Task,"We just have a ball "
C,Task,"But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . "
B,Task,"To the other design . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"so then we forget the ball . "
B,Task,"It looks cool . "
D,Task,"Looks cool though . "
A,Task,"It looks cool comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but it's really not it's not functional um . "
B,Task,"Uh functional . "
A,Task,"So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . "
A,Task,"What if we flipped it around here comm "
A,Minor,"so that it were um "
A,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Task,"that doesn't look anything like what you had there . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Task,"it's up and down comm "
A,Task,"you hold it this way . "
A,Task,"Course then it's it's like the rectangular again comm only with a couple of jutting out points . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Right . Right . "
A,Task,"But it's one-handed um . "
B,Elicit,"Question is what makes those game pads functional ? "
B,Minor,"W "
B,Task,"I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . "
B,Task,"So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy comm "
D,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"right comm "
B,Task,"makes it nice comm "
B,Task,"so that's the essential part . "
B,Task,"Except for that I think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"You know comm all "
B,Minor,"that dif batteries "
A,Task,"because it doesn't have a cord comm like joysticks do . "
B,Task,"right comm "
B,Task,"and Batteries go weak as well comm "
B,Minor,"so um "
B,Task,"after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it comm "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"So comm have to m show which is the front comm which is the back . "
A,Elicit,"Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? "
A,Task,"So that either way you're pointing it it would work . "
B,Task,"I suppose you could do that . "
B,Task,"O of course the more technology you stick in that comm the more it'll cost comm so . "
A,Other,"More expensive and yeah . "
B,Task,"Course you can do that . "
A,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or "
B,Task,"if you look at it comm it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it comm "
B,Task,"since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff comm "
A,Task,"True . "
B,Task,"but um it's rather about an instinctual thing comm "
C,Minor,"Put it "
B,Task,"like you just grab it comm "
B,Task,"you don't have to s look at it comm "
B,Minor,"you know comm "
B,Task,"which way around to point it . "
B,Task,"Otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work . "
C,Task,"Even if you designed it in some in a way that you know comm isn't a rectangle comm "
C,Task,"but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . "
C,Task,"So if that's your thing "
C,Task,"and you got something like that instead comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"and there's your s you kn "
C,Task,"you know which way you're gonna pointing it . "
A,Other,"'Kay . "
D,Other,"Sorry to interrupt comm "
C,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"but we have a warning to finish . "
A,Elicit,"Are we out of time ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well comm "
A,Task,"just to finish up comm "
A,Elicit,"should we s go with this plan comm "
A,Minor,"start making some "
A,Minor,"Are good ideas comm what are not . "
B,Task,"Let's . "
C,Minor,"Does it say what does it say for n "
B,Minor,"Obviously "
C,Task,"it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting comm I think . "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"Must finish now comm so . "
C,Minor,"T "
A,Task,"And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Alright . "
D,Other,"Great . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around comm "
A,Other,"be a little bit more prepared . "
A,Minor,"And uh alright comm "
A,Other,"good meeting . "
