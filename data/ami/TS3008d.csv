A,Task,"Okay comm welcome to the detailed design meeting . "
A,Other,"Again comm I'm gonna take minutes . "
A,Task,"Oh comm we're gonna have a prototype presentation first . "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm who's gonna give the prototype presentation ? "
A,Elicit,"You two guys ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Okay . Go ahead . "
D,Minor,". "
B,Minor,". "
B,Minor,"coffee . "
C,Task,"'Kay comm we've made a prototype . "
C,Minor,"Um comm "
C,Task,"we've got uh uh our aspects from the last meeting . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm "
C,Task,"especially we looked at the form comm material and the colour . "
C,Minor,"Um comm "
C,Task,"we've uh drawn here the p prototype . "
C,Task,"The logo is uh is uh is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control comm "
C,Task,"but "
C,Task,"it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher . "
C,Minor,"Um comm "
C,Task,"our interface elements comm there are shown in the in the drawing . "
C,Task,"Maybe you can uh point them uh The functions . "
B,Task,"Uh comm well the uh all the functions are discussed uh "
B,Task,"I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm it's a little bit . "
B,Task,"Uh comm power button . "
B,Task,"Uh then the the the nine uh channels . "
B,Task,"Uh the volume uh uh at the side comm and the other side is the programmes . "
B,Task,"And then we had uh just uh two buttons comm we place them in the middle comm uh the menu comm and for the teletext "
A,Task,"Oh no comm the the the mute button misses now . "
B,Minor,"I thought that was th "
D,Minor,"Alright comm I "
B,Task,"Oh comm the mute button . "
A,Minor,"Do y do you "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"did we want to have a m mute button ? "
C,Minor,"But uh that "
C,Task,"It's uh here then comm in the middle . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Alright comm and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Task,"Yes comm um "
C,Minor,"we've disc "
B,Minor,"Well comm yeah mo uh mo "
B,Task,"Yeah comm well most of them are right-handed . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but you you gotta make it clear on the on "
C,Task,"Most of the users "
C,Task,"Yes comm y there there will be a p a little a little P_ on that and a little uh yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah well comm I don't have time in uh anymore on the "
D,Task,"Yeah comm and a and a triangle on that . "
B,Task,"Oh yeah comm just progr programme above comm I think . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually . "
A,Other,"Wait comm there's was one thing I wanted to ask . "
A,Task,"Uh comm there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like "
A,Task,"uh d I call it teens and twenties . "
A,Task,"Uh comm y th th th the two numbers . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"All n no comm that's um kinda dependent on the television . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm true comm yeah . "
C,Task,"It's a television . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Uh "
A,Elicit,"but do we have do we need extra buttons comm "
A,Minor,"for example some uh some have to "
D,Minor,"I think "
B,Task,"Uh I think so . "
C,Task,"Yes comm yes comm you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it comm "
C,Task,"uh th with the one and a double uh uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I think you should add "
B,Task,"Zero ? "
D,Task,"A cross comm or whatever . Yeah comm line . "
B,Task,"May maybe here ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but you don't you don't actually need them comm "
C,Task,"yes . "
A,Task,"becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first comm then you have a couple of seconds "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And then a second . "
D,Task,"No comm that's dependent on the television . "
A,Task,"No comm I don't think so . "
C,Task,"Yes comm you have televisions comm then you have to comm you know comm you have to uh press "
D,Task,"I do know so . "
B,Elicit,"Is it depending on television ? "
A,Task,"Nah comm I don't think so really comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"because you have a "
A,Task,"I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons comm but you still can comm know comm obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . "
C,Minor,"Yes comm but but a lot uh "
D,Task,"Yes comm but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television . "
D,Task,"Or actually comm the other way around . "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"No comm I think uh I really think it's n "
A,Minor,"because you can "
A,Task,"when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash comm it's the same thing as when you just push the one comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply . "
C,Minor,"Yes comm but "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm well but su If "
C,Task,"some televisions don't accept uh that that "
A,Task,"Yeah comm because that's i it's for television . It's exact the same thing . "
C,Task,"No comm no comm "
C,Minor,"but s "
D,Task,"No no no . So some television respond differently . "
D,Minor,"Look comm if uh i i "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Other,"listen listen . "
A,Task,"When you push the button comm the remote control gives a signal . "
A,Task,"I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yes comm that's true . "
A,Task,"The one with dash comm "
A,Minor,"that signal gi "
A,Task,"and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds comm then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"True . "
D,Task,"No "
A,Task,"I think it works that way comm really . "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it comm uh if you push a one comm then on your television there will appear a one and a a line comm which is an empty space . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button . "
C,Task,"Yes comm but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button comm uh then you go to a a next level comm you can push two buttons . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point . "
D,Task,"Yep . True . "
A,Task,"I think it's exact the same thing when y "
C,Minor,"You want "
C,Task,"Yes comm but some television don't support it . "
A,Task,"No comm but then they would a would also support that button comm because it's the same thing . "
B,Minor,"But the ex "
A,Other,"Listen comm "
A,Minor,"with that that's "
A,Task,"that special but button you're talking about comm eh ? "
A,Task,"That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash comm which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . "
A,Task,"When you don't have that separate button comm and you push y one comm it's exactly the same thing . "
A,Minor,"Do y you "
A,Task,"the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had "
D,Task,"No comm s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"a remote can "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Minor,"so they need no comm they need "
A,Task,"But you give the input . "
A,Task,"You push the one . "
A,Task,"That's the same thing as the button with the one and it "
D,Task,"No comm that's not true . "
D,Task,"It's simply not true . It's simply not true . "
A,Task,"yes it it is . "
A,Other,"Think about it . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"but uh "
B,Task,"You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash comm and then wait uh two uh seconds or something "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"And it's the same thing what happens "
A,Task,"and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . "
D,Task,"No comm remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds . "
D,Task,"Remote control is a stupid thing . "
D,Task,"If you push a button comm it sends it immediately to to the television . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but I m uh but it's "
A,Task,"I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied comm only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash comm but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons comm it still works . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm it "
A,Minor,"But okay comm we we'll impl "
D,Task,"No comm definitely not . Definitely not . "
B,Task,"We'll discuss them in the usability lab . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"we'll apply them then for now . "
B,Minor,"Uh eva evaluation . "
B,Task,"I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm app just apply them next to the zero comm the one and the two . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm for now comm if we don't know for sure whether "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"And the button for the SCART uh audio video uh external input . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Other,"Ach . "
A,Minor,"Yeah but "
D,Task,"Uh comm you can access that uh via zero comm and then minus comm I guess . "
A,Minor,"okay . "
A,Task,"What I said about uh the remote control sending another signal comm that that might not be true comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but I still think i it it all T_V_s in some ways support it comm "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
C,Task,"No comm no . "
A,Task,"I think it's more c is m maybe we don't uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works comm "
A,Task,"but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said . "
C,Task,"Uh comm remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . "
A,Task,"I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M "
C,Minor,"Uh comm some "
C,Task,"N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten "
A,Elicit,"Th won't work wi with uh "
C,Task,"No comm you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . "
A,Task,"to have that special button . "
C,Task,"When you uh press one button comm you give one signal . "
C,Task,"And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . "
C,Minor,"But "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Okay comm well we'll see . "
C,Task,"When you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals comm it could work comm but "
C,Task,"Just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I kinda miss the docking station . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"It's here on the "
B,Minor,"Well it "
B,Minor,"yeah comm uh there's nothing "
C,Minor,"We came uh "
B,Task,"I think it's pretty basic comm "
B,Minor,"the the there's no fu "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"there's one there's one button comm "
D,Task,"No nothing really trendy about it . "
B,Minor,"that's wha there's there's "
B,Task,"there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it . "
C,Task,"But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell comm "
D,Minor,"The button . "
C,Task,"because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"So maybe we can uh use the docking station comm for example comm uh M_P_ three players or or uh "
C,Task,"uh hearing devices . "
D,Task,"I think that's very difficult comm because of different shapes of uh uh devices . "
C,Task,"Yes comm but when you put that same volt voltages on it comm you can put uh "
C,Task,"when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it comm when it's o the same as the other products comm you can put it all on the same uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape comm of course . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Minor,"but we can make "
D,Task,"The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true . "
D,Task,"But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this comm then they all fit . "
C,Task,"No comm we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's true comm "
D,Minor,"but uh "
C,Task,"When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out comm we can place all on top of it . "
D,Task,"Yes comm "
D,Minor,"but uh I I g "
C,Task,"Just have to be big enough for the biggest "
D,Elicit,"Shouldn't it fall then ? It isn't going to fall down ? "
D,Minor,"That's a bit uh "
D,Task,"yeah comm I think "
C,Task,"No comm when you make it large enough no it it will not . "
C,Minor,"But then it's a little bit "
D,Minor,"No comm but if if "
D,Other,"like this comm I'll I'll point it out comm "
D,Task,"if you got uh a a a base a base like this comm "
C,Task,"But it's just an idea . "
D,Other,"I won't draw it really . "
D,Task,"If you got a base which is uh as big as this "
C,Task,"But it's flat it's flat as as this comm "
C,Task,"so we can p make all the products as flat as this . "
B,Minor,"You can . "
D,Task,"Yeah sure comm "
B,Task,"But i i i it's backwards . "
D,Task,"but if you got if you got a tiny player comm it can "
C,Minor,"Yes comm but when you make uh uh a bit of big "
B,Task,"But it's it's backwards . "
B,Task,"It's leaning . It's leaning backwards comm I think comm in the in the docking station . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh comm wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom "
D,Other,"oh comm right comm help . "
B,Task,"That's text . "
A,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"Uh comm you could make like a hole in it comm you know comm of uh in in the "
C,Task,"Yes comm little holer littler Uh comm little products go deeper in it . "
D,Task,"Yeah . That i that is possible comm yep . "
A,Task,"Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later comm "
A,Task,"because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway comm because we have some uh cost issues still to come . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm sure comm you're right . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"And uh uh "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"But we have to look n I don't know . "
C,Task,"the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control comm "
D,Task,"I don't like the colours . "
C,Task,"because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button comm "
C,Task,"which is the most common used uh function comm "
C,Task,"and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb . "
C,Task,"So it's it's it's really good design . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Alright . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"That's it ? "
C,Task,"Yes comm uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber comm "
C,Task,"and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material comm a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . "
D,Minor,"The light . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"And other lights ? "
A,Task,"I think added lights are gonna be a problem too . "
C,Task,"Yes comm we can make also n neon lights on it comm or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . "
D,Task,"No comm o on the on the front . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"Maybe the uh the logo . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"lights ? "
C,Task,"But comm it will also uh uh use batteries comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm why not ? "
C,Elicit,"and do we want to "
D,Task,"Of course . "
A,Task,"Okay . For now comm uh this is uh is good enough . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah comm what was uh on the "
C,Task,"The all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"but in the "
A,Task,"oh yeah comm the colour comm "
A,Task,"because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber comm "
A,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons . "
A,Task,"And they're be a they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh comm in the same colour as the side . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think I think that'll be good . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And I think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic comm "
A,Task,"and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff "
C,Task,"Yes comm maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights comm "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"so it will uh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we'll talk about the lights later . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"'Cause I also don yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"it's depends on the costs and such . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But uh comm and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours comm "
A,Task,"but may I dunno if that's important comm "
A,Task,"but we'll talk about that later . "
A,Task,"Okay comm for now this is this is okay . "
D,Minor,"We will . "
A,Minor,"Um comm the next p y "
A,Elicit,"you gonna give a presentation too ? "
A,Other,"Uh comm I have to see the agenda . "
D,Other,"Well comm uh yeah comm I I'm gonna do something right there comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"No . "
A,Other,"Detail design . "
D,Task,"We gotta do that on the right the most right-most screen comm "
D,Minor,"because the leftmost "
A,Task,"Evaluation criteria . "
D,Task,"Yep comm that's me . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Task,"I will be needing that image comm "
D,Task,"so leave it please . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Other,"Go away . "
D,Task,"Right comm we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points . "
D,Task,"Um comm we g the four of us are going to do that um together . "
D,Other,"I wanna have a colour over here comm come on . "
D,Task,"Right comm the remote is not ugly comm "
D,Task,"a bit weird sentence comm "
D,Task,"but "
D,Task,"the positive things has to be on the left comm so I said not ugly instead of ugly . "
D,Elicit,"Uh comm what would you say comm "
D,Task,"we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design comm "
D,Other,"and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think four maybe would be appropriate comm "
A,Minor,"because it's "
A,Task,"Yeah comm maybe it really depends on taste . "
A,Task,"Uh comm I mean it's kind of comm our design . "
A,Minor,"It's "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly comm you know comm o other people find it really cool . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Background colour . "
A,Elicit,"I don't know or uh I don't know how you "
D,Elicit,"How do you guys feel ? "
C,Task,"I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side comm because you can uh make it in your own "
A,Minor,"Casting . Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"The different designs . "
C,Task,"yes comm you can make it in your own uh "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"more to your own personality or or house style . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but we d we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts comm I believe . "
D,Task,"No comm not not fronts comm but different designs . "
A,Task,"With a colour a co a colours . Oh comm okay . "
B,Task,"No comm not fronts . Different designs . Different colours maybe comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"And that's still uh uh comm yeah comm is is uh is a little personal touch comm I guess . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm but "
A,Task,"Oh comm maybe we should do three or something that w you know comm our "
D,Other,"What ? "
D,Elicit,"Yeah comm wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? Personally . "
C,Other,"Or forty . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Personally . "
B,Task,"We can make it a one . "
D,Task,"Yes comm "
D,Elicit,"but what is it ? "
C,Task,"I think two or three . "
B,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Guido ? "
B,Task,"I agree . "
D,Elicit,"Two or three . "
B,Task,"Um comm I uh I go for the positive . So I go for two . "
D,Minor,"I was "
D,Task,"I was thinking about three comm so I guess "
A,Task,"Uh comm I was thinking about four comm so I think three is uh "
D,Task,"three is uh a bit uh "
B,Task,"Okay comm three . "
D,Other,"oh comm what am I doing ? "
D,Other,"I'll mark it . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah well comm let that let's make that a one . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Two . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"One . One . "
D,Elicit,"Antek comm you agree ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Okay yeah comm I'll I'll agree . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yeah . You're not Antek . "
A,Task,"That's one thing for sure . "
B,Task,"I'm the I'm the usability comm so "
D,Task,"I totally agree . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm two or a one comm I guess . "
B,Minor,"The "
A,Task,"It's something we really put work into . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I yeah . "
D,Task,"I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . "
C,Task,"It's all about the buttons . "
D,Minor,"And our oh yeah comm it's a b yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah ? Alright . "
D,Elicit,"That's a one ? You agree ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . "
D,Task,"I think we totally succeeded there . "
A,Minor,"But "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"Well maybe a two comm because of the menu button or something . "
D,Other,"Oh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm well menu Yeah comm maybe . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . That's true . "
A,Minor,"And telete "
C,Task,"Also comm the the the buttons of the one comm the two comm the the digits comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we don't know if the uh they're necessary . "
C,Minor,"o they're used uh uh "
D,Minor,"the the "
D,Task,"yeah comm m well comm you d you've got a point . "
A,Task,"I think a two . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm true . Yeah comm I agree . "
C,Minor,"Can "
C,Task,"yes comm three comm two . "
A,Task,"Came a long way comm but not we didn't not uh "
D,Elicit,"Two or three ? "
B,Task,"Mm two . "
D,Elicit,"Two ? Antek . "
C,Task,"But you can't make a remote control without them comm "
B,Minor,"Because we got "
C,Minor,"because "
D,Task,"Nay that that that's true comm that's true . They're definitely needed . "
A,Task,"No comm w w it can also always be more simplistic comm but two is "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"we put it on a two ? "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control has got a really trendy look . "
C,Task,"Yes . A one . "
D,Elicit,"Maarten . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm uh a t I think a two . "
B,Minor,"Well . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah comm y i it's hard to say from this picture . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"We "
C,Task,"we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Ever comm yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Guido . "
A,Minor,"But I do think it's more "
B,Task,"Uh comm I will I will make it a three comm "
B,Minor,"because uh yeah . I I th "
A,Task,"But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm uh I agree . I agree . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"So so I think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the "
B,Task,"Yeah . True comm yeah . "
D,Task,"I was planning to give it a two comm uh where I give the not ugly uh "
A,Task,"A th a three . "
D,Task,"oh comm yeah comm that's true . "
D,Elicit,"You agree on the two ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"I i uh when you compare to the "
D,Task,"Great . "
D,Elicit,"Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . "
A,Elicit,"Uh uh what's the difference with "
D,Task,"Uh comm I copied that one . "
D,Task,"Well comm uh forget that . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Other,"Go away . "
D,Elicit,"Remote control has got innovative technology implanted . "
B,Task,"No . We're not "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"No comm not L_C_D_ comm so . "
B,Task,"well comm maybe the the the on the side . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but we uh "
A,Elicit,"you mean the rubber stuff ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm and the light . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . "
B,Task,"And the light maybe . "
C,Task,"But that that's not innovative . "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"And I don't u also it's also really not innovative comm "
D,Minor,"Well comm I g "
C,Minor,"Lights lights are "
A,Minor,"it's more "
D,Minor,"It's not "
D,Task,"seven ? "
A,Task,"No comm six . "
B,Task,"Well comm six . "
A,Task,"Or seven maybe comm yeah . "
B,Task,"No comm six . "
C,Task,"Six . "
A,Task,"Or six . "
D,Elicit,"Why uh why not a seven ? "
B,Minor,"Six . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm mine is seven . "
C,Task,"Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"but it but it "
D,Elicit,"How ? "
A,Minor,"Uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe "
C,Task,"With the lights it it's it's kind of future "
A,Task,"No comm I think I think actually it's a seven maybe comm but there's nothing innovative about it . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah comm you think the lights are innovative ? "
D,Task,"Well comm it's n true . Uh comm I agree comm "
D,Minor,"m but "
C,Task,"But still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone comm with the with "
B,Elicit,"Innovative in generally or just f original for "
D,Minor,"I'll "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you you didn't draw the docking station . "
C,Task,"Yes . The docking station is a is a little bit innovative . "
A,Task,"N no no comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm it it's I think I think with its "
A,Minor,"t . "
B,Task,"A docking station is innova "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm I mean the dock station comm but but uh comm "
A,Task,"I think the the docking station comm it's gonna be a kind of a problem . "
C,Task,"It's a part of the remote . "
D,Minor,"I think more m "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And with the speaker on the there's also a speaker . "
A,Minor,"But "
D,Minor,"Uh that that's n "
A,Task,"Well comm let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what comm because we have to reevaluate anyway . "
A,Task,"Well I i yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"No ? "
D,Task,"No uh comm well comm the agenda says evaluate now comm so I think we "
A,Task,"Okay comm for now it's a six or a seven uh comm sev "
D,Task,"It's it's a six . "
A,Task,"six maybe comm "
B,Task,"Six . "
A,Minor,"because "
C,Task,"But the retrieval or the "
D,Minor,"That m f "
D,Task,"Yeah comm for the retrieval function . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but I don't I don't know if it's very inno yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . I think that's very innovative for a remote control . "
C,Minor,"Yes comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm v "
C,Elicit,"how would you innovate a remote control more ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and "
C,Other,"To put it on your head . "
A,Task,"no no comm "
A,Other,"you know what I mean . "
A,Minor,"You have "
A,Task,"must be innovative technology for remote controls comm but more in how you control stuff comm not in how you find your "
D,Task,"Yeah sure comm "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm it's "
D,Task,"But I d I definitely don't think it's a five comm "
A,Minor,"that's that's "
A,Task,"think about it la later on "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"and uh "
D,Elicit,"Remote control is easy to use . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm as a a one or a two ma uh at least . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm a two . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"I think a two . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's good . "
B,Minor,"More two . "
D,Other,"Come on . "
D,Minor,"The remote control hasn't got uh . "
A,Task,"No comm I would have seen that one before . "
A,Task,"Oh comm you skipped one uh "
D,Minor,"I've just filled uh "
A,Task,"Uh comm here . "
D,Other,"Go away . "
C,Other,"You like the buttons . "
D,Task,"I found twelve questions so much comm but it still is ten . "
A,Elicit,"Remote control will be bought by "
D,Elicit,"It will be bought by people under the age of forty . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Definitely . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"In in "
A,Elicit,"Well "
C,Elicit,"and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ? "
D,Task,"No no no . No comm just if they if they buy it . "
A,Task,"Uh comm just in general . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm a two . "
C,Task,"We don't know . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but I think I think two . "
C,Minor,"But "
D,Elicit,"Yeah comm what do you think ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think two comm yeah . I agree . Two . "
D,Elicit,"Antek ? "
C,Task,"Yes comm two comm but only in c when you compare it with with elderly . "
A,Task,"Uh comm that is not the question . It's just w it will be bought by people under forty . "
D,Task,"No comm that's no comparison . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm you can "
A,Task,"yeah comm you can be very picky about it . "
D,Task,"And I don't mean two people . "
C,Task,"This is just guessing . "
A,Task,"Ah yeah comm just make it we'll make it a two . "
C,Task,"Make it a two . "
D,Minor,"W w "
C,Task,"When it succeeds comm uh it can get a two comm "
C,Minor,"mu "
D,Minor,"Right comm the rem "
D,Elicit,"The remote control has recognisable corporate image comm colour comm logo or slogan . "
A,Other,"Oh no . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah comm you have make an "
B,Task,"We don't have the slogan though . "
A,Task,"slogan is quite obvious . "
D,Other,"Oh comm the slogan . "
A,Task,"Oh the oh sorry comm no comm not not the slogan . "
D,Elicit,"Can we see the slogan ? "
B,Task,"The logo . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm you can put that on the side if if we would like to . "
C,Task,"A logo . "
B,Task,"Underneath it or something . "
C,Other,"Yes comm uh encrypted uh with "
A,Task,"Yeah comm and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . "
D,Elicit,"Are we gonna do that ? "
B,Task,"A three . Three . "
A,Task,"Maybe a three this time . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm a three . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Three ? I agree . "
D,Task,"Because of the slogan "
A,Minor,"And uh "
D,Elicit,"Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users . "
A,Task,"Uh comm it's a one or a two . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm two . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Elicit,"Two ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm make it a two . "
B,Task,"Two . "
D,Task,"Two . Alright . "
D,Task,"We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . "
D,Other,"Four comm five comm seven comm nine . Forget that . Fifteen comm seventeen comm twenty one comm twenty four comm twenty six . "
D,Task,"Twenty six . "
D,Task,"It's a two point six . "
A,Task,"It's not that bad . "
D,Minor,"Alright comm we "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm and that's mostly the inno "
A,Task,"when we uh score higher on innovative technology comm we would score two comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . True . "
A,Task,"which is uh quite a great score . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm this is was uh the evaluation ? "
D,Task,"This was my evaluation . So "
A,Minor,"Because I I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has "
D,Task,"We did a pretty nice job until now . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm is this your "
C,Elicit,"Is there something after this uh meeting ? Or "
D,Other,"Whatever . "
D,Task,"Well comm I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire . "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Still opened or uh "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm finance . Because um "
B,Other,"Shoot . "
A,Task,"I received uh a spreadsheet . "
D,Task,"A five . A five . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but I uh actually don't need this presentation comm I guess . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Doesn't matter . "
A,Task,"I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together comm "
A,Task,"because I didn't really fin uh I have a . "
A,Task,"Didn't really finish it . "
A,Task,"Well comm we uh We'll see . We'll stumble upon some problems . "
D,Task,"We probably will . "
A,Task,"I probably have already opened it here . "
A,Task,"try it again . "
A,Task,"First of all comm the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . "
A,Task,"But let's let's st start with beginning . "
A,Task,"We include one battery . "
A,Other,"I i uh I'll explain "
A,Minor,"its Uh comm the "
A,Task,"the components are listed over here . "
A,Task,"Uh comm price is given . "
A,Minor,"We um yeah comm "
D,Task,"The amount comm yeah . "
A,Task,"we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component comm how much we need of them . "
A,Task,"And then uh comm we'll uh calcula "
A,Task,"Don't watch the number yet . "
A,Task,"I don't know if it's filled in properly . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we need one battery . "
A,Task,"One battery . I think one battery is enough . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"We don't need kinetic comm solar cells comm hand dynamo . "
A,Task,"A s okay comm this this is a p first problem . "
A,Task,"Uh comm I think "
A,Elicit,"we should know how many simple chips comm regular chips "
C,Task,"Uh it's it's one one chip comm but but you have to choose one from it . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"The simple chip is e enough I I think comm "
C,Task,"but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval comm it can be uh "
D,Task,"I don't know "
A,Elicit,"Where did we find this information ? "
D,Task,"I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use comm really . "
A,Minor,"Was it "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"uh I "
A,Task,"I think it was uh your job in the first uh meet Uh comm f your first presentation to make this clear comm but then you had some t time problems . "
B,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"my my my uh "
C,Task,"The the email I got said uh simple chip comm but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device comm it will uh cost a a bit more comm like I think the advanced chip maybe . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"And how do you know ? "
D,Elicit,"I mean comm you got that email . Did it point out what to use them for ? "
C,Task,"Bec No comm the they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . "
A,Task,"Maybe you can uh look it up right now . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm but okay . "
A,Elicit,"When we don't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside comm what "
C,Task,"Then it's a simple chip . "
A,Task,"then it would be a simple chip . "
A,Task,"And with the retriever comm it would be an advanced chip . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
D,Task,"Alright comm "
C,Minor,"I I I s I "
D,Task,"well comm point out the advanced chip for now comm I guess . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"That will be enough for future uh recommendations . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . "
A,Task,"The sample sensor sample speaker . "
A,Elicit,"What is it m is that the speaker we were t "
A,Task,"I don't know what it is . "
C,Task,"I don't know it uh either . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we went for the double-curved case "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"made out of plastic and rubber . And with a special colour . "
A,Task,"I guess that's what we were "
B,Task,"Well comm special colour . . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I don't know about the special colour comm "
C,Task,"Otherwise comm you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . "
A,Minor,"but I think w uh "
D,Task,"I don't know if it's very special . "
B,Minor,"I don't "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think we uh we have special colours . "
B,Minor,"Mm okay . "
C,Task,"Standard rubber . "
D,Task,"Alright comm that's okay . "
A,Task,"Okay comm then the push-button comm I was just counting them . "
C,Minor,"St "
A,Task,"Uh comm I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use comm "
A,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
B,Other,"Whoa comm "
B,Minor,"it's a little "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Well that's bit of a problem comm "
A,Task,"because I re but I really don't understand that comm because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons comm and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet . "
B,Task,"That's huge . "
B,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"We have the simplest buttons . "
D,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"it's only uh when you use push-buttons comm it will cost that much . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't think so comm because it says amount . "
C,Minor,"If you use a scroll-wheel "
A,Minor,"Ah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm it wouldn't "
D,Minor,"The the the yellow row is the amount of "
A,Task,"Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
C,Task,"Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . "
A,Minor,"I "
C,Task,"You can have f four kind of push-buttons . "
C,Task,"Rubber . "
B,Task,"Uh comm one til nine . "
C,Minor,"You can have uh "
B,Elicit,"Is that one or is that nine buttons ? "
A,Task,"And I count them like this . "
A,Other,"One two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Because Oh comm this is "
A,Task,"oh comm this is one comm okay . "
A,Task,"Twelve comm "
A,Task,"okay comm then it would be eighteen comm because uh comm I uh rated them as uh um "
D,Minor,"To n "
A,Task,"as uh uh uh separate buttons . "
D,Task,"that's total of four buttons . "
C,Minor,"Different comm "
C,Task,"yes . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"And plus these two comm f uh plus the mute button comm and it's will be uh eighteen . "
D,Minor,"I think that "
D,Task,"Eighteen . "
D,Other,"One two three four five comm si "
C,Elicit,"Why is that so uh expensive . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I don't understand . "
A,Task,"Y I do I don't get the point comm because it's would be s relatively so expensive comm just these m small buttons . "
B,Elicit,"Is it cents comm the the the fifty cents a button ? "
D,Task,"Fifty cents for one single stupid button . "
C,Minor,"So comm whe when you so then it "
B,Task,"No way . "
A,Task,"Well comm okay comm well well let's make it just one . "
C,Task,"It's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of "
A,Task,"Here comm now it's now it's already s "
D,Task,"Yeah comm exactly . Yeah . "
A,Task,"shall we just "
A,Task,"give our own interpretation to comm "
A,Task,"because else we would really have a problem . "
A,Task,"It would be impossible to make it "
D,Minor,"I can't "
D,Task,"I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . Really . "
B,Minor,"It's way "
C,Task,"When you have the same amount of button comm you have to put in wi in your carton . Board . "
A,Task,"And and less buttons than this isn't possible . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
C,Task,"And then throw it "
A,Task,"This is the most simple "
B,Task,"No comm no no . "
A,Task,"yeah comm it is possible comm "
A,Task,"but I've never seen one before . "
C,Minor,"But whe "
C,Task,"I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah comm only with uh page up comm page down and volume comm "
D,Task,"No comm really . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm without the numbers . That's possible . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm uh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we could skip the numbers . "
C,Minor,"but but "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really . "
B,Task,"That's still four . "
C,Task,"Uh comm it's it's still for little children . "
C,Task,"They can handle that remote control comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"but but it isn't fo "
A,Task,"Then uh comm teletext would also be im impossible . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Minor,"it's for it's li uh it's just for a little "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's no option comm that's no option . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm we'll we'll just "
A,Task,"okay . "
A,Task,"But then still comm when we there's no room for a docking station or something . "
A,Minor,"Tha w Le "
A,Task,"let's see th we have uh oh yeah comm button supplements . "
A,Task,"We'll give the buttons special colour . "
A,Task,"We'll give them a special form . "
A,Task,"Uh comm I think we should mark the special form thing comm "
A,Task,"because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons comm I guess . "
B,Elicit,"A special colour comm why a special colour ? "
A,Task,"Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . "
B,Task,"But wha what s what special ? "
C,Minor,"Otherwise comm it "
A,Task,"I think that's the what they mean by a special colour . "
B,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Otherwise it would be the "
D,Task,"I don't think the special form is really true . "
B,Task,"Uh comm yeah . "
A,Task,"I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here comm because that's what we were planning to do comm "
A,Minor,"making it "
C,Task,"Special form also comm it says . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm special material r also comm "
D,Elicit,"Is it ? "
A,Task,"because i has rubber . And the buttons have to be rubber . "
C,Elicit,"What is the normal material ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I dunno . "
B,Task,"Plastic . "
C,Minor,"Sh yeah . "
B,Task,"Plastic comm I think . "
C,Other,"Classic ? "
B,Task,"Plastic . "
D,Task,"Plastic . "
C,Other,"Oh comm plastic . "
A,Task,"'Kay comm but the problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station in this list comm "
A,Task,"but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station "
A,Task,"Separately . "
B,Task,"Se no no no . "
C,Task,"yes . "
C,Minor,"And and "
C,Task,"but we don't have to tell it comm "
C,Task,"but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but I do like the idea comm but we yeah . "
A,Minor,"It uh but it "
A,Task,"then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore comm "
A,Minor,"but we can "
D,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"No comm but you otherwise you can't retrieve it . "
A,Task,"but then you still have to use "
A,Task,"we have to find out what chip we u need . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I really don't get it . "
D,Task,"I mean if it's a simple chip comm then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents . "
A,Task,"I think we can agree on this . "
A,Task,"I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . "
A,Minor,"'Cause I think we uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yep . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think that's what what what they uh mean "
C,Task,"But for two Euros and thirty cents comm we uh we don't get a docking station . "
D,Task,"I think so comm too . "
D,Task,"Oh comm I don't know . "
A,Task,"But can we find out uh about uh this chips ? "
A,Task,"Because when we don't need a d a docking station comm then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip . "
B,Task,"And then we can get a docking station . "
A,Task,"And maybe then we can do something extra . "
C,Minor,"For "
A,Other,"Oh comm n uh oh comm still "
A,Task,"oh comm it's gonna get more expensive with . Two . "
A,Task,"Then we have some money left . "
A,Minor,"We can put then "
C,Task,"For two Euros . "
A,Task,"We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm well who knows . "
D,Elicit,"Uh why ? "
D,Minor,"I mean i i if you "
A,Task,"Or a little bit of tin titanium . "
D,Task,"if it would cost two Euros comm that had a total a total thing comm it would be nice too comm "
D,Task,"I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it . "
B,Elicit,"But what what can we do "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"or we can ki do the kinetic cells . "
A,Task,"That's also maybe an idea . "
B,Elicit,"But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? "
A,Task,"Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . "
A,Task,"Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now comm "
A,Minor,"then we know "
B,Minor,"If if i "
A,Task,"then we exactly know what it will cost us . "
A,Minor,"Maybe is that "
A,Task,"that's nice to know . "
B,Other,"Regular chip and "
B,Task,"because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip comm for example . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm bu bu but when we "
D,Task,"I like the hand dynamo part . "
A,Task,"yeah comm but when we skip when we um when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station comm then we still yeah comm we need something else maybe to make it kind of special comm "
A,Task,"because that was our our special feature . "
D,Task,"We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We'll go back uh tomorrow . "
D,Minor,"I mean "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm you can also do that comm "
A,Minor,"but maybe "
D,Task,"Wi wi without recharge "
A,Task,"It still is a special remote control cons uh you know comm wi its form is special and material . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it . "
D,Task,"I mean comm it has a shape . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but for two Euros comm then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip comm "
D,Task,"Of course it has a shape comm but i i "
A,Task,"then two Euros isn't even possible . "
D,Elicit,"Why should that not be possible ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm then "
A,Task,"because then we'd thirty cents left . "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but yeah comm I don't know comm "
A,Minor,"because maybe d uh yeah comm "
A,Task,"we have to find out with the simple chip . "
B,Task,"That's the question . If we do i do we need an advanced chip comm or is it okay f "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"and w and and we uh need f "
C,Task,"It isn't in my information comm so I don't know it uh either . "
A,Elicit,"and what is this ? Sample sensor sample speaker . "
C,Task,"It isn't in my information comm "
C,Minor,"I uh I "
C,Task,"I've got a schematic view of the remote control comm but nothing about uh advanced chips or "
A,Task,"You can look at it for s presentation . "
A,Elicit,"S technical functions ? "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Uh I've got here in uh "
B,Task,"No no comm they were uh mine comm yeah . "
C,Other,"I will put a I will put a page on it . "
A,Task,"Oh . "
C,Task,"When my mouse works again . "
A,Other,"Oh comm oh oh . "
A,Other,"Hey . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"My mouse is uh "
D,Task,"Dead . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Reanimate it . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
B,Minor,"Died . "
C,Task,"Ah comm I've got it . "
C,Other,"I will put uh my email on the the network . "
D,Elicit,"What the hell are these ? "
C,Task,"It's on it . "
D,Other,"Oh comm whatever . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's open . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I don't think here it's in here already . "
B,Task,"It's circuit board . "
B,Task,"It's only just basics for for "
A,Task,"It's nothing about s yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"At the end circuit there is an infrared LED . "
D,Task,"This isn't helpful . "
A,Minor,"No . "
A,Task,"But i in the presentation of yours comm there was also something about different components . "
A,Elicit,"Which one was it ? "
B,Task,"Components design . "
A,Elicit,"Functional requirements ? "
C,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"No comm that was my presentation . "
B,Task,"Components design maybe . "
C,Task,"Yes comm that was mine . "
B,Task,"N on top . "
A,Other,"Ah . "
A,Task,"Ah yes comm it was the second one . "
C,Task,"But that was my second "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it was your second "
D,Task,"It's already open . "
A,Task,"your first presentation . "
D,Task,"It's at the bottom . "
B,Elicit,"Working design . "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
D,Task,"It's uh at your task bar . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but it's the the other one . "
D,Task,"Oh . "
C,Minor,"Mm "
A,Minor,"Uh comm this is n this is not this n "
B,Elicit,"Was it working design or components design ? "
D,Other,"Sorry . "
A,Task,"that's not the right one . "
A,Minor,"I don't "
A,Other,"oh . "
D,Other,"Okay comm sorry . "
A,Task,"No comm this is the other one . "
A,Minor,"Or maybe something is uh "
A,Task,"maybe there's something abo in in these "
B,Elicit,"Chip set . "
C,Minor,"But this is the same uh "
C,Task,"This is o only the possibilities . "
A,Elicit,"Here . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We can use a simple comm a regular comm or advanced chip . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm nice . I it doesn't say anything . "
B,Task,"The display requires an advanced chip . "
A,Task,"You know that a push-button requires a simple chip comm but a scroll-wheel comm it it me requires "
C,Task,"Ah comm okay . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so we only need a simple chip . "
B,Minor,"Requires . "
C,Elicit,"With the light . "
B,Task,"Little lights . Yeah comm but that that's just the same as the the LED . "
A,Task,"No no comm that's just a simple chip . "
D,Task,"That's not needed . "
A,Minor,"A scroll-wheel "
A,Task,"it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip comm and that a display requires an advanced chip . "
A,Task,"So comm we don't need any of them . "
D,Task,"A display uh is comm of course comm uh for showing letters . For showing text . "
C,Minor,"L_C_D_ . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't think that uh just a l a little light "
B,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
A,Elicit,"And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? "
C,Task,"Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up comm page down . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I guess so too . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm true . "
D,Other,"Next channel . "
B,Task,"Well comm that's not too what we want . "
D,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"Well comm we might want it comm but "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"All in twelve Euros . "
A,Task,"Back to the costs . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Twelve Euros and fifty cents . "
A,Task,"So we're gonna use the simple chip . "
B,Task,"So comm simple chip is okay . "
D,Task,"Great . "
D,Task,"Delete . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"And the lights . Where uh are the lights ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm lights comm yeah comm there's no "
D,Task,"Well comm there're three comm I guess . "
B,Task,"category . "
A,Task,"Nah comm there is some money left to be spent . "
B,Elicit,"Can we do it wi within two two Euro ? "
D,Task,"I think we can make a docking station . Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? "
A,Minor,"But I mean it isn't "
A,Task,"it hasn't got any innovative technology comm "
A,Task,"we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway comm I think . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I don't I don't see any possibility to do so comm because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy . "
B,Task,"But it's original . "
A,Elicit,"But what w is there some extra "
D,Task,"No comm that's true . "
A,Task,"maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something . "
A,Task,"Instead of the rechargeable "
A,Task,"the rechargeable thing was something to um know comm so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore . "
D,Minor,"M bu "
A,Task,"Maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it "
C,Task,"But but sometimes you put a "
A,Task,"Yeah comm you leave the p yeah comm I know comm but still I they will think about that . "
A,Minor,"I mean if you u "
C,Task,"Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking . "
A,Minor,"The uh it's made for s people "
A,Minor,"well comm the they don't "
A,Task,"if it was uh uh r useless technology comm they wouldn't put it uh as a possibility . "
C,Task,"Uh solar cells are useless . "
A,Minor,"And i it it th th the the target "
D,Task,"Or the hand dynamo dynamo "
A,Task,"the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Because I think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source comm then it would be this one . "
A,Task,"Because it's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot "
A,Task,"Hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it comm you know . You don't use batteries . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm but but if we ca "
A,Task,"I've never seen it before in a remote control . "
D,Minor,"I don't know if "
B,Task,"But then we could make a docking station . "
D,Task,"Five minutes . "
A,Task,"No comm we we we can't make a docking station anyway . "
D,Task,"That's not true . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we can als or uh also m we we can make one "
D,Task,"We can make a docking station for two thirty . "
B,Minor,"Wow comm w why no li "
A,Task,"we can still make "
B,Task,"Look at now comm we got two "
D,Task,"Two thirty . "
C,Task,"Fo for a docking station . "
B,Task,"two thirty left . "
D,Task,"We can make a docking station . Sure . "
B,Elicit,"Ca can't we make a docking station of that ? "
C,Elicit,"With a cable comm with uh buttons on it comm with retrieval uh device in it . "
D,Task,"Sure . "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"The power device is is i i is very cheap . "
D,Task,"That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but be serious comm then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . "
C,Minor,"Wi with a button to "
B,Minor,"Well comm we we uh "
D,Task,"So . "
C,Task,"wi with a button to retrieve it comm so it will beep . "
C,Task,"Uh comm so it's uh wireless technology . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff . "
A,Task,"I don't think it's realistic for you to do so . "
D,Task,"Well then it's a useless project . "
C,Task,"Look at the case comm "
A,Minor,"Oh comm because we "
C,Minor,"the case the case of of uh of uh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm then we don't have any innovation things . "
A,Task,"We well look at all the special stuff we have . "
A,Task,"Colour a the colours are special comm the form is special . "
A,Task,"It th this is whole concept . "
A,Task,"Uh maybe it with the kinetic thing comm I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . "
D,Minor,"Can't we uh "
D,Task,"Can't we say fifteen Euros ? "
D,Minor,"No comm sta yeah I mean "
A,Task,"Uh comm no . "
C,Task,"No comm then we have to sell it for thirty Euros . "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No comm we only make less profit of it . "
C,Minor,"It's the "
D,Task,"You can sell for twenty seven and a half . "
D,Task,"Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . "
B,Minor,"No . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm I don "
A,Task,"my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing "
A,Minor,"and make it uh like a "
A,Minor,"Uh uh I I I I still fee "
A,Task,"I also feel this concept of making it kinetic comm "
A,Task,"because of the you know comm it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . "
D,Minor,"I don't think "
C,Task,"Maybe we can uh can do it both . "
C,Task,"Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No comm that wouldn't n no . "
D,Task,"Thirteen twenty . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm and it is also not a good it's not "
A,Task,"you have to really do it only kinetic comm you don't want it to think about batteries anymore . "
D,Minor,"And I think only "
C,Minor,"Yes comm but when it's then when it "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm but only kinetic comm then you gotta "
A,Minor,"No no . "
C,Task,"then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's great . "
D,Task,"You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour comm really . "
A,Task,"No no no . "
A,Task,"No no comm this is very sophisticated technology technology . "
A,Task,"When you use it your remote like once a day comm or maybe even less i i it "
C,Minor,"You asked for three d "
C,Task,"No comm that's n that's not true . "
C,Task,"Uh comm a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . "
D,Minor,"No . "
A,Minor,"It We can make it yeah no . "
A,Minor,"Becau be but a remote control gets "
A,Task,"why do they state that this technology can be used if it "
C,Task,"Yes comm solar cells are also stated . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . "
C,Task,"Why don't we use solar cells then ? "
A,Task,"Because I think the d whole dynamic part comm do you know comm appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy comm you know comm "
A,Task,"with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing comm and y when you move it around a lot comm then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and "
C,Task,"That's true . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it's funny for a week . "
D,Task,"I guess something like that comm where you have to move it around very frequently comm is demotivating . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but you don't have to . "
A,Other,"Trust me . "
A,Task,"The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it comm it just happens . "
D,Task,"No comm I I don't move my uh my remote control very much comm seriously . "
A,Task,"Okay comm then we d Okay comm well y we don't have to do it comm but what that would just have a lack of key features comm you know . "
C,Minor,"Oui . "
A,Task,"You m have to put something on your box . "
A,Task,"You have to make people buy it and uh "
A,Task,"We can really can do the docking thing comm "
A,Minor,"uh it's not "
A,Task,"yeah comm uh we can do it comm but it's would be a easy way out . "
C,Other,"You can do it for fifty cents . "
D,Task,"Well comm we've got more than fifty Cents . "
C,Minor,"The c The case the case alone is is is uh "
A,Task,"Okay comm but we have to grou to agree upon something comm "
A,Task,"because uh we only have a minute left or so . "
C,Task,"the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro . "
C,Task,"Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station . "
A,Task,"No no comm it's not possible . "
A,Task,"Okay comm w b we can s we can leave it on "
A,Minor,"be well then then th it's this is "
A,Task,"then then our concept is ready . "
B,Task,"Cheap remote control . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we make some extra profit of it . "
D,Task,"Yeah . No comm we won't comm but that's um something else . "
C,Minor,"But now "
D,Task,"No comm this not gonna sell . No . "
B,Task,"It w it won't tell comm but "
A,Elicit,"Huh comm any ideas ? "
D,Task,"Of course not . "
B,Task,"No comm uh comm n no "
C,Task,"Great . It's great . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm we just have to go all what we did today again . You have to do it over . "
C,Task,"Our remote control . "
D,Task,"We come back tomorrow comm okay ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"the "
C,Other,"Seventy Euros . "
A,Minor,"I mean we're gonna "
A,Task,"it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel . "
B,Task,"No comm but no . "
A,Task,"That's what it's makes it special . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well comm to give it some just to give it some extra special feature comm "
A,Task,"and uh I know it will work comm "
A,Minor,"but uh it's it's an "
A,Task,"They're they're not putting technologies on this comm but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen . "
C,Elicit,"Why not a hand dynamo then ? "
A,Task,"Okay comm well we leave it like this . "
A,Minor,"Then it's c then we're yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"We can't do anything else . "
D,Task,"Warning comm finish meeting now . "
C,Task,"We're done . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm project e uh "
C,Elicit,"Is this it ? "
A,Task,"well comm we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"No comm we can't . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we have to Yeah comm it's "
B,Minor,"No . "
D,Task,"Yes comm yes . Celebration . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"I don't see why comm but "
C,Other,"Where's the champagne ? "
D,Task,"I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire comm to be honest . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"I don't uh hear a bell . "
D,Task,"No comm not yet . "
D,Task,"Alright comm I'll see you guys in a minute . "
B,Task,"We can do it here then . "
C,Other,"Bye . "
D,Task,"I don't think so . "
B,Minor,"Can we "
B,Elicit,"can't we do it here ? "
D,Task,"I don't know . I don't I don't think so . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Other,"Just fill that one in . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm we're doing now . "
B,Minor,"But it's . "
B,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Task,"Uh comm I don't know . "
B,Task,"Nice . "
