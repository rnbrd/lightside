A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui . "
C,Task,"Um uh my role is industrial designer "
C,Task,"and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the technical-functional designs "
C,Task,"and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design . "
A,Task,"Very good . "
A,Task,"And as you already know I am Betty . "
A,Task,"I am the project manager for today . "
A,Task,"So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Yes y opening comm acquaintance comm tool training "
A,Minor,"well comm the tools are comm I think comm we already "
A,Task,"I guess the tool is really our the computer comm as far as I can see . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions "
A,Task,"and we'll take it from there . "
A,Task,"Project plan comm that falls under the same heading pretty much . "
A,Task,"Um comm I don't think we have any great discussion at this point . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Here is what this thing should be . "
A,Task,"This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . "
A,Task,"Uh should be original comm trendy comm and comm of course comm user friendly . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So maybe you wanna make some notes of that . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"All right . "
A,Task,"Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . "
A,Task,"The same goes for the conceptual design comm "
A,Task,"there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . "
A,Task,"Detailed design comm same thing basically . "
D,Minor,"Mm 'kay so "
D,Task,"Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Functional comm conception and detailed . "
A,Task,"I can't write with this thing . "
D,Other,"Maybe we should redesign it . "
A,Other,"Yes . "
D,Other,"After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"All right ? "
A,Task,"Then comm tool training try out the white board comm "
A,Task,"participant can draw their favourite animal . "
A,Elicit,"Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? "
A,Task,"So that in case we have to comm in the next meeting comm present something on the white board . "
A,Task,"You wanna go Eileen and "
D,Other,"Okay comm I'll see what I can do . "
A,Other,"Whether you without hanging yourself . "
D,Minor,"See if I r "
D,Other,"See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something . "
A,Task,"And remember you have to press so it works . "
D,Task,"So that it will record okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um uh um traditional kitty cat . "
A,Task,"Fat comm a fat cat . "
D,Task,"I've a very fat cat . "
D,Task,"And it likes to sit like that . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And you're Francine comm right ? "
B,Task,"Yes comm I'm Francina . "
A,Task,"Would you like s like just to see um how it feels comm so that you have a little idea ? "
B,Other,"Yes comm sure . "
D,Elicit,"Am I supposed to wipe off that or "
A,Minor,"In "
A,Task,"No comm no . No comm that's okay . "
B,Task,"No comm Okay . "
D,Task,"okay . "
A,Task,"I don't know comm "
A,Task,"we'll get to that later . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"What should I draw ? "
C,Task,"Snake . "
B,Other,"I'm going to draw a snake . "
B,Elicit,"How does it look like ? "
D,Task,"Uh comm okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes . "
A,Task,"Here's the project finance "
A,Task,"uh which comm of course comm we all have to think about when we design this thing . "
A,Task,"Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . "
A,Task,"Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"the market range unlimited meaning international "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro . "
D,Task,"Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Profit . "
D,Other,"Um is fifty mm . "
A,Task,"So these are all things comm of course comm to remember with the budget and when you design "
A,Task,"to materials comm cost comm etcetera . "
A,Elicit,"Now comm uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? "
D,Other,"Oops . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm of course comm using remote control . Yeah . "
A,Task,"I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em comm right comm everyday . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"And um "
A,Elicit,"now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it comm things you would like to change comm things you would like to improve with this thing "
A,Elicit,"ye any first ideas ? "
A,Elicit,"Would you like it to be smaller comm bigger comm "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm I "
A,Elicit,"have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons comm you know comm things like that ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes comm I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . "
A,Task,"Small comm right . Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"those which we get here nowadays it's very long . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And um and it should have multi-purpose . "
B,Task,"Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ comm it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also comm like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners comm or for heating system . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Audio player . "
C,Task,"Oh . Okay . "
A,Task,"So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically . "
B,Task,"Yes comm exactly "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Divides us "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Exactly . "
D,Task,"At um twelve fifty Euros per "
A,Task,"Well . "
D,Task,"Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"We certainly can try to "
D,Task,"I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . "
A,Task,"It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . "
D,Task,"That's right . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm of course . "
A,Task,"Now comm of course comm the other thing to think there is maybe the design . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm design should be comm yeah it should be different . "
B,Minor,"All the almost all the remotes "
A,Task,"Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Yes comm exactly . "
C,Minor,"maybe ten "
A,Task,"Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know . "
C,Task,"I do yeah comm colours "
B,Unlab,"Are different shapes . "
C,Task,"and al shapes also . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Um so yeah shapes right comm you know comm "
A,Task,"like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something comm you know . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah of course yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah okay comm friendly shape comm that would help . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap comm "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it . "
A,Task,"That is true comm "
A,Task,"because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or comm we you know comm whatever . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say comm where the hell is my my remote control yeah ? "
D,Minor,"So some "
A,Task,"Well or yeah or if it's really comm if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm some beep or something like that comm "
D,Task,"Uh so comm so it's really the beep or comm or a light should blink . "
B,Minor,"Or a b "
A,Task,"Yeah . Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"so that we can go "
A,Minor,"So if lost "
A,Task,"If lost uh signal with b throw signal comm you know . "
B,Minor,"Should ha "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"A fluorescent signal comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"maybe it should have a light so that we can comm we can just recognise where it is . "
A,Task,"Exactly comm I mean just that's what I'm saying . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"May not be beep . "
A,Task,"I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or "
C,Task,"Beep or uh it's a light comm maybe it's a light . "
D,Elicit,"And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? "
A,Task,"Okay comm my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden comm in in other words if it's like in a dark spot comm uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top comm a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant comm at that moment it's it's like comm it's like um comm what you call it a light s sensors comm you know ? "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Okay so "
A,Task,"In in that moment it has a sensor comm i it it gets a certain darkness comm it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep comm "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm probably "
A,Task,"I mean comm that we can discuss that later comm you know . "
C,Minor,"yeah comm probably it's a "
C,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"And uh "
D,Task,"So the light sensor would activate the signal . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"You know there would be "
A,Task,"right you have to have some kind of sensor "
A,Task,"and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . "
A,Task,"Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff comm you know comm you can clap on and off comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"but I think they only work to certain degree and "
D,Task,"But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm of course comm "
A,Minor,"What with "
C,Minor,"that didn't "
D,Task,"Well comm because you're s because you're silly . Because people are silly . "
B,Minor,"Then comm in that case "
C,Task,"I i we can't do it . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah well comm but then those people we can't help everybody . "
D,Minor,"I mean it could be on "
D,Task,"well comm i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table "
D,Minor,"um comm "
D,Task,"you know comm well "
A,Minor,"Okay we have uh "
D,Task,"maybe we have to move along comm okay . "
A,Task,"yeah comm we have to move along comm "
A,Task,"but I think we have some good good points to start with here . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm good point . "
A,Task,"Okay comm the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . "
A,Minor,"I think you all "
A,Elicit,"did you get uh notices on your computer for this ? "
C,Task,"Me yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay so well comm you got the notice um "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"uh . The working design comm I guess that's the function "
A,Elicit,"I_D_ uh who is this ? "
A,Task,"The industrial designer That's you . "
C,Unlab,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's functional de yeah comm exactly comm technical . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So comm we looking for a working design when we come back . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh working design comm yeah comm it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design . "
A,Minor,"Then "
A,Task,"And then the technical funct you are the technical function comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm functional design comm "
A,Task,"so so you are the working design . "
C,Minor,"and you "
A,Task,"So you have a working design and then a functional design . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification comm "
A,Task,"like friendliness comm and what we just discussed in general . "
A,Task,"That would be your idea . "
A,Task,"And comm of course comm price . "
A,Task,"That it comm that it comm that the price is a good price . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I mean comm the price is given comm but comm that was "
D,Task,"We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
A,Task,"And comm you know comm specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . "
A,Task,"I think that's the end of the show . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So um we have "
A,Task,"well comm we have a twen two two two three minutes . "
A,Elicit,"Um any questions at this point ? "
A,Elicit,"Or uh suggestions ? "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with "
A,Minor,"and if you have any questions uh comm uh I guess comm you can uh "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay comm I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm even I have . "
D,Elicit,"How about you people ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm even I have comm I think comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Elicit,"Really ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Alright comm well uh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm so let's see . "
A,Task,"Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"And see what we can come up with . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Okay comm very good . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
