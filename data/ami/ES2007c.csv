D,Task,"Oh right okay . "
D,Other,"I cover myself up . "
A,Other,"I feel like Madonna with one of these on . "
A,Other,"I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Task,"I've always wanted one of these comm I really have . "
D,Elicit,"Where do you buy 'em from ? "
D,Minor,"They're . "
A,Other,"Right . Hello everybody . "
C,Other,"Hello . "
A,Other,"Back again for another wonderful meeting . "
B,Minor,". "
A,Elicit,"Is uh everyone ready ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Almost . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we c we can hold on for a minute . "
D,Other,"Oh my gosh . "
A,Task,"I figured with the spam thing comm if you can't beat it comm join in . "
C,Task,"That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . "
B,Task,"Mm 'kay . "
A,Elicit,"Are you ready ? "
A,Minor,"Okay comm right comm well comm "
A,Task,"I take it that you are all ready now . "
A,Task,"Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . "
A,Task,"Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing comm "
A,Task,"and who we all are and stuff like that comm "
A,Task,"mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . "
A,Task,"Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um "
A,Task,"now that we know what it is that we are doing comm now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff "
A,Task,"and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that comm "
A,Task,"that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . "
A,Task,"Um yeah comm we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations comm "
A,Task,"whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Elicit,"Do you have any preference uh of order ? "
A,Minor,"Um I'd like to um hear "
A,Task,"o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . "
A,Minor,"I want "
A,Task,"what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and "
D,Minor,"Batteries . "
C,Task,"I think she is still finishing her . "
B,Task,"No no no no comm it's fine I'm just preparing . "
A,Minor,"It's just that "
A,Task,"yeah comm let's let's hear from you first . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Where is that thing ? "
C,Minor,"Okay comm it's uh "
D,Task,"It's here . "
B,Other,"Oh sorry comm couldn't see . "
B,Elicit,"Would that work ? "
A,Task,"Get yourself in position . "
D,Minor,"Ah . "
B,Other,"Okay comm so that's me again . "
B,Task,"Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery comm "
B,Task,"a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches comm "
B,Task,"if you remember that kind of "
B,Minor,"which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v "
A,Task,"I don't think any of us remember the fifties . "
C,Elicit,"Is it like a crank thing or something . "
B,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"It wouldn't be very fancy . "
B,Task,"You can have a kinetic provision of energy comm "
B,Task,"which is used on some watches these days . "
B,Task,"So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Or you can use solar cells comm "
B,Task,"but I'm not sure about that indoors comm really comm but "
C,Task,"Well comm there's sometimes combinations comm I mean comm like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Do sol solar panel things comm do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I dunno actually . "
A,Elicit,"Does anybody know ? "
C,Task,"Uh I think comm it has to be on the on the solar energy comm but I don't know . "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery comm really . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"And uh if we want something fancier comm I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice comm "
B,Task,"but I don't know if it's worth the cost . "
B,Task,"So we've got to discuss that . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Okay comm jolly good . "
B,Task,"For the case of the remotes itself comm um they can be a general case comm which is just a flat one . "
B,Task,"You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one comm "
B,Elicit,"if you know what I mean comm so "
A,Elicit,"What's a double curved one ? "
B,Task,"You know comm kind of more ergonomic comm that kind of suits the palm of your hand comm that kind of thing . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Um then the case material itself comm so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex comm uh rubber comm wood comm or titanium . "
B,Task,"And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium comm you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case comm we can't choose titanium . "
B,Task,"And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material comm "
B,Task,"so we just have to take that into account . "
B,Task,"But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . "
B,Task,"And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing comm so we could uh "
A,Task,"So that might be an idea of using the rubber comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"but then it should comm you know "
C,Task,"Let's have a squeezable remote . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And also it doesn't break as easily maybe comm "
B,Task,"I dunno "
A,Minor,"when a T_V_ programme's got one "
A,Task,"watching the match and your team's just lost comm you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I like that idea . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"So rubber would be Okay . "
D,Minor,"I think rubber's "
A,Elicit,"Rubber comm we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ? "
A,Elicit,"You think you can market that ? "
D,Task,"But after my after my fashion thing comm I think you'll realise that rubber is more "
B,Minor,"Uh s so if d "
A,Task,"Ooh comm we like rubber comm ooh . "
D,Minor,"People . "
B,Task,"okay . "
B,Task,"And then there are the push-buttons comm "
B,Task,"so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels comm like you have on a mouse comm "
B,Task,"um or you could have um L_C_D_ comm which gives you a display . "
B,Task,"Um scroll buttons comm as well . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"So if you use a rubber double curved case comm you must use rubber push-buttons . "
B,Task,"So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . "
B,Task,"Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . "
B,Task,"So it's a constraint . "
A,Task,"Well comm we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so "
B,Elicit,"Yeah comm but is it a double curved one or not ? "
B,Task,"If it's not a double curved comm then we've got the choice for the push-buttons comm "
B,Task,"if it's a double curve comm we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . "
B,Elicit,"If that makes sense . "
A,Elicit,"push buttons instead of the wheel ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . . "
C,Elicit,"If it's rubber comm isn't it malleable anyway comm "
C,Task,"it doesn't matter if it's double "
C,Elicit,"I mean isn't a rubber case comm mean it's completely flexed comm I mean comm it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? "
C,Elicit,"Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? "
B,Task,"No comm but na le you see comm you've got comm okay comm the energy that's one thing comm "
A,Other,"rubble double double . "
A,Other,"I'll have a Big Mac comm please . "
B,Task,"then you have the case is uh comm whether it's flat or curved . "
B,Minor,"And that's "
B,Task,"we don't care if it's rub rubber or not comm "
B,Task,"but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . "
B,Task,"So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat comm single curved or double curved . "
B,Task,"And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go "
B,Task,"I dunno why comm "
B,Task,"but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So comm either "
B,Task,"I dunno "
B,Task,"we just need to decide on the on the case . "
A,Task,"Let's have rubber push buttons comm hey . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way . "
B,Other,"Let's go crazy . "
B,Other,"And then comm do I have a last slide ? "
B,Task,"Yes comm I do . "
B,Task,"Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be "
B,Task,"so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um and the price that go with it with it comm "
B,Task,"so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . "
B,Task,"Uh if we get a scroll-wheel comm that's a higher price range . "
B,Task,"If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ comm the display thing comm then that's even more expensive . "
A,Other,"Simple comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Chip on print . It's a bit . "
A,Other,"Okay comm uh what I'm not understanding here "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"is uh comm okay comm advanced chip on print comm which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? "
B,Minor,". "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"The infra-red . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? "
A,Minor,"Y um "
A,Elicit,"what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? "
B,Task,"Well comm if if it's not chip on print then comm I guess comm you get different chip components comm and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . "
B,Task,"It's less expensive mm "
A,Minor,"so it sounds "
B,Task,"Technically speaking comm it's not as advanced comm but it does the job comm too . "
A,Elicit,"So comm why would we not go for that ? "
A,Task,"If it's something that's inside the the unit . I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . "
B,Minor,"Fo "
B,Task,"It doesn't comm yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Totally . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um we wanna go for an i i all "
B,Task,"So let's not go for the "
A,Task,"so long as it works comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . I agree . "
A,Other,"you know . "
A,Task,"So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print . "
B,Task,"So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"S yeah comm push buttons . "
D,Elicit,"What about the just developed uh sample sensor ? "
C,Minor,"I think push-buttons is "
A,Other,"What about what ? "
D,Task,"G there comm the sample sensor comm sample speaker thing . "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Elicit,"Well comm what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? "
D,Task,"Mm comm I dunno . "
D,Task,"Be cool . "
B,Task,"It'd be it'd be cool comm but they are saying they've just developed it comm "
D,Other,"Channel two . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option comm probably and "
A,Minor,"S "
C,Task,"Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"'cause uh "
A,Task,"It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product . "
C,Task,"The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine comm "
C,Task,"where comm basically comm you can program a sample wi um That when you say something it will give a response comm "
C,Task,"and you program the response as well . "
C,Task,"Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . "
C,Task,"So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say comm good morning comm to it it says comm hello Rick comm or whatever . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"But comm I mean comm it's not "
C,Task,"it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like comm turn the T_V_ on comm and i turns comes on comm "
B,Minor,"Hm . "
C,Task,"but it's not that . "
C,Minor,"It just gives you "
D,Other,"Oh comm it just gives an answer . "
C,Task,"a it just gives you a verbal response . "
C,Task,"So comm yeah comm I mean comm like what's the point of saying comm Hello remote comm I mean comm hello comm how how are you ? "
D,Minor,"Oh comm then then "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I thought I thought it was when they said "
B,Other,"Just if you are really lonely comm maybe . "
C,Other,"Yeah comm if you're really lonely comm it is it's "
D,Task,"I thought when they said comm voice recognition comm they meant um like comm "
B,Task,"Channel five . And then it switches on . "
D,Task,"channel five comm and it will change . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"tha that w that w that would be more promising . "
D,Task,"Like you talk to it . "
D,Other,"Can I have channel five ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It it's just a remote that talks to you . "
C,Task,"Uh . I mean to certain cues . "
D,Task,"Oh comm then forget about it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Oh right okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Okay comm so I'll go back comm maybe comm to the previous slide "
B,Task,"and we can decide for each problem comm what we should choose . "
B,Elicit,"So for the energy source comm do we go for the battery or the "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I'm fine with the basic battery . "
A,Task,"Basic battery . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"It's cheap comm it's cheerful comm it's worked comm does work . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Cheaper option . "
B,Task,"Are you happy with that ? "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . So we'll go for the battery . "
B,Elicit,"Then the case comm do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? "
A,Elicit,"We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber comm weren't we ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"so we want it rub rubber double curved . "
A,Minor,"The the "
D,Task,"So it will look like something like this . "
B,Elicit,"Double ? "
A,Other,"The double whopper comm please . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so then if we use double curved case comm then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons comm "
A,Minor,"Yep comm "
A,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"we're going for the simple buttons . "
C,Task,"So rubber rubber keys comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and that's fine ? "
A,Task,"And it's cheapest all round comm "
A,Task,"it sounds kinda funky comm "
A,Task,"and we can also market it "
B,Minor,"P "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"as i 'cause we were s saying earl "
A,Task,"you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_ comm and this is anti-R_S_I_ . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So that's another marketing point that we can use . "
D,Task,"Well the rubber push-buttons . Don't you have to move your "
A,Task,"But anything is gonna have buttons . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Even if it's a jog wheel comm it's still repetitive . "
B,Task,"I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a "
A,Minor,"You "
A,Task,"You see comm you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury comm whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . "
B,Task,"That they don't . "
A,Task,"It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,". "
A,Task,"It's not actually what you are doing . "
A,Task,"But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm the rubber's good . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We're giving them a way to burn off steam comm basically comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm so they can sit there and go like "
C,Task,"Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful . "
A,Task,"And you know comm yeah comm you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah . "
C,Task,"Oh yeah comm I guess T_V_ can be stressful comm yeah comm if you're watching sports . "
B,Task,"Alright comm that's me done . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Okay comm Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface . "
C,Other,"Alright . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about . "
A,Task,"Great . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Other,"Okay comm so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . "
C,Task,"And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . "
C,Task,"It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . "
C,Task,"Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um comm "
C,Task,"'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products comm uh like the coffee machine . "
C,Task,"So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . "
C,Task,"I guess comm we we basically vetoed that idea . "
C,Task,"It's it's pointless . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . "
C,Task,"It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . "
C,Minor,"Uh so yeah comm they they also give the uh "
C,Task,"they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Um so we've already addressed that "
C,Task,"and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ "
C,Task,"I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"That does get annoying . "
C,Task,"Um the other suggestion comm "
C,Task,"and I I have a feeling that "
C,Task,"we're interested in in something more general comm "
C,Task,"but they suggested uh comm you know comm going i a little bit into a a niche comm "
C,Task,"like either gearing our remote towards kids comm "
C,Task,"where you could have lot of colours um comm the keys might be you know comm funny or or comm "
C,Task,"or uh something for the elderly comm where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But you know we can we can discuss this comm "
C,Task,"but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general comm but done well . "
C,Minor,"Uh um "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So comm the key layout and design are really crucial . "
C,Minor,"You don't want uh "
C,Task,"you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . "
C,Task,"And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last "
C,Other,"I can give you an example here of uh comm good layout and bad layout "
C,Minor,"uh "
C,Other,"from our manufacturing department . "
C,Task,"So this would be an example of bad layout comm "
C,Task,"where you have volume up and volume down comm but they have a V_ on both of them comm so uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"it's sort of confusing for the user . "
C,Task,"Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . "
A,Elicit,"Do we have an uh example of a good one ? "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"Brilliant . "
D,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"And for something for kids . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Um . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And so comm "
C,Task,"yeah comm I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . "
C,Task,"Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . "
C,Task,"I think it should be more general . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . "
C,Task,"And comm yeah comm that's it for me . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Well let's um "
A,Elicit,"so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? "
A,Minor,"The um "
A,Elicit,"The the um the interface type we're going for "
C,Task,"So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . "
A,Task,"Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . "
C,Task,"So comm yeah comm it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um . "
C,Task,"I think we shall have a limited number of buttons comm "
C,Task,"ideally comm I mean a a power comm channel up comm channel down comm volume up comm volume down comm and a numerical keypad . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Minor,"And some sort of "
C,Task,"it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"and we're not yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well now that we've decided on our "
A,Minor,"Are we gonna hav hav an are we d "
A,Elicit,"have we decided on whether "
A,Elicit,"w we're gonna s supplement it with anything comm "
A,Task,"you know comm colours or particular gimmicky bits to it comm "
A,Elicit,"we're not we're just gonna go for something "
C,Task,"Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy comm "
A,Minor,"We're "
D,Minor,"Maybe we can "
C,Minor,"but um "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere comm "
C,Task,"like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow comm or something like that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Okay . Okey-dokey . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I don't have any other questions on this . "
A,Minor,"Let's move over to "
C,Task,"I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . "
C,Task,"I mean comm 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"But I think that should be "
C,Other,"I mean um comm I can speak with the button department comm "
C,Task,"but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm the button that just does that comm yeah . "
C,Task,"So that should be simple . "
A,Task,"Cool . "
D,Task,"Right . "
D,Other,"Well comm I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets "
A,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
D,Other,"and what the fashions are for next year . Um . "
D,Minor,"So yes comm "
D,Task,"so from looking at this year's trends and fashions "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market comm "
D,Task,"we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to "
D,Task,"which we've already probably discussed . "
D,Task,"Um the most important aspect is look and feel . "
D,Task,"So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . "
D,Minor,"So it has to be "
A,Task,"Yeah comm why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ? "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um second comm uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"What's that mean ? "
D,Task,"Technologically it should be like um work comm basically comm I guess . It should work . "
C,Task,"Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense comm "
D,Minor,"Should "
C,Task,"I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . "
D,Task,"That's new . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already comm that's cheap . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Actually comm I mean comm these first two points we've already sort of gone away from comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"'cause our rubber one is not fancy "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean it's different comm but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . "
C,Task,"If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction . "
C,Task,"And it's it's not technologically innovative either . "
D,Minor,"So comm no loose "
A,Minor,"Maybe we could um "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"That's why I was thinking comm Bluetooth comm "
D,Task,"'cause if you like put up Bluetooth comm and it's like a Bluetooth remote control comm everybody's gonna like comm oh comm "
D,Task,"'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays comm like it really is comm "
D,Minor,"like people "
D,Task,"and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for comm "
D,Task,"they don't really care whether comm you know comm at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . "
A,Task,"Of course comm they do . "
D,Task,"Well comm they do comm but it's like it's not "
A,Task,"One hundred per cent comm that's your first thing comm you go comm oh I'm not gonna buy that comm 'cause I dunno if it works or not . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but it looks good . "
D,Task,"If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration . "
A,Task,"Okay comm well comm "
A,Elicit,"what do you two think about this ? "
C,Elicit,"So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other "
D,Minor,"But like "
C,Elicit,"electronics ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm what I don't understand what m "
D,Task,"You could always insert comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's basically what it allows you to do comm "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"and it this is just gonna "
A,Task,"all this is being used for is your television . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but comm I mean comm people like "
A,Minor,"It would "
A,Task,"that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it comm which no no television does comm "
D,Task,"Well comm if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people comm you have to make it new comm you have to make it state of the art . "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Elicit,"does it ? "
A,Task,"That would mean we'd have to make a television as well . "
B,Task,"Bluetooth would comm for example comm enable you comm I think comm to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone comm but your mobile phone is downstairs or something comm you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . "
B,Task,"Things like that . "
A,Task,"No comm that would be your telephone in with your television . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm the that wouldn't be the remote so much comm "
B,Task,"No i "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I mean "
B,Task,"No comm but if you get Bluetooth on the remote comm you'd be able to "
A,Minor,"and i "
A,Task,"Nah comm the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible comm basically . "
B,Task,"I with the television comm yeah . "
B,Task,"I was just trying to find an advantage . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"Wha what w what advantage would you get for the "
D,Minor,"Well comm it doesn't "
A,Task,"An and there is no there is no such thing "
D,Task,"Like it doesn't have to be comm you know comm Bluetooth comm "
D,Task,"that was just an idea comm "
D,Task,"but like it needs do something that comm you know comm is new . "
D,Task,"Whether it's a battery "
D,Task,"it could be something really really minor comm you know comm like "
D,Task,"but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there comm and people've already seen it comm people've already got it . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"If we want something new comm we need to move away from what we already have "
D,Task,"and um just go creative . "
B,Task,"Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . "
B,Task,"It's been done for watches comm but I haven't seen that for remotes comm yet . "
A,Task,"Okay . Yeah comm this that's that's very good . "
D,Task,"And then you can market it . "
D,Task,"Never have to change a battery again . "
B,Task,"Change the batteries ever again . "
A,Task,"And and this is all tying in very nicely . "
A,Task,"The fact that it's made out of this rubber comm we can throw it about . "
A,Task,"Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about comm because it charges itself up by doing it . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"well comm and in little characters you say comm yeah comm but not too much . "
C,Minor,"Yes comm so can "
D,Minor,"I think comm safety s "
A,Minor,"But yeah comm by the squeezing it the "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's a great idea . Well done . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use . "
D,Task,"And I think we've all um worked that out . "
C,Task,"we're all about that . "
D,Task,"Um okay comm in the fashion comm how it's supposed to look . "
D,Task,"Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths comm shoes and furniture . "
D,Task,"So next year people will be buying comm "
D,Task,"I found this really funny comm "
D,Task,"you know comm strawberry shaped chairs comm "
C,Task,"Okay comm so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Rubber things . "
A,Other,"I wanna watch the pineapple channel . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy comm "
D,Task,"so it's it's not quite spongy comm but spongy comm I would say is "
C,Minor,". "
A,Task,"Well spongy comm that's where . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we're we're ahead of the game there . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's great for us . "
D,Task,"yeah comm so we're in . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel comm "
D,Task,"while still keeping to the company's image comm basically . "
D,Other,"So yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,". I had to say "
D,Task,"So we're moving in the right direction like "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Alright comm yeah comm no comm this i this is good comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"so through all that we've we go we're "
A,Task,"right comm we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's great . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"that's great comm "
A,Task,"using the spongy rubber that we were talking about "
A,Task,"that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself comm you are charging the batteries comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I don't know how we incorporate "
B,Task,"No vegetables . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Task,"We don't have to follow every trend comm I guess . "
D,Task,"Maybe make it like fruity colours or something . "
D,Minor,"Some sort . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"Or "
C,Task,"The power button could be like a big apple or something . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Well yeah comm but Apple would sue you for that . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm this is true . "
C,Task,"They don they don't own all images of apples . "
B,Task,"sued the Beatles so "
C,Task,"Okay comm we'll make it a uh pomegranate comm a big pomegranate . "
A,Task,"Well comm okay comm it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image . "
A,Task,"Like comm yeah comm we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables comm but we dunno what it should be comm "
C,Minor,". "
A,Elicit,"or like are we going yeah it looks slick comm but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"I think comm if it's rubber it needs to be "
A,Task,"I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky . "
D,Task,"different . "
D,Minor,"I think comm it's it should be "
D,Elicit,"I mean comm what do you associate with rubber ? "
D,Task,"You know like "
D,Task,"really different colours basically . "
A,Other,"L keep it clean comm keep it clean . "
D,Other,"Okay comm sor I sorry comm I used the wrong word comm "
D,Elicit,"what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Um like I'm just thinking bright colours . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Bright natural colours comm "
D,Task,"nothing too "
A,Task,"Bright comm but not too bright . "
D,Minor,"Bright comm but too not "
D,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . "
D,Task,"Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like "
A,Elicit,"Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that comm do you mean ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And on the back of it have the logo . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"what ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Sure . "
B,Task,"Why not ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"The one thing I'm wondering about comm I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having "
A,Minor,"Tha "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I mean we that's we we "
C,Task,"I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes comm and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"This is the remote control tomato . "
C,Elicit,"I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? "
D,Task,"Well "
D,Task,"I can say in this country comm you'll get comm you know comm lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . "
D,Minor,"Like "
D,Task,"and kids will be walking in with their parents saying comm Mummy I wanna buy that one . "
D,Task,"And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well comm because it's um "
D,Task,"like kids won't break it comm it's not breakable if you throw it around . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Especially with younger kids comm you know they can pick it up and and "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it comm but "
A,Task,"Well comm it's it's gotta be chew proof . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Other,"I'm gonna write that down . "
D,Minor,"so it's rea it's quite "
D,Task,"it's quite like um user friendly "
D,Task,"and also for different families comm like like family use as well comm "
D,Task,"so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it comm I think . "
D,Task,"Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something . "
A,Elicit,"So comm what are you saying comm maybe we should market it in different colours for different "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so we could do like the pink range comm the blue range comm the green range comm the "
B,Task,"That's yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So like you walk in comm you're like comm oh I like that remote control comm because it's so bright comm and then comm and then the shop assistant comes up and says comm oh what colour would you like ? "
D,Task,"and then they go like comm oh I can choose the colour wow . "
D,Task,"So it puts comm I think comm even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of comm you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . "
D,Task,"So they also get to pick . "
D,Task,"Well comm personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour . "
C,Task,"Yeah I mean comm that that seems to work well with for products like iPod comm "
D,Minor,"It's um "
C,Task,"where comm you know comm you have a variety of colours comm that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it comm even comm you know comm just just by the fact of choosing . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"D you've got the "
B,Minor,"Although I'd be curious to see how many uh "
B,Task,"You know comm there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose comm and I would be curious how many people choose that colour . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And produce less of the silly colours comm maybe . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Alright . Well um comm we'll alright let's "
A,Task,"what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um "
A,Minor,"is "

C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons comm "
A,Task,"we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things comm so we've we're keeping the costs down . "
A,Task,"It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky . "
A,Task,"Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"People comm you know comm people are saying comm oh comm standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury comm well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it . Um . "
A,Minor,"you know comm we're gonna we "
A,Task,"we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it comm "

A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean comm if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page comm it's not obvious . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"R_R_ . "
C,Task,"Well it is to us comm because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine comm "
C,Task,"but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
