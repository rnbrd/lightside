A,Elicit,"If you're all ready . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So is the agenda ? "
A,Task,"Opening comm acquaintance comm tool training and project plan comm discussion and then closing . "
A,Task,"Project aim is a new remote control . "
A,Task,"It's original comm uh trendy and it's user-friendly . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Project method comm functional design comm individual work comm another meeting comm "
A,Task,"conceptual design comm individual work comm and a meeting of details design comm "
A,Task,"individual work and a meeting . "
A,Task,"Tool training . "
A,Task,"Try out the whiteboard comm "
A,Task,"every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Uh Miss Industrial Designer comm would you like to go first ? "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"So are we supposed to bring the little things for the "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"why don't you just c comm I think just clip on clip "
A,Elicit,"do you have a belt ? "
D,Task,"Clip . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "

C,Task,"and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal . "
C,Task,"But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it . "
A,Task,"Okay comm well done . "
D,Task,"Great . "
D,Other,"Me ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . Miss mar Miss Marketing ? "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Not quite sure how this is gonna work . "
C,Other,"There go . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Other,"well I'll try my best to draw . "
D,Elicit,"Can I just draw the face ? "
A,Task,"Um yeah comm I think you can just draw the face comm "
A,Task,"but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks . "
D,Other,"Ooh . "
D,Task,"It's a cat . "
A,Task,"That's a very pr pretty cat . "
D,Task,"Which also has what ? A big fat body and "
D,Task,"big and a long tail . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"do y do you wanna do some write "
A,Task,"you wanna just write some words about it ? "
D,Other,"Why ? "
D,Task,"Because um cuddly . "
D,Task,"And usually cats are very friendly . "
D,Task,"Usually . "
D,Task,"And they're healing as well . "
D,Task,"They heal . "
D,Task,"And they can feel when a human's got problems so "

A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Um comm I don't actually have a favourite animal comm "
A,Other,"but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"I honestly can't draw for toffee . Uh . "
B,Elicit,"Really ? "
B,Minor,"Oh that's a "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"no "
C,Elicit,"A prairie dog ? "
A,Task,"no "
A,Minor,"uh "
C,Elicit,"Oh a squirrel ? "
A,Task,"That's exactly what it is . "
A,Task,"Uh not a very good one "
B,Task,"Not bad I would say . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's pretty good . "
A,Task,"Okay comm well comm you got it's a s It's a squirrel comm "
A,Task,"and I like them comm because they're cute and stupid . "
B,Task,"Very good . "
D,Other,"Ah . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"Right . Okay comm "
A,Task,"so comm I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . "
A,Task,"Mm . Let's move on to the next page . "
A,Task,"Okay comm project finance comm "
A,Task,"selling price twenty five Euros comm "
A,Task,"profit aim fifty million Euros . "
D,Task,"Market range internationally sold . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Production cost comm "
A,Other,"ah right "
A,Task,"it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . "
D,Task,"Ah right okay . "
A,Task,"experience with with remote control comm "
A,Task,"so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ? "
A,Task,"Stuff like that . "
A,Task,"Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . "
A,Task,"At quarter to twelve . "
C,Minor,"So I think before we close uh comm we are expected "
C,Task,"I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . "
C,Task,"I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . Uh "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"S "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think we're I mean before we close the meeting comm we're supposed to come up with some ideas for "
A,Elicit,"Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"oh okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next comm but "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think this is just the preliminary comm "
C,Task,"get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been "
C,Task,"and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Right comm who's got experiences with remote controls then ? "
A,Task,"Pretty much everybody . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think we've all got "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Elicit,"Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"'Kay um . "
D,Minor,"Well . "
B,Minor,"T "
D,Task,"A new remote control for T_V_ . "
D,Other,"What would I like ? Um . "
A,Minor,"W what "
A,Elicit,"You want it big do you want it small . "
D,Task,"Medium . "
A,Elicit,"Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas comm "
C,Task,"I mean comm you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ "
C,Task,"and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player comm or something like that comm "
A,Task,"Video and ts hi-fi and stuff . "
C,Task,"but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . "
A,Minor,"Maybe you "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"yeah "
A,Task,"now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . "
B,Minor,"But how do we know how much uh comm "
B,Elicit,"I mean comm how much do we have per how much ? "
D,Task,"Twelve fifty . "
B,Other,"Twelve fifty . "
C,Task,"It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit . "
D,Task,"Each . "
A,Task,"Per unit comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Cost . "
B,Elicit,"So do we have to be realistic within the budget or "
A,Minor,"Well at the moment we could comm wa I mean we "
B,Task,"Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Guess "
A,Task,"'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like comm "
A,Task,"and then after we after we've found out what we can like comm some different ideas comm we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? "
D,Task,"Like so you have one in like mm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"it doesn't have to be really thick . "
D,Task,"I mean remote controls can be thin bits . "
D,Task,"And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out comm "
D,Task,"and then you have another one comm you slide it out . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"have slides . "
D,Task,"And then it all comes compact "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"that's . "
D,Task,"into one . "
D,Minor,"So it's not "
D,Task,"you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner comm and um into one basically . "
A,Task,"Th that's an idea . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So you just flip them out . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff comm "
B,Task,"and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel comm program plus and minus comm and the just the mute button comm for example . "
B,Task,"I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . "
A,Task,"One side for kids comm one side for adults . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I'm not sure if that's like "
B,Task,"Or grandma as well comm you know it's like what is the mute button . "
C,Task,"I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though comm "
C,Task,"'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . "
B,Task,"No comm but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold "
B,Task,"like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons comm but "
C,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Oh okay . "
A,Minor,"Like it "
A,Task,"or something like a flip telephone comm something like that maybe . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"That would be cool . "
D,Task,"I was thinking that like a flip . "
A,Task,"F flip it open and you've got all the buttons comm or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um comm oh we've got five minutes left . "
B,Task,"Start breaking up . "
D,Task,"Okay . Um . "
A,Task,"But okay . "
A,Task,"Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"we should uh "
D,Minor,". "
C,Task,"I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception "
C,Task,"you know stage one was technical functions design comm "
C,Task,"what effect the apparatus should have . "
C,Task,"Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface comm "
C,Task,"but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ comm "
C,Task,"but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ comm I mean comm be able to operate "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"D_V_D_ players comm things like that . "
A,Minor,"I have got "
A,Task,"I think we should also have a back-up plan of I "
A,Task,"'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that "
A,Task,"I mean we don't comm we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control comm that just that is just for a T_V_ comm but it's just a really good comm nice one . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"What do you reckon ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I mean . "
A,Task,"See 'cause comm I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's true comm "
C,Task,"maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote comm "
C,Minor,"and have it be um "
A,Task,"I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . "
C,Task,"have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"uh simple to use comm and looks decent and "
A,Minor,"May w you know comm maybe even "
D,Elicit,"But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? "
A,Task,"Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people "
D,Minor,"I mean if it's if it's just like "
A,Task,"or so people that uh b don't see very well "
A,Task,"or big buttons for touchy buttons for "
C,Task,"Sorta find a niche for our remote comm like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"certain certain demographic "
A,Task,"Or just one that looks really fucking cool . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm no I think you're right . "
B,Task,"Could be really light or comm I dunno comm something special . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"rathe rather than focus on "
A,Task,"Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should "
C,Minor,"Y "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote comm doesn't say com combination with all all the r "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I mean obviously everyone "
A,Task,"we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads "
A,Task,"and we like things that do everything at once comm but you know comm that's "
C,Task,"Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . Yeah . "
A,Other,"I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well comm but that's not gonna happen . "
D,Task,"I think a flip up thing comm "
D,Task,"'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this "
D,Task,"well I did anyway comm "
D,Task,"like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach comm "
D,Task,"and you'd come and sit down and ooh comm the telephone's the television switched on or something . "
D,Task,"So maybe something that like "
D,Task,"does have a lid or closes comm "
D,Task,"so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it . "
D,Minor,"So make it "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's gotta be sellable . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's true what you were saying comm "
C,Task,"I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function comm it can just have a lock function comm "
C,Task,"so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And even for kids as well . "
D,Task,"It's um it's safer for them comm I guess . "
D,Task,"Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . "
A,Task,"No porn channel for children . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um alright comm "
A,Task,"so we've got some ideas comm "
A,Minor,"we've got um "
C,Task,"I guess that's good good for now . "
A,Task,"Let's move on . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"Oops comm let's close that . "
A,Other,"Next meeting comm uh okay . "
D,Elicit,"W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ? "
A,Task,"Industrial Designer "
D,Task,"Ah ri okay . "
A,Minor,"um which is "
D,Task,"these are requirement specification . "
B,Minor,"That's "
A,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"And I'm marketing . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"there you go . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"User Interface Designer comm that's that's "
C,Task,"That's me . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"that's you comm "
A,Task,"so you gotta you go comm you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um . "
C,Task,"Right . Right . "
A,Task,"Industrial Designer comm you are the one comm you know comm you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in comm I guess so comm um "
A,Task,"whether it's what goes into the box comm somehow . "
B,Task,"Mm . Har how it works an "
A,Task,"And in marketing "
D,Task,"These are requirement specification . "
B,Minor,"Bu "
A,Task,"User requirements specifications . "
D,Task,"So what the user requires "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"Do you think our two kind of overlap comm because "
D,Task,"in a remote . "
A,Minor,"what "
A,Task,"Right comm okay comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . "
D,Task,"I guess that's what it says . "
A,Task,"You two you two are gonna be just comm I think comm you just double up comm you know comm you working together . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research comm "
A,Task,"see what people want in a remote comm what buttons are used more often comm and s stuff like that . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Oh comm we've been warned to finish the meeting now . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay everyone comm well done . "
A,Task,"Good meeting . "
C,Task,"Alright comm "
C,Task,"see you in thirty minutes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So comm do we take these off ? "
B,Minor,"I don't "
