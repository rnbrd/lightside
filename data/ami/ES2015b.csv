B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . That's okay . That's okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Am I starting now ? "
A,Elicit,"Anytime ? "
A,Other,"Oh sorry . "
A,Minor,"'Kay comm um . Alright comm "
A,Other,"welcome back fro to the second meeting . "
A,Task,"And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . "
A,Minor,"Um comm and um comm "
A,Other,"I'll be taking minutes on this one comm "
A,Task,"and um Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself comm "
A,Task,"because it'll be more about uh comm what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . "
A,Minor,"Um comm so comm "
A,Task,"the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation . "
A,Minor,"And comm um "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Other,"sorry ? "
A,Minor,"So comm um comm "
A,Task,"take it away Poppy . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Um comm do I need to "
A,Task,"It's comm it's plugged in . "
A,Minor,"So comm um "
B,Other,"plugged in . "
C,Task,"F_ eight comm w . Function F_ eight . "
B,Other,"F_ okay . Function F_ eight . "
B,Other,"Sorry about this guys . "
A,Task,"No problem . "
B,Task,"'Kay . "
B,Other,"is on . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"I will take this time just to apologise . "
B,Task,"I comm I only comm uh comm received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing comm "
B,Task,"which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . "
B,Task,"But there we go . "
A,Task,"I'm sure it's fine . "
B,Task,"Um comm so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design comm "
B,Task,"and what we actually need to do comm "
B,Task,"and what the remote control needs to do . "
B,Task,"And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device comm so they can control the television from wherever they are . "
B,Task,"They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . "
B,Task,"So comm it gives them much more flexibility comm and allows them to be where they want to be . "
B,Minor,"Um comm from "
B,Task,"Uh comm on a functional side of things comm we found out that wh from our previous meeting comm we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . "
B,Task,"Um comm one is the visibility in the dark comm "
B,Task,"which was um Genevieve's idea . "
B,Task,"So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . "
B,Task,"And we could use illuminated buttons comm "
B,Task,"which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone comm or um something fam familiar . "
B,Task,"A automatically comm um lights up at first touch . "
B,Task,"Or we could use fluorescent materials "
B,Task,"which would just um take in the light during the day comm and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . "
B,Task,"Um comm also we could use um an alarm . "
B,Task,"So if we lost the um remote control comm perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself comm which you could press comm "
B,Task,"and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was comm hopefully in the room . "
B,Task,"Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . "
B,Task,"Um comm so that would work . "
B,Minor,"Um comm "
B,Other,"oop . "
B,Other,"Go back there . "
B,Task,"Um comm another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . "
B,Task,"Um comm from previous researches I've carried out on other projects comm um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . "
B,Task,"So they can be heated and um and cooled comm and they change the shape of um the metal . "
B,Task,"So comm for example comm a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . "
B,Task,"So um comm the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life comm if it was heated comm um everything would spring apart . "
B,Task,"So comm all the um individual components could be easily separated comm and then some could be reused comm some could be recycled comm "
B,Task,"and I think that would be very important for products now . "
B,Task,"Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . "
B,Minor,"'Cause all comm "
B,Task,"we all know that our resources are being limited comm "
B,Task,"and we have to be very environmentally conscious . "
A,Task,"Right comm um comm "
A,Task,"one question . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"This comm um comm self-destructible uh metal comm it allows for recycling materials ? "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"So that comm um comm someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it comm and then once they contribute it comm then that company can break down the part comm the parts better ? "
B,Minor,"And then "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"they would comm "
B,Task,"um you would make the comm the product as you normally would comm "
B,Task,"apart from the comm the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . "
B,Task,"And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . "
B,Task,"I mean comm the user would return the p product to the company comm "
B,Task,"'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . "
B,Task,"Um comm and then the company could then just use comm make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and then either reuse some bits comm "
B,Task,"and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time comm or not usable comm they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . "
B,Task,"Something like the case comm if it's scratched or something comm you would want to reuse it comm but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Would we be the company that would break down these comm or uh metals ? "
A,Elicit,"Or would we contribute to another group ? "
B,Minor,"You could "
B,Task,"we could probably empl em employ a comm a side company or something to do that for us . "
B,Task,"But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . "
B,Task,"For a certain percentage at least . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
B,Task,"Not every comm not a hundred percent of everything we produce comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"This sounds like a really great idea . "
A,Task,"One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um comm so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us comm cost the company comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . "
A,Task,"You would have to hire a number of people comm and it might be more expensive . "
B,Minor,"Well I "
B,Task,"the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they comm they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed . "
B,Task,"Like comm you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . "
B,Task,"Because of this comm their properties are smart material . "
B,Task,"All you need is just the heat comm so they self-destruct themselves . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
B,Task,"So I suppose it does need like high contact comm yeah comm you know high uh quality machinery comm and very specific machinery comm "
A,Task,"We'll still have to investigate the financial implications . "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"I like the environmental approach . "
A,Task,"Um comm we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Um also there is um components . "
B,Task,"This'll be how it uh will actually work . "
B,Task,"But I haven't put this plan together yet . "
A,Other,"I'm sorry comm "
B,Other,"There we go "
A,Task,"could you "
B,Other,". Sorry comm "
B,Elicit,"should I go back . "
A,Elicit,"Those were um "
B,Task,"This would actually show the circuit diagram . "
B,Task,"Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So I just put all those components in . "
A,Elicit,"So those are what comm um comm we'll c construct the remote . "
A,Minor,"Those are all the "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I it just shows what sort of energy source . "
B,Task,"It could be a battery comm "
B,Task,"like rechargeable probably . "
B,Minor,"Um comm an' yeah comm well "
B,Task,"how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . "
A,Task,"Alright . Great . "
B,Elicit,"Okay ? "
B,Elicit,"So comm now is it F_ eight again to escape ? "
B,Elicit,"Or escape ? "
B,Other,"There we go . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Thank you very much . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Task,"And comm um comm the next presenter will be Tara . "
B,Other,"There you go Tara . "
C,Other,"Thanks . "
C,Elicit,"Can you see ? "
D,Other,"Oh comm "
C,Minor,"Do you think "
C,Elicit,"Is it uh comm function eight yeah ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Function F_ eight . "
D,Task,"Function F_ eight . "
A,Task,"Function F_ eight . "
A,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Task,"The one at the top . "
C,Other,"Oh right . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"That looks right . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I'm the User um User Interface Designer . "
C,Task,"Uh comm the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . "
C,Task,"Um comm in this case it's the function of the remote control comm which is to send messages to the television comm television set . "
C,Task,"By taking inspiration from other similar designs comm we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control comm which is sellable international . "
C,Task,"There're two functional design options . "
C,Task,"A multifunctional remote control comm which can be used for several entertainment devices . "
C,Task,"And a single function remote control comm used specifically for the television . "
D,Other,"I'm sorry comm "
D,Other,"what was that last one . Multifunctional and "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Task,"Um comm a single function just for the television itself . "
D,Other,"Ch Oh comm I see . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Um comm multifunctional controls can be difficult to use comm as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . "
C,Task,"A single function remote control is simpler to use comm but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"Um comm I think that a single function remote control would be preferable comm "
C,Task,"because it's easier to use . "
C,Task,"It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets comm making it more internationally sellable . "
C,Minor,"Um comm it will make an original design more obtainable comm as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . "
C,Task,"And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . "
C,Task,"And less functions would have to be included . "
C,Task,"So it would be cheaper to make . "
C,Task,"And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . "
C,Elicit,"Does anyone have any questions ? "
D,Elicit,"So as far as we know comm um comm a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? "
C,Task,"Well comm it's just that comm when we're creating it comm we're comm we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent comm "
D,Other,"D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ? "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"other entertainment devices . "
A,Elicit,"Does everyone agree with this ? "
A,Elicit,"Does anyone object and comm and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ? "
B,Task,"Um comm I was just wondering about the comm what comm what Genevieve said before comm about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . "
B,Task,"And that would probably comm um comm I d comm well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . "
B,Task,"I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And limit the design . "
B,Elicit,"Do you think ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I think I agree with the single design thing for now comm "
D,Task,"because we're trying to do so much comm that if we're trying to make a unique comm user-friendly comm dadada comm and it's also multi also multifunctional comm um comm we're gonna go over budget for one thing . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . That's true . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"We'll have more money to go into the design side of it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Alright . Sounds great . "
D,Minor,"Mm comm 'kay . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm well comm um comm "
A,Elicit,"are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ? "
D,Task,"Yes I am . "
A,Task,"Fabulous . "
A,Task,"Except you're not hooked up to the "
D,Other,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"I'm not hooked up comm "
D,Task,"but other than that comm completely ready . "
A,Task,"Great . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"I just lost my microphone . "
A,Task,"No problem comm "
D,Other,"Just a moment . "
A,Minor,"we can "
D,Other,"Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . "
D,Other,"Um comm and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . "
D,Task,"Um comm if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting comm with the coffee machine ? "
D,Task,"The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . "
D,Task,"Um comm so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . "
D,Task,"Um comm so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . "
D,Task,"Um comm I've done some marketing research comm a lot of interviews with remote control users comm um comm and some internet research . "
D,Other,"And I'll show you my findings . "
D,Other,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . "
D,Task,"So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . "
D,Task,"Um comm hence our motto comm we put the fashion in electronics . "
D,Task,"So I think that should be our priority here . "
D,Task,"Um comm and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . "
D,Task,"So that it's something that fits in the household . "
A,Other,"I'm sorry comm "
A,Other,"what was that last thing that you just said ? "
D,Task,"Um comm we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Any trends that are going on in comm in the public comm even media comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"you know who's famous comm what T_V_ shows are being watched comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"um comm to influence our remote control . "
D,Task,"Okay comm so the findings . "
D,Task,"Um comm seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . "
D,Task,"Which is a comm quite a significant number . "
D,Task,"Um comm the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them comm you know comm neutral . "
D,Task,"Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . "
D,Task,"Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . "
A,Other,"I'm sorry comm "
A,Other,"that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . "
A,Elicit,"You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm they're willing comm they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . "
D,Task,"As opposed to your basic comm you know comm oval black comm all same size button remote control . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um comm so it is something that people care about . It's not comm it's not ignored in the household . "
D,Task,"Um comm seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . "
D,Task,"Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . "
D,Task,"They're you know thumb-masters . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um comm and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . "
D,Task,"That A very small amount . "
D,Task,"Thought that was interesting . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm "
A,Task,"so it might be very appealing if comm um comm we have very concise buttons . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"the single function . "
A,Task,"And another thing with um lots of surfing comm we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"because I find with um channel-changers that comm um comm a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah that's a good point . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"And actually to go with that comm I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons comm how much they're used . "
D,Task,"And uh how important the uh users find them . "
D,Task,"So the power button comm obviously comm in an hour is only used once . "
D,Task,"Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . "
D,Task,"Um comm but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . "
D,Task,"So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . "
D,Task,"Um comm as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . "
D,Task,"Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . "
D,Task,"That's a huge amount . "
D,Task,"This is the most important button . "
D,Task,"Um comm so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it comm "
D,Task,"so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . "
D,Task,"Relevance of that button comm our users found was uh ten comm ten out of ten . "
D,Task,"Uh comm ditto for volume selection comm so ten out of ten . "
D,Task,"And it's used on average four times an hour . "
D,Task,"Not as much as channel selection comm but still significant . "
D,Task,"Um comm audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . "
D,Task,"Relevance is two . "
D,Task,"Screen settings comm which means brightness comm colour etcetera comm zero point five times an hour . "
D,Task,"Um comm and relevance of one point five . "
D,Task,"We're getting to specific statistics here . "
D,Task,"Teletext comm um comm now I'm not too clear on what that is . "
D,Elicit,"I don't know if you can help me . "
D,Task,"Flipping pages . "
D,Minor,"Is that "
C,Minor,"It's um "
B,Task,"It's like the news . "
B,Task,"Or like information . "
C,Minor,"It has "
C,Task,"T_V_ has like information comm it has information on holidays comm the news comm entertainment . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"The "
B,Task,"and what's on . "
D,Elicit,"So like a running banner comm underneath "
A,Minor,"It's um "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"it's a button that you press comm and then you comm uh comm like a menu pops up . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"li Yeah . "
C,Unlab,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I haven't used it before "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"It's like "
C,Task,"And you have page numbers like for the menu comm "
C,Task,"and you press the page numbers with your remote comm and it comm it'll come up . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"It's like very basic internet . Sort of comm "
C,Task,"Very basic internet comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"um "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"But you have "
D,Elicit,"Like tells you the weather comm and "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But you have no interaction back with it comm you know . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Like the internet you can send emails and You've no interaction . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"it's just information that um comm like television timetables comm what's on comm what's on now comm what's on next comm on every channel comm and "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
D,Task,"Well I guess I'm not with it comm "
D,Minor,"because I wasn't "
D,Task,"But it's comm it's being used fourteen times an hour . "
D,Task,"Um comm and has a r a high relevance of six point five . "
D,Task,"So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um comm channel settings . Zero point zero one times an hour . Relevance of three . "
D,Other,"Channel settings . "
C,Task,"Uh comm probably just tuning in the channels comm "
C,Elicit,"would it be ? "
D,Other,"P Sorry . "
D,Other,"Changing the channels ? "
C,Task,"Tuning them in at the very start . "
C,Task,"You know if you get a new T_V_ set comm you tune in all the channels comm "
D,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
C,Elicit,"do you th do you think ? "
B,Task,"To get the right reception and picture comm I suppose . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Um comm so it's not used very often comm but people still find it relevant . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Um comm biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . "
D,Task,"Remote controls are often lost somewhere . "
D,Task,"So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a comm an alarm system so that people can find it . "
D,Task,"Um comm takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . "
D,Task,"So it should be very user-friendly comm you know . "
D,Task,"People know what to do very quickly . "
D,Other,"Um comm remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . "
B,Task,"Repetitive strain injury . "
C,Minor,"Repeti Uh . "
D,Other,"Ah . "
B,Task,"I think . "
D,Elicit,"Is that what it is ? "
D,Elicit,"People with arthritis and such ? "
A,Task,"That's rather sad . "
D,Task,"Um comm maybe our "
B,Task,"Oh comm I'm guessing that's what it is . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . I think it is . "
B,Minor,"I'm not "
D,Task,"designers can look into that . "
D,Task,"Um comm buttons that don't require comm you know comm very firm pushing comm if they respond . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But we'll have to also avoid comm you know comm buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . "
D,Task,"That's a problem . "
B,Task,"Yeah . It is . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Did you guys uh get that one down ? "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"Um okay comm "
D,Task,"here's some ideas for you . "
D,Task,"A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . "
D,Other,"So I'll show you some numbers here . "
D,Task,"Um comm so the youngest age group comm fifteen to twenty five . "
D,Task,"Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . "
D,Minor,"Um comm and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s "
D,Task,"Interestingly enough comm twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . Um comm that would comm are willing to pay extra . "
D,Task,"So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're comm we're targeting comm "
D,Task,"and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . "
D,Task,"And if we have the budget for it . "
D,Task,"Um comm if we are targeting young adults comm it looks like something that would pay off . "
D,Task,"Seeing as ninety percent comm over ninety percent would pay for it . "
A,Task,"I agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um comm financially and and functionally . "
A,Task,"Um comm and especially if we are um trying to be trendy comm go with fashions comm things like that . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Um comm ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned . "
D,Task,"So that comm that's a whole other field of research . "
D,Task,"I don't know if it'd be comm if we'd still have a remote comm or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . "
D,Task,"Um and depending on how many members you have in households . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So it m it may be too complicated for us comm but it's something to keep in mind anyway . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself . "
D,Task,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Wonder if it would have "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And if there was conversation in the room at the same time comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television comm "
B,Task,"but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"If we're looking for a simplistic design comm "
A,Minor,"if "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We need to decide if that is our um intention is comm is a simplistic design . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Um comm because if comm if it is then I think voice comm um voice-activated "
D,Minor,"It looks like "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing comm "
A,Task,"because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a comm they won't be talking into a remote comm I'm sure . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"It'd be like the ultimate remote . "
D,Minor,"Um okay . "
D,Task,"And th the last thing here was a comm an L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Task,"So comm I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . "
D,Task,"Not practical . "
D,Task,"Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that comm you know comm you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with . "
A,Other,"Um comm I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is . "
D,Other,"Oh sorry comm "
D,Task,"just comm just a screen comm like a computer screen . "
D,Task,"S Or like um "
C,Task,"Mobile phone . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Or Like an alarm clock . "
D,Task,"You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a comm a normal clock . "
B,Elicit,"What comm what would appear on the screen ? "
A,Other,"I have no idea still . "
A,Other,"I'm sorry . "
D,Task,"Oh just like an electronic screen . "
D,Task,"As opposed to just buttons . There would be like a little comm like on "
A,Other,"Oh comm on the remote . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Like on the top of a cellphone comm the the little L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um comm now that's comm I comm "
D,Task,"I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . "
D,Task,"I guess the channel that you're on comm the v the volume setting . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Could it it "
C,Task,"It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on comm and what was next . "
C,Minor,"But that would probably be "
B,Task,"Like linked in with the teletext comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . That would be good comm yeah . "
B,Task,"or sort of like an "
B,Task,"teletext at your fingers comm without having to access that through the television . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Might be quite expensive to do that though . "
B,Task,"Mm comm Yeah . "
B,Task,"Could be . "
D,Task,"Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research . "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Um comm and finally comm whoops comm my personal preferences and thoughts . "
D,Task,"Um comm I think our priority really should be unique design . "
D,Task,"Um comm we want something that people want in their home . "
D,Task,"Every remote control looks the same comm "
D,Task,"so uh in my opinion it should be comm um comm user-friendly and unique . "
D,Task,"So the other stuff might be a little too comm a little too gadgety for some people . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um comm I th myself comm voice recognition kind of scares me off . "
D,Task,"So if we're comm if we're aiming to make this an international university comm universally accepted product "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Um comm and for all comm "
D,Task,"the other thing is like age market . "
D,Task,"I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds comm we could go for the fancy stuff . "
D,Task,"But if we wanna make fifty million comm and and have everyone want this remote control comm we should maybe "
D,Task,"stick to the basics . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control comm when they're just starting out "
C,Task,"and comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Right . "
D,Task,"And we have to keep in mind the comm the reliability of our research . "
D,Task,"I mean comm you know comm a sixteen year old boy would say comm yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition comm until they realise that's three months allowance . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um comm so I I think comm I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Early twenties comm that's the kind of age group . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And if one of the largest comm uh comm or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control comm "
C,Task,"Twenties . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"That's it for the market research . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like comm I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . "
A,Task,"Um comm for one thing comm because Having controls with D_V_D_ comm V_C_R_ comm that sort of thing comm would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um comm we've decided not to include them and make it a specific comm just a specific television um function . "
A,Task,"Which is good as comm as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . "
A,Task,"Um comm for many reasons . "
A,Task,"So um we have that decision sort of made for us . "
A,Task,"Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated comm because more people are using the internet now . "
A,Task,"And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . "
B,Other,"Can I just interrupt ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Would you like to plug in your "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Maybe we can do the "
B,Elicit,"Have you got a PowerPoint or not ? "
A,Task,"Okay comm sure . "
A,Task,"Yeah I do . "
A,Task,"I'm looking at looking at it right now . "
B,Task,"Okay . Thanks . "
D,Other,"There you go . "
A,Other,"thank you . "
D,Other,"Oh comm come back screen . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Were they comm was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext comm or just avoiding both altogether ? "
A,Minor,"Um comm well comm "
A,Task,"I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Alright comm and another thing . "
A,Task,"This is for the design comm the design of the product is that um we wanna create comm um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . "
A,Task,"So comm um comm all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So comm um comm perhaps um our logo on the bottom comm or wherever you feel like it would look good . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um comm it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company "
B,Minor,"Just "
A,Task,"but comm another thing is that comm um "
A,Task,"we need to comm we probably would have to have that colour and comm and logo decided upon . "
A,Task,"Um comm I'm assuming that we already have one comm "
A,Task,"but for the purposes of this meeting I comm I wasn't offered a comm like a type of logo or colour comm "
A,Task,"so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Work on that . "
D,Task,"It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"The little R_ R_ yellow thing ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Real Reaction ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um comm yes comm those are the changes . "
A,Task,"Um comm so comm now we need to discuss comm um and come to a decision on our remote control functions comm of comm of how this is going to be . "
A,Other,"I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . "
A,Task,"Um comm we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . "
A,Task,"So comm um comm we already know that it'll just be for the television . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"It'll It won't have teletext . "
A,Task,"But um comm you know comm we could discuss um those other options that you brought up comm Genevieve . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so I "
D,Elicit,"Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Is that how most people feel about that ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So no L_C_D_ comm no teletext comm and no voice recognition . "
C,Minor,"I think it would be annoying though if "
C,Task,"I don't use teletext that much comm but if it was on your T_V_ comm you'd want to be able to use it comm "
C,Minor,"if "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd comm um comm I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext comm so it'd be really superfluous . "
C,Minor,"You'd Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So is it just "
D,Task,"Never heard of it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,". I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ . "
A,Elicit,"Do you know if anywhere else has it ? "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"More research required comm I think . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
B,Minor,"But if "
B,Elicit,"Was it a management decision that we're having "
A,Task,"It was a management decision comm "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"so it's comm it's pretty much out of our hands at this point . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay then . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"So comm I guess we're looking at something rather simple . "
D,Task,"Um comm well I guess comm just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons . "
B,Task,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
B,Other,"Minimal "
D,Minor,"And the "
D,Elicit,"What was the word they used ? "
D,Task,"F findability is important . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . "
B,Minor,"Yeah okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared "
B,Task,"Yeah . The same signalling . "
A,Task,"the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . "
B,Minor,"I mean "
A,Task,"It's not that expensive to do . "
B,Task,"Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . "
B,Task,"Like you just a comm a buzz or something . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Okay . I like that idea . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Would you be able to comm um comm put the little device anywhere ? "
C,Elicit,"'Cause uh isn't our remote control for all T_V_s comm "
C,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"If "
C,Minor,"you'd ha "
B,Elicit,"Do you mean the the link between the "
C,Task,"Yeah comm with the button that you pressed . "
B,Task,"Well comm if the button was actually on "
A,Task,"Yeah . The button "
A,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Oh comm yeah . "
C,Task,"C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set comm "
A,Task,"Minor detail there . "
C,Task,"so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere comm or something . "
B,Minor,"Maybe "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm it would have t "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Obviously something small that's "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's a good point . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Then it wouldn't comm it probably wouldn't be able to use "
A,Task,"It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess comm but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Elicit,"Would it need a battery then ? "
A,Minor,"Maybe comm um "
B,Task,"Pr probably . "
A,Task,"Probably comm "
A,Minor,"I mean . "
B,Minor,"Unless it could be "
A,Task,"That's your department "
A,Task,"you'll have to sort that out . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Um comm unless some way comm it could have some universal connection to like the socket comm the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . "
B,Task,"I mean the power for the T_V_ . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"So comm mm comm more research into that one . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm you'll have to "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"you'll have to investi Do some research on that comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"alright ? "
A,Task,"Great . "
A,Minor,"Um comm alright comm "
A,Task,"and I'm sure that comm um "
A,Task,"um comm the glow-in-the-dark comm fluorescent comm whatever comm system comm um is a go ahead . "
A,Elicit,"Is everyone interested in that ? "
B,Minor,"Y "
D,Other,"On the buttons ? "
C,Task,"I I like the light up suggestion . "
C,Task,"I think that would be better . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time comm so "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I would go for "
D,Minor,"it doesn't "
D,Task,"It could it could be a tactile thing as well . "
D,Task,"Um right comm if w if we're minimising buttons comm we might be able to make them actually larger . "
D,Task,"And there's something on it . "
D,Task,"S you know like up arrow down arrow for comm for volume . "
B,Task,"Like a raised "
D,Task,"Um comm and I don't know what we could do for comm for channels . S "
C,Task,"Well just the numbers could be embossed comm "
C,Elicit,"couldn't it ? "
C,Task,"Like raised . "
D,Task,"The numbers themselves . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Could be raised . "
D,Elicit,"But then the like up button and down button for the channel comm channel changing . "
C,Task,"Just little arrows comm that you could feel comm maybe ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"I just thought that it comm it might be sucking more battery power comm if there comm if it is a light up . "
D,Task,"I'm not sure . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's true . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And also y comm uh Heather you mentioned before comm um like how it should be accessible to everybody . "
A,Minor,"But I mean "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm so like big b um buttons comm for people you are visually impaired . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So like you say tactile might be better comm because it'd be more available to everybody . "
C,Task,"That comm I think that's good comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Could we somehow "
A,Task,"We could comm may comm possibly comm sorry comm incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material comm um comm like the actual soft plastic comm um comm costs that much more than other colours . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"No comm I wouldn't say so . "
B,Task,"No comm it's not these days . "
B,Task,"I mean comm it's quite easily accessible . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I guess the other option comm referring to the battery thing is comm you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something comm when you're s and then it goes comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's good Yeah that a good idea . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so if comm if you're like changing the volume during a movie . "
D,Task,"I know comm I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And you don't want to turn on the lights comm to turn it down comm because there's suddenly an explosion comm and it's gonna wake up the baby . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um comm so if you touch the button comm it kind of reactivates it . "
D,Task,"It lights up for "
C,Task,"That comm yeah comm that's a good idea . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"On self timer . "
B,Other,"So self-timed lighting . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Alright we have five minutes left "
B,Minor,"Um comm I "
A,Task,"um comm for the meeting comm "
A,Task,"but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . "
A,Minor,"Um comm what was "
A,Task,"I missed the last moment comm reading that . "
A,Elicit,"What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ? "
D,Task,"Oh comm just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten comm fifteen seconds when you touch a button comm after having not touched it for a while . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um comm if instead of a constant light up on the comm on the remote control comm if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again . "
A,Elicit,"Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and you comm you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit comm and it gives a faint glow . "
B,Task,"So comm self-timed "
D,Task,"So if you have all the lights off in your living room comm you'll comm you'll temporarily see it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's probably feasible . "
A,Elicit,"So comm do you think that we should do the lighting up thing comm and the glow-in-the-dark thing comm and the shape of the numbers ? "
A,Task,"Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . "
C,Task,"Yeah . For visually impaired comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"And I think that's un unique as well . "
B,Task,"I mean comm I haven't seen that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on comm you know printed . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"And it could comm if it's that softer rubber material it'll be comm maybe comm um comm uh comm better for people with um els no "
B,Task,"durable . "
A,Elicit,"what's it called comm R_S_I_ comm "
A,Elicit,"what was it that we were talking about ? "
B,Task,"Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Oh right comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"the "
B,Task,"Repetitive strain injury . "
A,Task,"Yeah instead of like hard buttons . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Um comm did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? "
A,Elicit,"Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? "
C,Minor,"If "
A,Elicit,"Like should we do both ? "
A,Elicit,"Or we can have one or the other ? "
A,Task,"Because it might comm for comm for our design purposes comm I mean comm the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"I was gonna say comm "
A,Task,"And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with . "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"It the "
D,Task,"it might be perceived as tacky comm glow-in-the-dark . "
D,Task,"It's kind of like Eighties neon-style . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"Um comm whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . "
B,Minor,"and we could "
B,Task,"Yeah there are now like loads comm or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well comm "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"which could like link in with the company colours . "
B,Task,"Like it could be blue or green or yellow comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"or like we've just limited t with the comm just ordinary phosphorescent so "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"So we've decided on lighting up things . "
C,Task,"I was thinking though comm if it was glow-in-the-dark comm you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark comm and then it would be constantly advertised . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Every time the comm that it lit up comm you c that could light up as well . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Or comm or the comm whate "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But with the same thing comm "
A,Task,"I mean . If you touch the button and then it could be comm it could be lit up as well . "
D,Task,"That's true . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Is "
A,Elicit,"Are you okay with that ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . Cool . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"So I think that um "
B,Minor,"Is "
A,Task,"that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions . "
A,Task,"And now it's up to designing . "
A,Task,"And um making sure that this can be feasible . "
D,Minor,"What um "
A,Minor,"And do you have anything "
D,Other,"Oh sorry . "
A,Elicit,"Do you have anything to say ? "
D,Task,"Yeah well comm I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . "
D,Task,"Um comm it comm you comm 'cause you mentioned face plates . "
D,Task,"So I I dunno if there's something that diff comm you know like five different face plates . "
D,Task,"I dunno if this will start making it more complicated comm "
D,Task,"but it could increase the popularity of the comm of the remote . Um "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Oh yeah . "
B,Task,"Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . "
C,Other,"Interchangeable thing ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"Like an iPod or something ? "
C,Task,"That would be good . "
D,Task,"Exactly comm like an iPod . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm or "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Or comm or like mobile ph . "
A,Other,"Like a cellphone ? Yeah . "
D,Task,"And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . "
D,Task,"Like a Bart Simpson faceplate . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Y Could buy extra "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Accessories . "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
D,Task,"You could start out with three comm and if comm if we hit it big then we can add some on . "
B,Minor,"Person "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Well comm that's great . "
C,Task,"That's a good idea . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think that we should incorporate that . "
B,Other,"Interchangeable . "
B,Minor,"Um comm als "
A,Task,"'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all . "
A,Task,"You'd just get one mould comm "
C,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Interchan "
A,Task,"throw some plastic in it comm you know . "
B,Minor,"And also possible "
B,Task,"I mean comm uh comm we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows comm or "
C,Task,"Oh yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well comm that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So comm if it takes off then we'll comm we'll comm we'll try that out . "
B,Minor,"But if we comm there is "
C,Minor,"If w "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"We could "
B,Task,"Um comm the environmental factor comm we didn't bring that up again . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"We'll have to do more research . "
A,Task,"Like as of yet comm that has nothing to do with comm um comm the way it'll look . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um comm does it need to be reached a de "
A,Elicit,"Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? "
B,Minor,"Um comm I've "
A,Task,"Because we need to investigate the financial implications . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Let's "
A,Minor,"Is it "
A,Elicit,"Does it need to be uh decided on now ? "
A,Minor,"Or should we "
B,Task,"I think we could probably leave that 'til later on comm then . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Good . "
A,Minor,"Alright then . "
A,Elicit,"Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ? "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm well . "
A,Task,"Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Alright ? "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
