C,Task,"Uh comm making a profit of fifty million Euros . "
A,Other,"Alright "
A,Task,"so twenty five . "
D,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Task,"So comm it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . "
A,Minor,"So yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I've "
A,Task,"The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television comm "
A,Task,"and they're fairly basic . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So uh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I was thinking that as well comm "
C,Task,"I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things "
D,Task,"Yeah the universal ones . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"where they're comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So presumably that might be an idea to put into . "
A,Task,"But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure . "
B,Other,"Slim . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Uh 'cause I mean comm what uh twenty five Euros comm that's about I dunno comm fifteen Pounds or so ? "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm comm it's about that . "
C,Task,"And that's quite a lot for a remote control . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Um well "
D,Task,"my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . "
D,Task,"As you said they come with the T_V_ "
D,Task,"so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions comm "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Elicit,"so maybe we could think about colour ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Make "
D,Task,"that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . "
D,Task,"Um comm and as you say comm we need to have some kind of gimmick comm "
D,Elicit,"so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"you know those things ? "
C,Task,"The the keyrings comm yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"Because we always lose our remote control . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Other,"that's cool . "
B,Minor,"Uh yeah uh comm "
B,Task,"being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product "
B,Task,"like what is the competition in the market ? "
B,Task,"What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? "
B,Task,"What speciality other remote controls are having "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . "
B,Task,"So before deciding or before finalising this project comm we must discuss all these things comm "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"like "
B,Task,"and apart from this comm it should be having a good look also comm "
B,Task,"because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player comm M_P_ three player like any electronic devices . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"They really want to have something good comm having a good design in their hands comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"so comm yes comm "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"all this . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm what do we think a "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Minor,"we're looking for "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"What do we think a good size would be for this ? "
C,Minor,"We're "
C,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Task,"'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky "
C,Task,"carry on . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and there's just like a hundred buttons on it comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . "
D,Task,"Then you lose it comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Kind of um comm maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of comm just hand held comm "
D,Minor,"like comm "
C,Minor,"For for uh "
D,Minor,"'cause "
C,Task,"remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"No comm I wasn't comm no "
D,Other,"sorry "
D,Task,"I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ "
C,Minor,"Okay well right "
D,Minor,"but "
C,Minor,"we'll have to um I'll "
C,Task,"we're k having another meeting in half an hour "
C,Minor,"so um "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"we should all look into a bit "
C,Task,"uh comm oh actually comm no comm "
C,Task,"we'll allocate . "
C,Task,"So you do the looking around at other remote controls . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Um comm if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever comm "
C,Task,"and you could look into um basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one comm how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . "
C,Task,"And obviously comm other instructions will come from the personal coach . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Which will probably just usurp what I said "
C,Minor,"so "
D,Elicit,"So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? "
C,Task,"Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive . "
D,Other,"Yep . Okay . "
