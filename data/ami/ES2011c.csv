A,Other,"Hi everyone comm hope you had a nice lunch . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Alright we're moving on to conceptual design . "
C,Other,"'Scuse me . "
D,Other,"Bless you . "
A,Other,"Um comm I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . "
A,Task,"Um comm under marketing we targeted our audience comm "
A,Minor,"and Um comm yeah . "
A,Task,"That was generally how helpful that was . "
A,Task,"Um comm then we considered some design options with how it should look comm "
A,Task,"um comm we discussed an iPod-like button system "
A,Task,"which comm uh comm we haven't concluded but we're "
A,Minor,"Right comm um "
A,Task,"So comm if you all have presentations to do comm we can see what where you've come from our last time . "
A,Elicit,"Does everyone have presentations ? "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"Would anybody like to go first ? "
B,Other,"Sure . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So I've been looking at the components design . "
B,Task,"Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet "
B,Task,"and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . "
B,Task,"Um comm so we need some custom design parts comm and other parts we'll just use standard . "
B,Task,"Um comm I assume we'll be custom designing our case comm "
B,Task,"probably a hard plastic or some other material case comm to protect the remote and the locator . "
B,Task,"And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board comm "
B,Task,"because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . "
B,Task,"But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . "
B,Task,"Um comm standard parts include the buttons and the wheels comm um the iPod-style wheel . "
B,Task,"The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . "
B,Task,"Um comm we need a radio sender and receiver comm those are standard . "
B,Task,"And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . "
B,Task,"So we have some material options . "
B,Task,"Um comm we can use rubber comm plastic comm wood or titanium . "
B,Task,"Um comm I'd recommend against titanium "
B,Task,"because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . "
B,Task,"Um comm and the rubber case requires rubber buttons comm so if we definitely want plastic buttons comm we shouldn't have a rubber case . "
A,Elicit,"And why not wood ? "
B,Minor,"And comm "
B,Other,"hmm ? "
A,Elicit,"And why not wood ? "
B,Task,"Uh comm well we can use wood . "
B,Task,"I don't know why we'd want to . "
B,Task,"Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button comm it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . "
B,Task,"We can't use the minimal chip comm we need the next higher grade comm which is called regular . "
B,Task,"I don't think it's much more expensive comm but it is more expensive . "
B,Task,"So that's what I've got on design . "
A,Task,"'S good . "
D,Other,"Um comm can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"which is quite shocking . "
D,Minor,"Ha . Mm . "
D,Task,"Right comm um comm I have been searching the current trends comm um comm both on the web and via fashion-watchers comm "
D,Task,"and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh comm fancy look and feel . "
D,Task,"Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . "
D,Task,"And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . "
D,Task,"Um comm fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing comm "
D,Task,"but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . "
D,Task,"Um comm our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided comm well noticed comm that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend "
D,Task,"and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want comm you know comm wh whatever our motto is . Um . "
D,Task,"For fashion comm we go for fashion . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"The fashion in electronics . "
D,Task,"So we want to put the fashion electronics comm we need to go fruit and vegetables . "
D,Task,"And also go for a spongy feel comm "
D,Task,"so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . "
D,Task,"As to the material should be limited to "
D,Task,"I don't know how spongy it can be comm "
D,Task,"should discuss this together comm "
D,Task,"I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . "
D,Task,"Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables comm "
D,Task,"but that's just a personal opinion . "
D,Minor,"I think "
D,Task,"I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room . "
D,Task,"Uh those are just suggestions "
D,Task,"and also we need to decide whether this should be printed comm "
D,Task,"so that still has to do with the material discuss "
D,Task,"should we print the fruit stuff comm or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? "
D,Task,"Um comm and finally again with the spongy . "
D,Task,"It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that "
D,Task,"or find come up with a solution that's better than mine . "
D,Task,"Um comm yeah comm to summarise these are the points that need to be um comm touched in order to get a good decision comm "
D,Task,"and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Thank you for your attention . "
C,Other,"So . "
A,Task,"I think it's the next it's the blue one comm yeah . "
C,Other,"Oh comm uh comm there we go . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Um . "
C,Other,"Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . "
C,Task,"I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics "
C,Minor,"and and uh "
D,Task,"Neither was I . "
D,Task,"Well it's a trend in fashion comm in clothing and um fabrics . "
A,Task,"Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . "
C,Task,"So so okay comm let me get this right . "
C,Task,"Okay comm uh "
C,Minor,"Okay comm alright anyway . "
C,Other,"Um here we go . "
C,Task,"Conceptual User Interface . "
C,Minor,"Trying "
C,Task,"we're gonna try to talk about comm um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control comm based on fruit vegetable design . "
C,Task,"And comm um comm basically comm so comm this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . "
C,Task,"Uh comm so people are going to be looking at this little screen . "
C,Minor,"Um comm kind of "
C,Elicit,"I mean I assume comm are we still on the screen idea ? "
A,Task,"Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time . "
C,Task,"'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um the wheel "
A,Task,"You need a screen for it ? "
C,Minor,"you "
C,Task,"it seems like you would need a screen . "
B,Task,"You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song comm "
B,Task,"like you know that band or whatever . "
C,Minor,"But like if you think about it "
B,Task,"With T_V_ channels it's comm you know comm one two three . So "
C,Minor,"yeah but if "
C,Minor,"so is it just okay . "
C,Elicit,"So comm b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that comm aren't you ? "
A,Task,"We're comm um comm we're actually not having D_V_D_ comm "
C,Minor,"Are we "
A,Minor,"that was one of th I I was "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"sorry comm "
A,Task,"I I meant to update you on that . Um . "
C,Task,"Alright . Okay . "
D,Task,"But the screen can come up on the telly comm the she said . "
C,Task,"Okay . Okay . "
D,Elicit,"That correct ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So anyway if "
C,Minor,"well we just "
C,Minor,"we need to "
C,Task,"Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think "
C,Minor,"I was thinking okay . "
C,Elicit,"So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? "
C,Minor,"And you're just gonna "
C,Task,"I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a "
D,Task,"Graphical interface ? "
C,Minor,"right . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"Uh on the "
C,Minor,"like you're g "
D,Task,"you can have it on the telly though . "
C,Task,"yeah "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can "
C,Task,"okay we're not choosing that comm I guess . "
C,Task,"But like choose channel control comm "
C,Minor,"like if you wa "
C,Task,"Because people aren't gonna be able to have like comm um comm you know comm channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So that "
C,Minor,"people seems to be well "
A,Minor,"You've "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I know what you're saying comm "
C,Other,"You know . "
A,Minor,"you have to "
C,Task,"But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . "
C,Minor,"So um "
C,Task,"I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen "
C,Minor,"because "
C,Task,"So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if "
C,Minor,"or or "
C,Minor,"then again if you just "
C,Minor,"I guess I c "
C,Task,"I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"But but imagine someone with s "
B,Task,"My flatmates actually had one with a wheel comm and it it did show up on the T_V_ . "
C,Task,"I oh yeah ? "
A,Elicit,"But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . "
A,Task,"Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to "
C,Minor,"'Cause you'll have to like "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"They have to r wheel really fast . "
C,Minor,"but you can quickly s you can "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"at least on theirs . "
C,Minor,"Yeah if you do comm it w so it would have to be you "
C,Task,"I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of comm you know comm range we need to have on the wheel comm "
C,Minor,"and um "
C,Task,"So you're either you're you know comm th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that comm you know comm you can like tap for comm um comm different "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"uh comm whatchamacallits comm different um comm you know comm functions like volume "
C,Task,"or comm like you can tap just to get to different channels . "
C,Task,"Like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"And then there's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television comm "
C,Task,"or if you want to um you know switch around comm I don't know comm like comm these different modes "
C,Task,"like turn on the timer or like something something like that comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"like "
A,Task,"I mean with that many options comm you'd uh I'd think that the screen would be better comm "
A,Task,"because you could have that menu option comm sort of "
C,Task,"I would think so too comm like "
C,Minor,"So I mean "
C,Minor,"and it seems it w "
C,Task,"it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it comm you know comm "
C,Minor,"because "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"but then again it would "
C,Minor,"it does make kind of "
C,Minor,"if the screen's sort of just like an option that comm like comm is just there and you're not really using it comm that's kind of "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's more expensive according to the design people . "
C,Task,"m yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's the only thing though . "
B,Task,"You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in comm "
B,Task,"which is more expensive than the regular chip comm which is more expensive than the minimal . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing comm um "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"You can get to you know comm you can "
C,Task,"Like maybe it'll be that central button "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"that comm like comm then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and you can just scroll around comm like comm to do the timer comm to do the "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So the T_V_ is the screen comm that "
C,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah "
A,Task,"So it would have all these different options of changing "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up . "
A,Minor,"to "
D,Task,"Look it even has settings . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Hmm ? "
D,Minor,"On the "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"you can just take theirs and just "
C,Task,"Yeah comm well we don't want the screen I guess comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"but um "
C,Minor,"'cause that just "
C,Task,"it does seem like comm it that would be comm like comm incredibly expensive comm "
C,Minor,"but I dunno comm "
C,Minor,"and then so comm "
C,Task,"it just im really all you need is comm like comm this little wheel then comm and you can control everything . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Um comm right . "
A,Minor,"What if "
A,Task,"I mean comm if you're thinking of the design of it now comm like the a you know comm physical attributes comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"um comm and you just have this comm it's like just a long silver thing comm "
A,Task,"or whatever we're thinking . "
A,Elicit,"I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? "
A,Minor,"Or "
C,Task,"It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow "
C,Task,"I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . "
A,Minor,"I mean "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah definitely . "
C,Task,"Like comm I think we're looking at something that could be comm like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . "
A,Task,"okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah but should be comfortable . "
C,Minor,"I mean it it needs to be easy to "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate "
C,Minor,"and use your "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I mean how do how do "
C,Minor,"I'm not really "
C,Task,"Like when I use an iPod comm I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"I use it like that . "
B,Task,"W when we had the wheely remote control comm we it was on the top I think comm if you held it like that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm so "
A,Elicit,"But comm were there buttons on there as well ? "
B,Task,"Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
B,Task,"So we just used the top part . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"but I mean I think it could be pretty small . "
C,Minor,"Like comm I d I mean comm you you want it to be large enough that "
C,Minor,"you can "
A,Task,"What if comm um comm you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? "
A,Minor,"Like you "
A,Task,"so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? "
A,Task,"So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it . "
C,Minor,"But can't you just get "
A,Minor,"Do "
A,Elicit,"do you know what I'm talking about though ? "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Like comm uh comm yeah just something "
B,Task,"Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of "
C,Minor,"K "
D,Task,"Well you can have it on the settings comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that you can flip over comm yeah comm yeah . "
D,Elicit,"no ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"But comm I mean comm do you need that ? "
C,Minor,"If if you can get to comm you know if "
C,Task,"so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen . "
A,Task,"Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"That keeps it "
A,Minor,"is is if w I "
C,Minor,"really "
A,Task,"if we can do this comm that'd probably be "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh you wouldn't "
C,Minor,"I don't "
C,Task,"I just don't think you would even need it . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"So I guess we have to look into the comm um comm like comm the programming comm how this how they actually programme these things comm and if that's "
C,Minor,"Mean "
B,Elicit,"Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ? "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean you can do it comm "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"I mean it would y would that would be "
D,Task,"They already do it . "
C,Minor,"you it's "
B,Task,"I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ comm not inside the remote . "
C,Task,"it doesn't seem that hard . "
C,Task,"I mean I've never bought a remote . "
B,Task,"I'm not sure . "
C,Task,"It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television comm "
C,Minor,"which is a little "
B,Task,"Well they usually are . "
B,Other,"Well "
C,Minor,"My "
C,Task,"I've never bought just a remote comm like comm so I don't I don't really know . "
D,Minor,"No . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Minor,"But um "
B,Task,"I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ . "
C,Minor,"So comm um "
C,Minor,"but I mean it's "
C,Task,"I've never had a hard time with like my remotes comm "
C,Task,"like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever comm you know . "
C,Task,"And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"it "
B,Task,"most of the ones we've had have had the menu button comm "
B,Task,"'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well so "
C,Minor,"So comm do we need "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
C,Minor,"Well I guess we have to you know think about "
C,Task,"But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"That's what it does anyway . "
D,Task,"But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out comm "
D,Task,"because the problem with buttons is you like comm they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"you don't know they mean comm yeah comm "
D,Task,"and I never get it . "
A,Minor,"it's like "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Never ever . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"So comm but "
C,Elicit,"oh comm you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ? "
D,Task,"Well on the telly . "
B,Task,"Or on the T_V_ too . "
C,Task,"On the telly comm okay comm yeah . "
C,Task,"So yeah I think comm I mean comm I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea "
C,Task,"because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like okay now I hit this you know comm you have your little guide out and you're like comm hit this button twice comm like to activate the date . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And it is technologically innovative in a way comm "
A,Minor,"so that fits with the "
C,Task,"Yeah . I guess . "
C,Task,"And it is trendy comm the iPods are really hot right now comm so "
A,Minor,"B "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Did you did you get that pc picture on "
D,Elicit,"did they provide you with that picture on the web ? "
C,Task,"Um comm yeah comm by web research comm yeah comm "
C,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"That's quite interesting . "
D,Elicit,"What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ? "
A,Other,"Oh god . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
B,Other,"Oh comm I was gonna say . "
B,Task,"You said uh people want spongy . "
B,Minor,"Um comm one of your "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in like those stress ball things . "
B,Task,"So comm that would be spongy . "
C,Task,"Oh comm okay comm that would be cool . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Ah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Just nice feel comm but I hate spongy . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"c that's e that would be kind of oh comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"you know comm usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type comm you know comm thing . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda "
A,Task,"I mean definitely the area round it . "
C,Minor,"so you're like "
B,Task,"Yeah I think it could work . "
C,Task,"Or what if we integrated the the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"we somehow made it tactilely fash you know comm we c tapped into that comm so like it feels like "
D,Task,"Well it could be like mobiles that just you just put a cover . "
C,Task,"a vegetable . "
A,Task,"An orange . "
B,Task,"Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"If it's a small thing comm you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana comm "
D,Task,"which frankly I'm not particularly fond of comm "
D,Task,"um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing . "
D,Task,"You know you had there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit comm apple machine and they have like the blueberry comm like all the colours are named after fruits . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You could name it after fruits and vegetables comm or "
D,Task,"And it could the colour can fit your sitting room comm "
D,Task,"so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry comm and then if you have a green one you can have "
D,Task,"well I don't know . Um . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So what if what "
C,Minor,"So I think "
C,Task,"yeah comm colours . "
A,Minor,"this is "
A,Task,"I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . "
A,Task,"If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand comm "
A,Task,"so like what you're feeling is comfortable comm "
A,Task,"and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Is that kind of "
A,Task,"I 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables . "
C,Task,"I do I dunno . "
C,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just the feedback we've just got about the "
D,Task,"Maybe a ball . "
A,Other,"A ball ? "
D,Task,"Know comm a squashy ball . "
D,Task,"A relaxing squashy ball . "
C,Task,"That's in the shape of a fruit comm like a "
D,Minor,"That you can p "
D,Minor,"well I "
D,Task,"see you're thinking comm it's weird comm you're thinking the opposite of me "
D,Task,"'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"and I'm thinking how do you change the hard "
D,Elicit,"would you put a um "
D,Elicit,"sticker sort of ? "
D,Task,"Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit comm "
D,Minor,"like a "
A,Minor,"This is just "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Oh comm okay comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"I was thinking of getting a cover for "
A,Other,"That "
A,Minor,"see I was thinking this s "
D,Task,"Which is cheaper . "
A,Other,"sorry "
D,Task,"Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually . "
A,Task,"I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing . "
B,Minor,"Oh . Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there . "
C,Task,"Oh I like that shape . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um but "
B,Task,"I was thinking sort of a single ball shape . "
A,Task,"I was thinking if it was like this "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So you're holding a squishy ball "
A,Task,"'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy "
B,Minor,"and then it has a "
C,Minor,"It's like it has to be s "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"It's almost like your thumb is farther up comm "
A,Task,"so if if you could squish it lower then "
B,Task,"Yeah I guess so . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So it wouldn't be very big in either "
D,Elicit,"like how big ? "
D,Task,"This big comm and then you just do that comm I suppose . "
C,Minor,"What if comm yeah comm what if the squishy comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I know what you meant comm yeah . "
C,Elicit,"oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable comm "
C,Minor,"and you can "
C,Task,"so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing comm and then you could have like the banana squishy thing "
C,Task,"and you could get you could have your choice comm you know ? "
D,Task,"Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy comm like a a cover . "
D,Task,"But well the question is comm which one's easiest to change "
D,Task,"and we can just contact our relevant department for that comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"and for now we can do two prototypes maybe "
D,Task,"and then hi try and ask users what the best is comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"and "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"No . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"That's nicer . "
D,Task,"I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Well that's not very neat comm but "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I mean I think uh "
C,Task,"and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely "
C,Task,"So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part . "
D,Task,"If it's a bit like those juggling balls comm you can change shape according to your to the way you hold it . "
B,Task,"Yeah you could squish it . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"If it's got sand in it maybe comm or something comm you it it just moulds to your hand . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"So where are the fruit and vegetables now ? "
D,Task,"We we don't know . "
C,Task,"Fruits and veg . "
B,Task,"I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front comm or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"And the rest is the company "
D,Elicit,"the company colour's silver ? "
A,Task,"It was comm yeah comm silver and yellow . "
A,Minor,"It l it looks like "
A,Minor,"I don't "
C,Task,"We could promote the banana one . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Like mm . "
A,Task,"I mean that's another question comm "
A,Minor,"where are we gonna "
A,Task,"we we should have the logo somewhere on it . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Should also fit the batteries comm "
D,Task,"which we haven't "
C,Task,"Oh yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"th and that would that "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . "
B,Task,"Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm I think comm um "
C,Task,"it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . "
C,Task,"The part that you comm yeah comm can change into the different comm you know comm trendy vegetables and fruits . "
C,Minor,"But uh it "
B,Task,"Well I dunno . "
B,Task,"You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . "
B,Task,"Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"No but it does it automatically . "
D,Other,"Does it automatically ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"But if someone "
A,Task,"components concept . Question mark . "
A,Task,"Energy . Question mark . "
B,Task,"That was me . "
A,Other,"Was that you ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Oh right right . Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Um comm so what d but what do we know about "
A,Elicit,"energy ? "
A,Elicit,"I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? "
B,Task,"Uh we actually had an option of batteries comm solar power comm and um a dynamo comm "
A,Minor,"And "
B,Task,"which is something I don't know what it is . "
B,Task,"Something to do with torches . "
D,Task,"Oh comm a dynamo is ah comm it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . "
D,Task,"It's the en it's like if if something moves comm when it moves comm it stores energy . "
B,Task,"Oh okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . "
B,Task,"So I sort of picked battery . "
D,Task,"It's quite sweet . "
B,Task,"We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . "
B,Task,"Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways . "
A,Task,"I think batteries sound good . "
B,Task,"It it seems a little weird for a living room anyways . "
A,Elicit,"What does everyone else think ? "
D,Task,"No . But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is comm the moment you move it comm it c it creates energy on its own . "
C,Task,"The dynamo would be interesting . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
A,Other,"What about Kryptonite ? "
D,Task,"Which is quite cool . "
D,Task,"So if you throw it comm it's gonna store loads of energy comm and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . "
D,Task,"But we need to find cost . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Don't know the cost . "
B,Task,"Didn't have enough data to actually "
D,Elicit,"Does anyone have costs on the on the web ? "
B,Task,"All it said was it gave sort of relative comm some chips are more expensive than others comm sort of things . "
B,Task,"It didn't give me any actual cost . "
D,Task,"Okay . Right . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . "
B,Task,"So I don't think it's that much of a problem . "
B,Task,"Like the chip is probably the most expensive part . "
A,Elicit,"What does chip on print mean ? "
B,Task,"Um comm for things like remote controls comm um comm they stamp out a chip comm "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"calculators too I think . "
B,Task,"Um comm so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But it's not like a computer comm you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls comm it's like stamped onto the chip . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"So comm chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And case ? "
A,Task,"Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about comm "
B,Task,"Case is what we were discussing yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah . Casing . Yeah . "
A,Task,"thinking of like syntactic case and thi "
A,Other,"um let's see . "
A,Elicit,"Is there anything else we need to "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Elicit,"talk about ? "
A,Task,"Oh when we move on comm you two are going to be playing with play-dough . "
A,Task,"Um comm and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . "
A,Task,"And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . "
A,Task,"So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach . "
D,Other,"Oh comm thank you . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Cool . "
A,Task,"See you soon . "
A,Elicit,"Does it matter that I end early ? "
D,Minor,"I it's strange because "
A,Elicit,"How how early is it ? "
A,Task,"I didn't get a pop-up thing that said "
