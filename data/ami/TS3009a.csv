D,Minor,"I dunno . "
D,Other,"Throwing away my toothpick . "
B,Other,"Hi there . "
A,Other,"Yo . "
A,Other,"Ow . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Nice user interface . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"What the "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Yeah well comm ja well let's just start . "
D,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"I've uh made a presentation "
D,Task,"Right let's see it . "
A,Other,"uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard comm so we can all see it . "
A,Task,"So it's in the project documents "
A,Task,"because that's what we can find here . "
A,Minor,"Well . "
A,Task,"Very nice . "
A,Task,"Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting . "
A,Task,"So uh I'm the Project Manager comm "
A,Task,"so I had to fill it in comm "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"and uh hmm . "
A,Minor,"Oh sorry . "
A,Task,"And an uh a nice agenda . "
A,Task,"Uh we'll do the opening "
A,Task,"and then uh we'll meet each other comm "
A,Task,"what uh we already do comm "
A,Task,"so comm that's not uh very much trouble . "
A,Task,"I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here comm so that we can all use them . "
A,Task,"Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction . "
A,Task,"We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project comm "
A,Task,"and then uh we'll close the meeting comm "
A,Task,"and then we can uh individually uh do our things "
A,Task,"and then uh we'll get back here . "
A,Minor,"So this the opening we'll uh "
A,Task,"We have to uh design a new television remote control . "
A,Task,"You have heard that uh already I think comm so . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um we want it to be original comm "
A,Task,"so a nice uh a nice new design . "
A,Task,"Uh trendy comm it's also for young people comm "
A,Task,"and we have to just uh make it uh modern . "
A,Task,"And uh friendly comm "
A,Task,"so size does matter . "
A,Task,"And uh Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place comm that kin those kind of things . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Other uh "
A,Task,"There happen to be uh three stages . "
A,Task,"functional comm conceptual comm and d detailed design . "
A,Task,"Um so every time we we'll do some individual work comm get meeting comm talk about it comm uh and then go into the next phase . "
A,Task,"That's just it . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"We have uh these two Smartboards . "
A,Task,"Um well as I just showed comm there's a project management folder comm a project document folder on the desktop . "
A,Task,"It just works exactly the same as a computer . "
A,Task,"You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . "
A,Task,"So you can uh make uh Words Excel comm everything . "
A,Task,"Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things comm "
A,Task,"you can uh draw . "
A,Task,"This is a uh well a drawing board . "
A,Task,"you have a these different uh functions on the board . "
A,Task,"You can see them there . "
A,Task,"So you have a a nice pen comm "
A,Task,"and it's works just like a bal ball pen . "
A,Minor,"This is just a . "
A,Minor,"I want to uh "
A,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
A,Task,"Of course w doesn't work any more . "
C,Task,"Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh "
C,Elicit,"Does it ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . It works . "
A,Task,"Yes I will "
A,Minor,"eraser so . "
A,Task,"It's fantas fantastic . "
C,Task,"Wonderful . "
A,Task,"We can uh uh well you can save a file . "
A,Task,"So if uh we draw we have to save everything . "
A,Task,"Don't throw anything away . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Uh just we can start a new one comm and we just go on comm and don't throw anything away . "
A,Task,"Just uh let them all uh stand here . "
A,Task,"We can delete comm but we don't do that . "
A,Task,"Um you can here select a pen comm "
A,Task,"you can draw anything you want . "
A,Task,"It's a bit uh childish you have to write . "
A,Task,"It's not as fast as you w you know it comm "
A,Task,"but it does work sometimes . "
A,Task,"Well it's just like a normal uh paint . "
C,Minor,". "
A,Task,"So it's gone . "
C,Minor,"Alright comm yep . "
A,Task,"Well we are designers comm so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard . "
A,Task,"So that's fantastic . "
A,Task,"Um well this uh speaks for itself . "
A,Task,"We going to try it . "
A,Task,"So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board comm "
A,Task,"not my idea . "
D,Elicit,"Alright comm your favourite animal ? "
A,Task,"Yes our your favourite . "
A,Other,"So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo comm "
A,Task,"but I'm going d I'm not going to . "
A,Other,"I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast "
A,Task,"w I dunno what I'm going to design . "
D,Task,"Grizzly bear . "
A,Minor,"Oh um doesn't oh . "
C,Task,"I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm 'kay . "
A,Other,"Hmm ? "
C,Task,"I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment . "
A,Task,"I just said it's not my idea "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but I am the Project Manager comm "
A,Task,"and officially this is my idea . "
C,Other,"I I I I understand . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"We're kinda losing time comm though . "
C,Other,"Alright . "
A,Other,"what ? "
D,Task,"We're losing time comm but "
A,Task,"Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose comm loosen up comm a bit uh meeting each other "
C,Minor,"so start "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"well uh uh nice yeah . Sh "
C,Minor,"Yep yes . "
A,Other,"I hope our Industrial Designer does this better "
A,Minor,"because uh this is uh "
C,Other,"Don't uh count on it . "
A,Minor,"No "
A,Other,"so a a few legs . "
D,Elicit,"Do we have to guess ? "
D,Task,"A hippo ? "
A,Task,"Yes yes "
A,Elicit,"guess . "
A,Other,"Well I should make it an hippo now . "
C,Task,"I think it's a mouse or a rat . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No I don't think so . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
C,Other,"Oh I know it . "
A,Elicit,"Well what is it comm huh ? "
C,Task,"It's a hedgehog . "
D,Task,"I don't know how to call it . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
D,Other,"A hedgehog ? "
A,Task,"difficult English word . "
A,Task,"I didn't knew it myself . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Well I'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills . "
A,Task,"Our characteristics sum it up . "
A,Task,"Well it's uh very uh painful "
A,Minor,"those kind of thing . "
A,Minor,"So we can uh just uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We're going back "
A,Task,"and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
C,Task,"I am the Industrial Designer . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Task,"Chief comm I am the Industrial Designer . "
A,Task,"Oh uh but this uh marketing designer . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think It's pr it resembles the animal drawn by . "
D,Task,"It's . "
A,Elicit,"what kind of animal is that then ? "
C,Minor,"I think "
C,Other,"can I say it ? "
D,Task,"Yeah sure . "
A,Minor,"Uh it . "
D,Task,"It's a rabbit . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"Looks very nice comm right ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It looks amazing . "
A,Task,"No no no . "
A,Elicit,"What are you going to do ? "
B,Task,"We want to erase it . "
A,Task,"No no . "
A,Task,"No no "
A,Task,"save it and start a new uh "
A,Task,"save it "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"These are very impor "
A,Task,"and start a new black uh doc a blank document . "
C,Task,"These are very important documents comm of course comm uh these drawings comm uh "
A,Task,"Yeah well we have to save everything "
D,Minor,"Yes uh right . "
A,Elicit,"so now um the next one uh "
D,Task,"You go man . "
A,Task,"and then save it and start an blank document . "
B,Other,"Thanks . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"There's also different colours "
A,Task,"and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness . "
A,Task,"So um well you should uh try it but uh "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Task,"I should have made mine a white rabbit . "
A,Task,"Well y y y you could have but uh . "
C,Task,"And he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the English word for . "
A,Task,"It speaks for itself . "
A,Minor,"What the "
C,Minor,"It looks like an uh "
A,Task,"uh just a duck . "
C,Task,"It looks like that beast from Sesame Street . "
D,Minor,". "
A,Task,"Nice . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Big bird . "
A,Elicit,"Is it a duck ? "
D,Task,"You're standing in front of it comm "
C,Minor,"It's it's uh "
D,Task,"I can't see it . "
A,Elicit,"Is it a plane ? "
D,Other,"Alright comm thank you . "
D,Task,"Yeah it's a bird comm "
D,Elicit,"but what kind of bird ? "
A,Task,"It doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh . "
C,Minor,"Do we have to uh "
D,Task,"You have to push harder . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"just a bit a bit childish comm "
A,Minor,"a bit . "
C,Elicit,"But we have uh do we have to name the specific species of the bird ? "
D,Other,"Release your anger . "
B,Task,"Uh no I don't . "
C,Elicit,"No ? "
B,Task,"It's just a bird . "
C,Task,"Well wonderful . "
A,Task,"Well uh save the document "
A,Minor,"and then uh "
A,Task,"And then a a new blank document for . "
A,Task,"uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it . "
B,Other,"Here you go . "
C,Elicit,"Why do I have to do the difficult tasks ? "
C,Task,"Uh pen "
A,Minor,"No well first "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"yeah that's . "
A,Task,"And then you go to format I think comm "
C,Task,"Uh current colour . "
A,Task,"and current colour "
A,Task,"you choose a new colour . "
A,Task,"And a new pen width uh also format . "
C,Minor,"I like uh "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"oh they don't have pink . "
C,Minor,"Oh b oh think this is uh "
A,Task,"It's not like in paint . "
C,Minor,"Uh ? Uh "
A,Task,"Line width . "
A,Task,"And you can choose a nice one . "
C,Task,"Line width . "
B,Task,"Width . "
A,Other,"Width width . "
C,Task,"Uh fifteen . "
A,Other,"With each other . "
C,Elicit,"And I can draw ? "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So . Just a wa that's the way we do "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"it's quite easy . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"It's a pussy cat . "
D,Task,"It's a cat . "
A,Other,"Oh Pussy . "
C,Task,"Oh the line width is too thick comm but oh well . "
A,Task,"Well then you change it . "
A,Task,"And erase things . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Other,"What ? "
D,Task,"It's a pig . "
C,Task,"It smiles nicely . "
A,Other,"Super pig . "
C,Other,"Now I have to change the line width . "
C,Other,"Uh one . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"These are whiskers comm you know . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah "
D,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"we know . "
C,Task,"Uh well I think it's obvious right now . "
A,Task,"Yes alright . "
A,Task,"It's a cat . "
D,Task,"No it looks great . "
C,Other,"Miaow . "
C,Task,"Well if this isn't obvious "
A,Minor,"Well well um "
D,Task,"Just save it . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
C,Other,"I'll save it alright uh save . "
A,Task,"save it and start a new blank document . "
C,Task,"Uh yeah uh blank . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it . "
C,Task,"Well I feel comfortable now . "
D,Task,"Oh great . "
A,Task,"Well it's terrific comm eh ? "
C,Other,"Thanks for this exercise . "
D,Task,"It's good for group spirit . "
C,Task,"I feel totally at ease . "
A,Task,"Yeah that's it . "
B,Task,"It certainly is . "
A,Other,"We're one big happy family now . "
C,Task,"Yeah something like that . "
A,Task,"Well then uh the serious uh stuff . "
A,Task,"We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally "
A,Task,"um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars comm but uh twenty five Euros . "
A,Task,"Our profit aim is comm worldwide comm fifty million Euros . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . "
A,Task,"we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros "
A,Task,"so comm keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff comm and uh marketing uh research . "
D,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls comm "
A,Task,"first about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ? "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Well uh we c we can sit down uh "
A,Task,"because uh presentation can wait . "
A,Task,"We can uh take notes and uh "
A,Elicit,"Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? "
C,Task,"Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh "
A,Elicit,"Please ? "
A,Task,"No uh I did . "
C,Task,"it's not comm it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls comm "
C,Minor,"but uh "
A,Minor,"Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then "
D,Task,"I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Get the good points "
D,Task,"uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player "
A,Task,"That's alright . "
A,Task,"That would be a nice idea comm yes . "
D,Task,"so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control . "
A,Task,"Yep yep yep . "
D,Task,"Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world comm for different cultures comm maybe comm "
D,Task,"because we want to we want to well fifty million ? "
A,Task,"Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit comm so . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah "
D,Task,"so a lot of people have to be able to use it . "
C,Task,"No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Easy to learn . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"and numbers and uh that every culture in uh comm yeah comm people in every country can recognise . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"I'll make uh notes "
A,Minor,"and then uh maybe uh "
A,Other,"well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
B,Task,"I also think we should not add too many buttons . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think . "
A,Task,"No that's right . "
A,Task,"Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's "
B,Task,"Precisely . "
A,Other,"culture uh international . "
D,Task,"Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something . "
B,Task,"Yeah indeed . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh "
D,Task,"Yeah right . "
A,Minor,"Yep comm "
A,Task,"and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . "
A,Elicit,"Don't we have uh other uh ou "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use comm we uh we make ? "
C,Task,"And stereo uh s uh audio installations . "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw . "
D,Task,"Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . "
B,Task,"So we can keep that in mind . "
C,Task,"Most people do comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Well yeah . "
C,Minor,"It doesn't "
C,Minor,"it doesn't have to be "
A,Task,"It doesn't have to be comm but we can . "
B,Task,"W well it's a n it's a new remote "
B,Task,"and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it . "
A,Task,"Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ . "
D,Minor,"Yeah but "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah alright comm but "
D,Task,"We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh "
A,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"Well . "
A,Task,"because we look at competitors "
A,Task,"and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"but it's it has to be useable . "
C,Task,"It has to be different and familiar at the same time . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah "
B,Task,"we could use another form or shape or colour comm that kind of things . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . "
C,Task,"I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"you can make it uh triangle shaped comm "
C,Task,"but that's not uh very recognisable . "
B,Task,"Well we we could make more more oval or something comm and and "
A,Minor,"Oo "
D,Minor,"No . "
C,Other,"Oval ? "
A,Task,"N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . "
C,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"Yeah or so "
A,Task,"So one hand has the beer comm so the other hand uh "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Well yeah it's new . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Not with two hands . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah comm right . "
D,Minor,"No "
B,Task,"but young people want something different "
B,Minor,"and it is "
A,Minor,"Well i we already uh "
D,Task,"Yeah but it's quite important that it fits . "
A,Task,"one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Oh but it ha it has to be m "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"But you still have to know it's a remote and not another "
B,Minor,"Yeah alright . "
A,Task,"Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh "
A,Task,"because it's a long time uh on the market . "
A,Task,"So the the form will have been uh tested out so "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh comm yeah comm useful "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"or else uh they would have been ano another shape . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home "
A,Task,"but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them . "
A,Task,"I have uh have to it has to fit my hands . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here . "
D,Task,"It shouldn't be boxy . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah "
C,Task,"a lo the long box shape yeah . "
C,Task,"You have to use one hand . "
A,Task,"It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb . "
D,Task,"Nah "
D,Task,"I don't agree with the long box uh shape "
D,Task,"it it has to be custom made for the hand . "
C,Elicit,"Why not ? "
B,Task,"Yeah it doesn't fit . "
A,Task,"Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this comm "
C,Task,"and you can make it another shape comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah but if you shape it "
C,Minor,"but then you have "
B,Task,"No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped . "
D,Minor,"If "
A,Task,"D_V_D_ players . Yes . "
C,Elicit,"W no w what else ? "
D,Task,"No that's ol old fashioned . "
C,Minor,"I di "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ? "
D,Minor,"I can imagine that us "
B,Minor,"Yes uh "
B,Task,"Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end comm "
B,Task,"and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . "
D,Task,"Yeah right . "
D,Task,"It fits in your palms . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . Well "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"but it's still then uh the the long box comm "
C,Task,"uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand comm "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"it "
D,Minor,"Hmm ? "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"but it's it's still "
C,Other,"Yeah yeah al alright "
C,Task,"but but it's still it's still sort of box comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"That's "
D,Minor,". "
C,Task,"It it has round forms "
B,Task,"Yeah yea "
C,Task,"but it in the end it's still the box comm so that's what I mean . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . "
C,Other,"Yeah yeah I understand comm "
D,Task,"It shouldn't be too boxy comm you know . "
C,Task,"but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square "
D,Minor,"It's "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"No no no . "
C,Task,"but a also with round edges of course comm "
C,Task,"but in in in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh to fit . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Right "
D,Task,"maybe something like this "
C,Task,"Yeah yes "
D,Task,"and then a button here to switch between different systems like D_V_D_ player "
C,Task,"I thought about something like that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"and so you can I've "
C,Task,"A big recognisable button on top or something . "
D,Task,"Yeah right comm "
D,Task,"and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We have five minutes left . "
C,Task,"The buttons should uh also be not too small comm not too big comm of course comm "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . "
A,Task,"Yes "
A,Minor,"uh that's yep . "
D,Task,"But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"So there has to be some space between the buttons . "
C,Task,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah right right comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and maybe we should use colours . "
C,Task,"Colours comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Ha . "
B,Task,"and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs "
D,Task,"That's kinda trendy . "
D,Task,"Yeah right . "
B,Task,"I dunno but "
A,Task,"Sound nice . Yes . "
C,Task,"I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"Well it's just uh about our first ideas now "
A,Task,"so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . "
C,Minor,". "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"But "
C,Minor,"Already thought about something tha "
A,Other,"Yes ? "
D,Task,"I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make comm "
