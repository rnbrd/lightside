Speaker,DialogAct,Text
A,Other,"Uh welcome back after lunch comm "
A,Other,"I hope uh you had a good lunch "
A,Other,"together . "
A,Task,"For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . "
A,Task,"Okay and the agenda will be the opening "
A,Task,"and uh that's uh the product manager or secretary that's me "
A,Task,"and uh the presentations from the Christine and uh Agnes and from Mister Ed . "
A,Minor,"And finally in this meeting we have to decide "
A,Task,"and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design "
A,Task,"So we have forty minutes comm "
A,Task,"I think it's uh little bit uh low comm "
A,Task,"but I I hope we can finish it up "
A,Task,"so I'll handle to the the functional team comm "
A,Task,"to the Christine comm okay comm "
A,Task,"to discuss about uh the components concept . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So uh comm if you could open the PowerPoint presentation . "
C,Task,"I'm number two . "
A,Other,"You're number two . "
A,Other,"'Kay "
C,Task,"Components design comm "
C,Task,"there we go . "
C,Task,"So uh can we put it in slide show mode ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"The next one . "
C,Task,"Right here comm "
C,Minor,"is that little "
C,Task,"that one comm "
C,Other,"yes please . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Other,"I'll take the mouse . "
C,Minor,"So uh "
C,Task,"we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components comm "
C,Task,"uh the case comm the power supply comm uh the means of communications with the television set . "
C,Task,"In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition comm "
C,Task,"you have to have microphone "
C,Task,"well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device comm "
C,Minor,"but um "
C,Minor,"maybe you do have it a a way "
C,Task,"it has to it has to hear the speaker "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"and um comm "
C,Task,"so it could be in the television set comm could be in the device comm "
C,Task,"but somewhere you have to put the microphone comm "
C,Minor,"um "
C,Task,"and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . "
C,Minor,"Um so the other w thing that we So . "
C,Task,"Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record comm what's worked comm what hasn't "
C,Task,"and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials "
C,Task,"and we contacted manufacturing for their input "
C,Elicit,"because comm course comm we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us comm "
C,Minor,"so uh "
C,Task,"this is the approach that we took during our um our research . "
C,Task,"So um for the case comm um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . "
C,Task,"Course comm you know comm I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable comm "
C,Task,"but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore comm "
C,Task,"so then we were thinking about um rubber comm "
C,Task,"but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor "
C,Task,"and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's uh goes with the board . "
C,Task,"Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while comm "
C,Task,"so um we still had titanium and and wood available comm "
C,Task,"but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh comm "
C,Task,"the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium comm "
C,Task,"although how Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure "
C,Minor,"but uh "
C,Task,"nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood . "
C,Task,"So comm this is our finding . "
B,Task,"At least it's environmentally friendly . "
C,Task,"And a as she said comm it's an environmentally friendly uh material comm "
C,Minor,"so we're we're currently uh proposing comm "
C,Task,"uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . "
C,Task,"So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board comm "
C,Task,"uh these simple chips comm but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . "
C,Task,"And um then there was the regular which "
C,Task,"I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . "
C,Task,"Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print comm "
C,Minor,"and uh we liked th we "
C,Task,"we found that it it includes this infrared sender comm "
C,Task,"which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . "
C,Task,"And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print comm "
C,Minor,"so uh we we uh "
C,Task,"now jumping right to our personal preferences "
C,Task,"um I I'd really think we should comm you know comm use some of uh some really exotic woods comm like um comm "
C,Task,"you know uh comm well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . "
C,Task,"I think that people will might really want to design their own cases comm "
C,Task,"you see comm they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet comm "
C,Task,"and then they could submit their orders comm kinda like you submit a custom car order comm you know comm "
C,Task,"and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that comm "
C,Task,"and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . "
C,Task,"So this is the findings of our research "
C,Task,"and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . "
C,Elicit,"Do you have any problems with that ? "
A,Task,"Can you go back uh one slide ? "
C,Task,"I'm not sure comm how do I "
C,Other,"Oh comm I know comm let's see . "
B,Other,"Thank you . Yeah . "
C,Other,"Let's go back up here . "
A,Minor,"Yes comm uh "
A,Elicit,"question comm uh comm what's mean exactly comm advanced chip on print ? "
A,Elicit,"What's the meaning of that ? "
C,Task,"I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um "
C,Task,"and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"is it means it's on the yeah "
A,Elicit,"is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh "
C,Task,"I don't know comm "
C,Other,"but I'll find out more at our next meeting . "
A,Task,"Okay comm tha that would be great comm "
A,Task,"so if you find out from the technology background comm okay comm "
A,Task,"so that would be good . "
C,Task,"Sounds good . "
B,Elicit,"Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? "
C,Task,"Because um it gets brittle comm cracks "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"We want "
C,Task,"we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . "
C,Minor,"So . "
C,Other,"Good ex Good expression . "
B,Minor,"Whic "
D,Task,"Wow comm "
B,Minor,"Which "
D,Other,"good expression . "
D,Task,"Well after us . "
C,Other,"I don't know comm speak for yourself comm I'm planning to be around for a while . "
B,Minor,"Although I think "
B,Task,"I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems comm "
B,Elicit,"wouldn't you comm "
B,Task,"I mean it chips comm it if you drop it comm "
B,Minor,"uh it's I'm not su "
A,Task,"So so you're not convinced about the the wood comm yes . "
D,Task,"Actually comm I'm ready to sell it . "
C,Other,"you're what ? "
D,Task,"I'm ready to sell it . "
B,Task,"I think if you re if you use really good quality wood comm then it might work comm "
C,Other,"You think ? "
D,Task,"No y no no no comm "
C,Task,"And you could you could sell oils with it comm to take care of it . "
B,Minor,"but you can't just use "
D,Task,"the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard comm extremely hard wood comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm exactly comm yeah . "
D,Task,"but there are some very pretty woods out there . "
C,Minor,"Well I'm glad you "
D,Task,"That's actually very innovative idea . "
C,Task,"Okay comm good . "
C,Other,"Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . "
D,Task,"Well comm it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood comm your type of wood . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"The stain . "
D,Task,"I mean it's each person is gonna have their own personalised comm individualised speech recognition remote control in wood comm that's not on the market . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh comm "
A,Elicit,"what about yo you ? "
B,Minor,"Um comm "
B,Other,"in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own "
A,Task,"Yes comm in t yes comm in term in terms of comments first "
D,Other,"In turns of wow . "
C,Task,"She works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this . "
B,Task,"Y yeah . "
C,Task,"Luckily Ed was not . "
D,Other,"Wood ? "
B,Task,"I think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much comm which you'll see with my presentation . "
B,Task,"One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your "
B,Task,"Yeah comm for example . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that comm "
B,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it comm they can use it for teething . "
D,Task,"They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic comm "
D,Other,"so comm and chew 'em up . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm they do it with other materials as well comm yeah . "
D,Other,"And chew 'em up . "
A,Task,"Okay then comm uh comm let's move to Agnes . "
B,Task,"Sure . "
C,Other,"Oh comm I'm sorry . "
A,Minor,"S you're "
A,Task,"You are in participant three . "
B,Task,"One point three comm yeah "
B,Task,"Uh comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"This one ? "
B,Task,"I think so comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's the one . "
B,Task,"So comm it's a very short presentation comm "
B,Task,"'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board "
B,Task,"so if you want to just go straight to the second slide comm "
B,Minor,"um comm which basically shows comm sort of "
B,Task,"I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch comm volume and channel control comm the menu access button comm ergonomic shape comm "
B,Task,"which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded comm so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . "
B,Task,"And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea comm is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size comm "
B,Task,"so if someone has larger hands comm you have a wider remote control . "
C,Task,"Right comm "
C,Task,"my hand is uh different size than yours for example . "
B,Task,"So comm that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . "
B,Task,"Um comm one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it comm just like you have on flip phones comm "
B,Task,"so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it comm "
B,Task,"especially if you have little kids around comm they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And also um you had issues with the batteries running out comm "
B,Task,"so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . "
B,Task,"And in terms of invisible features comm audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and comm like you said comm speech recognition . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"So comm in terms of what this thing would actually look like "
B,Task,"Despite working in interface design comm I'm not the greatest artist in the world comm so you'll have to forgive me . "
B,Task,"You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big comm "
B,Task,"sort of in the corner and by itself comm so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . "
B,Task,"And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for comm oops comm channels and volume comm sort of for surfing channels and then volume comm "
B,Task,"so the volume would be the up and down comm 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . "
B,Task,"And then here you'd have your sort of standard comm telephonish number pad . "
B,Task,"And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ "
B,Task,"and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . "
B,Task,"So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice comm they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um comm so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere comm the flip thing and "
B,Elicit,"Have I forgotten anything ? "
B,Task,"I don't think so . "
B,Task,"So comm as you can see comm it's a very very simple design comm "
D,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"which is one of the things I really wanted to keep comm is keep it simple comm not have too many buttons comm not have too many functionalities thrown into it . "
B,Task,"Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything comm "
B,Elicit,"although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . "
C,Task,"A hinge . "
C,Task,"Be like a copper hinge or you know . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But you also have to d start watching out for the weight comm "
B,Task,"'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control comm you don't want it to start getting too heavy . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"But that's the general layout with the general functionalities comm if we come up with something else . "
B,Task,"As you can see comm there's still lots of space on the actual remote control "
B,Task,"and if you do it customisably comm you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large comm depending on personal preferences . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"So comm that's pretty much all I had to say comm "
B,Minor,"I mean comm everything else in terms of design issues . "
B,Task,"Um the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is "
B,Task,"and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad comm "
B,Task,"so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So once we decide exactly what we want comm then we can figure out the exact positioning comm "
B,Task,"but more or less I think it should go along those lines . "
A,Elicit,"So what's your comm uh comm the comments or uh s "
D,Task,"Simple design . "
D,Task,"It's what consumers want . "
A,Task,"Okay "
D,Task,"It's almost like comm Houston comm we have a product here . "
D,Task,"Problem is obviously gonna be cost . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"I also have a f very simple presentation comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I also have uh copied a different type of remote . "
D,Task,"If you can find me comm where I'm at . "
D,Task,"There should only be one in here . "
D,Task,"trend watch . "
C,Task,"Sure . "
D,Task,"It's being modified . "
D,Other,"They're stealing our product . "
D,Task,"We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas "
D,Task,"because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today comm "
D,Task,"'cause uh trends change very very quickly . "
D,Task,"In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window comm so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . "
D,Other,"Uh they already erased the rest of mine comm huh . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"f go to findings . "
B,Minor,"No comm no . "
D,Task,"No no comm no no . "
D,Task,"'Cause I had another comment there . "
D,Task,"Uh the market trend . This is what we know from the last uh from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we've done comm "
D,Task,"fancy and feel-good comm that's what we've been looking for comm "
D,Task,"something that feels good in the hand comm that's easy to use . "
D,Task,"Looking for next generation of innovation comm "
D,Task,"because all the remotes out there now comm they're all very similar comm they all do the same thing comm "
D,Task,"we have to have something completely different . "
D,Minor,"Okay ? "
D,Task,"Easy to use comm has always has become has become another major interest that uh comm "
D,Task,"with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . "
D,Task,"And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . "
D,Task,"So even if we have a product that may be more expensive comm if it comes out right comm if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . "
D,Task,"The second two comm you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . "
D,Task,"The second one comm there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it comm which makes it fairly hard to read comm uh very hard to use . "
D,Task,"The first one comm I see that they put in a display . "
D,Task,"Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up comm now we're adding all kinds of things in comm "
D,Task,"but with the little flip-up comm if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Maybe the display also makes it easier to use comm "
D,Task,"because sometimes when you're looking for buttons comm maybe if you see a display "
C,Task,"Context-sensitive instructions comm depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Okay "
D,Task,"Because I've seen mostly the standard ones comm "
B,Task,"Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . "
D,Task,"The idea is simple comm but with a display comm so you can see what you're doing . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use comm trendy comm fancy comm feels good comm uh with a display comm wood comm designer wood comm designer colours "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"You know comm maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball comm "
D,Minor,"comm we might've "
B,Other,"Oh yeah . "
C,Task,"and then they would squeeze it comm and it would take the shape of their hand . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so it's really molded to to your specific "
C,Minor,"To t an "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh "
D,Other,"How hard they squeeze ? "
C,Task,"Yes "
D,Other,"Resistance resistance comm right . "
C,Task,"you'd know what kind of wood to get . "
B,Task,"But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . "
C,Task,"That's right comm that's right comm you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . "
C,Task,"Oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect comm yeah . "
B,Task,"The sales comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"The "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I hope so . "
D,Task,"No comm but incorporating the three uh obviously it'd be something totally new on the market comm totally different "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"and from "
B,Task,"Well comm already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . "
D,Minor,"Although comm what it was it uh "
D,Task,"it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Right comm you take it apart comm and put on another face comm take it off and put on another face "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Right comm mm . "
D,Task,"and then they sold millions comm millions . "
B,Task,"And that took off comm yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"So . "
D,Task,"So say with the f with the findings comm with the research comm easy to use something totally new . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market . "
C,Task,"We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes comm "
C,Task,"we might wanna um learn about um labour laws . "
C,Task,"You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap comm "
C,Task,"but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but we can get a production in comm uh comm countries like comm uh comm India "
C,Task,"Cost of living is low . "
A,Task,"yes comm yes comm "
A,Task,"countries like India or China or Malaysia comm "
A,Task,"so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Good comm "
C,Task,"well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm so "
B,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
C,Minor,"and to where "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Where w Where it would be manufactured is is another step . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm so "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"We're here to design comm come up with a nice product . "
A,Minor,"Yes uh comm "
A,Task,"but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later comm okay comm depends on the the quantity comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something comm "
A,Task,"so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric comm okay comm for the different uh electronics items comm "
A,Task,"then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost comm okay comm to sell more . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept comm okay comm "
A,Elicit,"if is acceptable for both of you comm what uh Ed was talking . "
A,Elicit,"And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple comm so "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I think it depends comm "
B,Task,"I mean I think it's a good idea comm "
B,Task,"but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be "
B,Task,"because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"So comm if we're trying to keep costs down comm then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"very specifically what it would be used for comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"'cause if it's only used for one little thing comm then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever comm may not be the most cost-efficient way to go comm "
B,Task,"but that's just sort of speculation comm I mean . "
C,Elicit,"What do you think Ed ? "
C,Minor,"Do you "
C,Task,"he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed comm "
C,Minor,"um comm "
C,Elicit,"do you know how much it costs comm um comm to to add a little display like this uh ? "
D,Elicit,"No . No "
C,Task,"Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? "
D,Minor,"no p spec "
D,Task,"It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Sorry about that . "
D,Other,"Um comm no that's no problem . "
D,Task,"I'm here for the pushing it after it's made . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"I will market it . "
D,Task,"Once we get a price on it then we can market it . "
C,Task,"So the the advanced chip on print is what um what we've we've deci we've determined "
C,Task,"and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation comm "
C,Task,"and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"A customisable and "
D,Task,"Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . "
B,Elicit,"What about the buttons comm would Would the buttons be wood too comm or "
C,Task,"Uh I don't think so comm no comm "
A,Task,"I don't think so . "
C,Task,"I think they could be rubber like they are now comm "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"so you have that tactile experience of "
A,Task,"Don't looks nice uh . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm so uh "
A,Task,"what we'll do is comm uh comm we will stick with the the simple design for time being "
A,Task,"until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra comm in case we go for the display . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
A,Task,"maybe what you can do is uh comm both of you comm you can come up with the the prototype comm okay comm the model . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
B,Other,"Sure . "
C,Minor,"So um "
C,Elicit,"are we done with this meeting ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I hope comm "
A,Minor,"if "
A,Elicit,"is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design comm okay . "
A,Task,"Then they can show you how it looks like comm "
A,Minor,"and then we can uh submit to the "
A,Task,"I will submit to the management . "
A,Minor,"Okay ? "
A,Task,"Then meantime you can come up with the price comm how much it's cost as extra for uh the display . "
C,Task,"And a marketing strategy . "
A,Task,"An and the marketing strategy comm that's very important comm okay . "
D,Task,"And marketing strategy comm thank you . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"How much you can "
