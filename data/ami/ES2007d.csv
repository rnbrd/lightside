D,Task,"It's Play-Doh . "
A,Task,"Play-Doh's edible . "
A,Elicit,"Did you know that ? "
A,Task,"It's definitely "
D,Task,"Because kids yeah . "
B,Task,"I used to eat it . "
C,Task,"I've comm I've definitely eaten it before . "
C,Task,"I didn't know was edible . . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"But um comm it's it's made edible 'cause comm "
A,Task,"It's it's chew proof . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"It's made edible 'cause kids eat it comm "
D,Minor,"and if it's wasn't edible then "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Well comm normal babies . "
C,Task,"Actually that makes sense comm "
C,Task,"because I remember like comm peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Oh yeah it is comm yeah . Oh yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"Everybody everybody ready ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Okay comm let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation ? "
C,Minor,"We've got some . "
B,Task,"We've got a cool prototype . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's pretty exciting . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"everything uh that we wanted "
C,Task,"we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber comm "
C,Task,"very simple and easy to use comm "
B,Task,"Double curved . "
C,Task,"yeah comm double curved comm "
A,Minor,"Nice . "
C,Task,"um but also something that was gonna jump out at people comm "
C,Task,"something that would be different uh comm "
C,Task,"separate it from the other remotes out on the market . "
C,Task,"So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand comm you'll see what a nice thing we have going here . "
D,Task,"That is cool . "
C,Task,"So comm basically comm if you hold it like that comm the one on your thumb comm yeah comm the thumb button is the power button . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Your index finger is channel up comm middle finger is channel down comm "
C,Task,"ring finger is volume up comm your pinkie is volume down . "
D,Elicit,"What's the big blue thing ? "
C,Task,"That's the lock button comm "
C,Task,"has a L_ L_ on it "
D,Task,"Oh cool . "
C,Task,"and then the M_ is a mute button . "
C,Task,"And then it also has digit "
A,Other,"what button ? "
A,Other,"Um . Oh mute . "
D,Task,"And mute . "
C,Task,"For muting the uh "
C,Task,"Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available comm "
C,Task,"but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . "
A,Task,"That certainly does . "
C,Task,"So all the comm I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"So you don't you "
B,Task,"Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ . "
C,Task,"Yeah . It should be . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . "
C,Task,"I mean if that's too big comm it's a rubber remote comm so you can comm you know "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'S great . "
C,Task,"change that . "
D,Task,"Oh it's so cute . "
C,Elicit,"So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it "
A,Task,"I have one thing about it comm but it's a small thing comm "
A,Task,"but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . "
C,Task,"Ah comm that's good thinking comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Oh right comm yeah . "
A,Task,"But comm that's I don't see why that's not possible . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"They make left-handed scissors comm you know . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm but then "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I didn't I didn't think about that comm but I'd yeah comm . "
D,Task,"but then you can learn to use your right h "
D,Elicit,"like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family comm what comm they have two remotes ? "
A,Minor,"Yes s "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse comm and everybody is using right-handed mouse . "
A,Minor,"Mm . Sure . Sure . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I'm sure they'll be able to "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"I mean it's only pressing buttons comm "
D,Task,"you don't have to do anything comm you know comm extraordinary . "
D,Task,"I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Imagine d are you right handed ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Imagine you're doing it with your left hand comm "
B,Task,"I don't think it's too "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it's not "
B,Task,"But we can have both uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Have them in stock . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Make 'em more appealing as well . "
A,Task,"But um other than that comm "
A,Task,"I mean uh and that's um comm you know comm that's just something comm "
A,Task,"I think I think it's great comm yeah comm great idea . "
C,Elicit,"Do you think it says R_R_ ? "
B,Task,"I think it does . "
A,Task,"I think it's comm well comm if the R_R_ motto is comm we bring fashion to to electronics comm I'd say that could be quite fashionable . "
C,Task,"Fashion to electronics . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue . "
C,Task,"Plus red comm which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"There you go . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Task,"So that's that's our end of things "
C,Minor,"wha uh "
C,Minor,"That's "
A,Task,"Yeah comm very good comm yeah . "
A,Task,"It's come up with what we've you know comm the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing comm hasn't it comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"all seems to be there . "
A,Task,"Well done . "
D,Minor,"And all the playing around is uh "
A,Task,"Um before we move on "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm I'm just "
D,Elicit,"do you wanna plug in ? "
A,Task,"I need that cable . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Um . "
A,Task,"One thing I do need to do we need to look at comm is the costs . "
C,Other,"The costs comm was that what you said ? "
B,Task,"Play-Doh is very cheap . "
A,Task,"Well comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Play-Doh won't last very long "
A,Minor,"um "
D,Task,"everybody'll go like comm oops comm it's gone . "
C,Task,"But it's edible . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Chew proof . "
D,Other,"Well comm they'll buy more of them if you eat them comm . "
C,Other,"That was the main criteria from the last meeting comm it had to be chew proof . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh right . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm now I think we'll do this "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I could do you know comm I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you comm "
B,Other,"Oh ho-ho . "
A,Task,"but it's just easy enough to go through it with you comm "
A,Task,"so we're going for the kinetic power . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"And the electronics comm we decided on it being just a simple comm the easiest thing that's inside it . "
A,Other,"Ooh . "
A,Task,"So the case comm we've gone for the double curved . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"and it's made out of rubber . "
A,Task,"The interface is push-buttons . "
A,Task,"And button supplements "
A,Task,"well they're in diff special colours comm "
A,Elicit,"aren't they ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So special colours . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"It's better for "
A,Task,"Special form comm "
A,Task,"yeah comm they're a special form there in shapes and stuff . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"And special material . "
C,Task,"I mean comm these these ones on the side are curved kind of comm so "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Are they made out of any special material ? "
B,Task,"Rubber . "
A,Task,"No they're not . "
A,Task,"They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything comm they're just simple "
D,Task,"Well they're rubber comm aren't they ? "
C,Task,"The buttons are rubber . "
A,Task,"Okay . Right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So let's see if that comes within budget . "
A,Task,"And it does . "
A,Minor,"That is gonna cost uh "
D,Task,"We're under budget . "
B,Minor,". "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . "
A,Task,"And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . "
C,Task,"That's cool . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected . "
A,Task,"this is all very very good . "
A,Task,"The bosses will be very pleased . "
A,Other,"Okay comm let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . Uh . "
A,Other,"Save it in save it in the uh my documents . "
D,Task,"It's already saved comm I think . "
A,Task,"Splendid . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So uh comm that's done with this with this um doodah comm "
A,Task,"so you're . Gonna do what you were gonna do comm "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"your evaluation . "
D,Task,"Oh comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"This is where we all get to "
D,Other,"I get to write on the comm oops comm on the board . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"'S function "
A,Task,"F_ eight . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I love the smell of that Play-Doh . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"have some have some . "
A,Minor,"I cou . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So comm evaluation . "
D,Task,"We're gonna do it all together "
D,Task,"so we evaluate each criteria . "
D,Task,"I've got the criterias . "
D,Task,"And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven comm "
D,Task,"one being true comm so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria comm "
D,Task,"and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . "
D,Minor,"And the criterias are comm "
D,Other,"and I'll draw this up on the board "
D,Task,"so we have a box "
D,Minor,". "
D,Task,"And this is false comm "
D,Task,"this is just like to keep you informed . "
D,Task,"So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . "
D,Task,"So the first criteria . "
D,Elicit,"Do you all get what we're doing ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Okay comm cool . "
D,Task,"Okay comm first criteria comm look and feel . "
D,Elicit,"So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? "
D,Elicit,"As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? "
D,Elicit,"So what mark should we give for that ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I would give it a seven . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"As in it's not . "
C,Task,"Oh comm sorry comm one . "
A,Task,"Oh sorry comm one comm d yeah . "
B,Task,"A one . "
D,Other,"A one a one . "
D,Other,"So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . "
D,Task,"Second criteria comm new technology . "
D,Elicit,"Have we implemented new technology ? "
D,Minor,"As in the new high-tech "
B,Task,"Well comm the kinetic thing comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That was our main technological innovation "
C,Task,"w every everything else was fairly simple comm but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new . "
D,Minor,"So it's . "
A,Minor,". "
D,Minor,"So we'll give it a "
B,Minor,"Well so the um "
C,Task,"It's ergonomic comm "
C,Task,"but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but that's not a technological thing comm that's another thing comm i that's another marketing thing . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . True . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So on the technical side of it it "
D,Task,"I'd say it's about a a twoish ? "
C,Task,"It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere comm "
B,Task,"Two . "
D,Elicit,"Two . "
C,Task,"maybe comm yeah comm I dunno . "
D,Elicit,"Three . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Maybe three comm yeah . "
D,Task,"three . "
D,Elicit,"So criteria three is is it easy to use ? "
A,Task,"Easy to use . "
D,Task,"I think it's a one comm I think . "
A,Minor,"I'd say it's I wouldn't "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"not if you're left-handed it's not . "
A,Task,"I would give it a I would give it a two comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Two comm "
D,Minor,"so it's "
A,Task,"'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people comm but "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one comm but otherwise otherwise a two . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Give it a t give it a two . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"'Kay comm criteria four is costs . "
A,Task,"Cost . "
A,Task,"It's come in under budget . "
D,Task,"'s great . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So that's a definite one . "
C,Task,"That was great . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Amount of buttons . "
D,Task,"Like the amount of buttons comm "
D,Minor,"'cause people like a lot le like "
A,Task,"Contains only the necessary buttons . "
D,Elicit,"So it's a one ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um criteria six . "
D,Elicit,"R_S_I_ is it good against ? "
D,Task,"Yes . Very good . "
B,Task,"Yes s yeah . "
A,Task,"So it's anti-R_S_I_ . "
D,Task,"It's one . "
D,Task,"And criteria seven comm which is the last one comm "
D,Elicit,"does it get lost ? "
D,Elicit,"Is it easy to get lost ? "
B,Task,"It's yellow . "
A,Task,"I don't think it's gonna get lost easily . "
C,Task,"It is very bright comm yeah . "
D,Task,"No ? "
D,Task,"But it is smallish . "
C,Task,"It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something comm you know . "
B,Task,"Two . "
C,Task,"Maybe it will . Uh . "
B,Minor,"T "
D,Task,"Mm . I think i it would comm could be comm could get lost . "
C,Other,"You think it could lost "
D,Task,"Mm . Yeah . "
A,Task,"two . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say "
A,Minor,"I mean it "
A,Minor,"No comm I mean "
D,Task,"I mean comm it's not a one comm definitely . "
A,Task,"I mean comm you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically comm but "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm anything comm I mean . Okay . It's bigger than the average mobile comm I guess . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But comm yeah comm it can get lost . "
D,Task,"The mobiles get lost all the time . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay comm yeah comm two is fine . "
D,Task,"But then you ring 'em and you find them . So "
B,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . So comm that's that . "
D,Task,"So that's the evaluation comm "
D,Task,"so I'd say Yay . "
A,Task,"Alright it's all all systems go . "
D,Task,"It's like like a number one . Um . "
B,Task,"We've comm we've done well . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Number one product . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"All done comm thanks . "
A,Task,"We can't fail . "
D,Task,"We fitted all the criterias . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm so "
A,Minor,". "
A,Task,"Well done comm Reissa . "
D,Other,"So that's that one . "
A,Task,"Okay comm I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know comm little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it comm "
A,Task,"you know comm both individually and as a team . "
A,Task,"You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments comm "
A,Task,"um and then come together and worked in comm you know comm integrally comm you know comm at the right times comm "
A,Task,"psp comm you know comm especially you two . "
A,Task,"That's all comm you know comm gone very very well "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"and and "
A,Task,"and be you know comm has been good communication going on . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion comm "
C,Task,"but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and "
C,Minor,"just just "
A,Other,"Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ? "
B,Minor,"Well . "
C,Other,"We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and "
B,Other,"You know "
A,Task,"Fantastic . "
C,Task,"Now you guys have been a a great team . "
B,Minor,"It is . "
C,Other,"Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams comm . "
D,Task,"been cool . "
A,Task,"I think So "
A,Minor,"I I comm you know comm "
A,Task,"and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new comm something that hasn't been done before comm "
A,Task,"we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design . "
D,Minor,"In four diff "
D,Task,"in in four meetings . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Funny comm all designer meetings could be this quick . "
A,Other,"You know comm maybe this isn't a simulation comm "
A,Other,"maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just comm yeah comm they get "
C,Other,"Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote . "
D,Other,"They're using our ideas . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm two years' time this will be on the market . "
A,Other,"Ex exactly that product "
A,Minor,"um thum "
A,Other,"we'll go comm yeah comm we designed that and no-one will believe us . "
A,Minor,"But um "
C,Elicit,"So at this stage comm I mean comm is this the last meeting of the project ? "
C,Elicit,"We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"I think when this meeting's finished like officially comm there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . "
B,Minor,"Y "
B,Task,"Oh really ? "
A,Other,"Or six comm uh "
D,Task,"Just start summarising now . "
D,Task,"You can reply to the same message . "
A,Task,"I haven't got message . "
D,Task,"See summary comm there . If you just reply to that one . "
C,Minor,"So there's no way to like predict what our "
C,Minor,"'Cause we had a "
C,Task,"we originally had a As far as our financial uh um goals comm we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . "
C,Task,"It was fifty mil fifty million "
D,Elicit,"Was it was it fifty or five ? "
C,Task,"I don't remember . "
C,Task,"But there's not a way to compute that comm "
C,Elicit,"I mean comm since we saved on the on the production cost comm do we know how much we're making on profit ? "
A,Task,"It gets handed over to another department . "
D,Task,"Depends how much we sell . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"What our what our project was was to come up with the product comm basically . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"the for the "
A,Task,"and just basically is it it come can is it within budget . "
A,Task,"When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and comm you know comm the b the profits and all that that's other departments "
A,Task,"it's another team that actually work out the mai the "
C,Task,"But we have a vested interest "
A,Task,"oh yeah comm "
C,Task,"prof profit sharing . "
A,Task,"the all the guys in the profit sharing comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's it . "
A,Minor,"You know comm we've we've we've made i we've made "
D,Task,"We finished an hour earlier . "
A,Task,"we've designed the product comm "
A,Task,"we've ma we've got the prototype comm "
A,Task,"it's within budget comm "
A,Task,"it's does everything that we wanted it to do . "
A,Task,"It's new comm it's it's um "
A,Task,"something that uh that isn't out there already . "
C,Task,"I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh comm you know comm after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote comm you know . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"We're not we're not you know comm tying tying our cart to that one horse . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well comm this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that comm "
D,Minor,"Definitely . "
A,Minor,"it's that it's um comm "
A,Other,"hang on comm "
A,Task,"I wrote it down here somewhere "
A,Task,"Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . "
A,Task,"Um that comm you know comm it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury comm our one does the complete opposite comm you know comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"so that's something that's new comm "
A,Task,"which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"It make watching T_V_ healthy . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ comm you can f throw it about comm you know . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's fine comm it's kid proof . "
D,Task,"Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Other,"Well comm you can break the ornaments comm but you won't break that . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Yeah . So all in all comm I think we've done very well . "
B,Task,"Mm yep . "
A,Task,"Well done everybody . "
D,Other,"Yay . "
C,Task,"Right comm you too . "
A,Task,"Um . Drinks are on the company . "
B,Task,"Cool . "
A,Task,"In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Glad to hear that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's it . "
C,Task,"That's it . "
A,Task,"Well comm as far as I t as far as I know . Um . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Elicit,"We haven't got the five minute left thing yet . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"Anyone wanna play I spy ? "
D,Minor,"Mm mm . "
C,Task,"I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence . "
C,Elicit,"Should we call the day then ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I guess . "
A,Task,"I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire . "
C,Task,"Uh comm right . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"In project . "
A,Task,"But I'm not the authority to say that it is . "
A,Elicit,"Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? "
A,Elicit,"The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ? "
D,Task,"I love it . I love it . I think it's cool . "
D,Task,"Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool . "
D,Task,"Being watched . Um "
C,Other,"Your moment to shine . "
D,Other,"Wow . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I thi you know comm I'd I'd n yeah comm "
A,Task,"as we said earlier comm I've not never seen that before . "
A,Task,"something that t the whiteboard "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"thingy comm "
A,Task,"that's great . "
A,Task,"Um comm but a p a pen with a camera on it comm I don't think it's such a new thing . "
