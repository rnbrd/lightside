A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Well comm let's start . "
A,Other,"What are we doing ? "
A,Other,"Oops . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Other,"Ah comm pinball . "
A,Other,"Okay . Okay . Not doing . "
D,Other,"Mm . Ah . Hey . Ah . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Now I have my screen back too . "
A,Task,"Very good . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"we have presentations . "
A,Task,"So first comm it's your turn . "
B,Other,"Mine . Oh comm great . "
A,Other,"Yeah . Isn't it amazing . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Very interesting . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
A,Other,"Industrial Designer . "
A,Other,"Interface concept . "
B,Minor,"Yes comm well uh "
B,Other,"let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . "
B,Other,"Uh comm first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose comm "
B,Other,"uh show you some samples comm uh "
B,Other,"uh discuss some colours and design maybe comm already . "
B,Other,"And uh my personal preferences . "
B,Task,"Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . "
B,Minor,"The bu uh "
B,Task,"the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . "
B,Task,"The channels buttons comm one to nine comm "
B,Minor,"and uh off uh uh "
B,Task,"zero to nine comm "
B,Task,"and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . "
B,Task,"Uh the volume and channel quadrants comm "
B,Task,"uh left and right comm up and down arrows comm to uh do the volume and channel . "
B,Task,"And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . "
B,Task,"Um comm I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples . "
B,Task,"Um comm well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh "
D,Task,"Large . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"A lot a lot of buttons buttons . "
B,Task,"Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . "
B,Task,"Um comm power buttons are mostly at the top "
B,Task,"uh left or right . "
B,Task,"Um comm well we see the the the same uh arrows . "
B,Task,"Like there . "
B,Minor,"And uh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm well arrow b buttons can be blue . "
B,Task,"And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . "
B,Task,"Some buttons have icons like the play and stop comm "
B,Task,"but we don't use that . "
B,Task,"But uh comm these we we have to choose the right icons comm or or letters . "
B,Task,"Uh this is the V_ for volume comm but they're both uh a V_ . "
B,Task,"So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"Yeah . So comm that's "
A,Task,"Can you go back one page ? "
A,Elicit,"For the uh menu comm what do we use for that ? "
B,Minor,"Uh comm well "
A,Task,"We don't have buttons for the menu . "
A,Task,"Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I thought that was our uh idea . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So comm uh how "
A,Minor,"But uh "
A,Task,"You have to put it on the "
B,Task,"Like this . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or or this . "
B,Task,"And that the menu button is okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah but comm has to be clear that you can use the arrows . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Elicit,"Uh comm so the "
B,Elicit,"The icons on the arrows comm as well comm you mean . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh comm well that's something to uh think about . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh comm maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . "
C,Task,"And you will see it . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Um comm well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already comm or in the next uh meeting . "
B,Task,"But uh comm as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo comm I would uh recommend a yellow case . "
B,Task,"Uh comm round edges . "
B,Task,"The logo at the bottom . "
B,Task,"And uh comm well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . "
B,Task,"So comm it's good . "
B,Task,"Uh comm recognisable . "
B,Task,"K so comm I think . "
A,Task,"Not too much colours . "
B,Task,"Uh comm no . Not too much . "
B,Minor,"But uh "
A,Task,"No comm it's not flower power . "
B,Task,"No comm no comm no . "
B,Task,"But this has to be has to be trendy "
B,Minor,"and uh and "
A,Task,"S okay . "
B,Task,"Uh comm yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons comm and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"That was that . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Task,"So comm you're next . "
C,Other,"I'm next comm okay . "
C,Other,"Yes . No . "
C,Other,"Here we go . "
C,Other,"Uh comm at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . "
C,Other,"And then comm I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs comm about uh what battery is in it comm what kind of buttons also . "
C,Task,"First uh comm the younger people comm they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . "
C,Task,"Like comm totally yellow comm totally red . "
C,Task,"Uh comm so it's visible . "
C,Task,"Uh comm the shapes are curved and round comm "
C,Task,"like uh you also said . "
C,Task,"Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones comm straight and uh flat and long . "
C,Task,"But to give him the shape of your hand comm so you it's easier to use or something like that . "
C,Task,"But that's just an idea . "
C,Other,"And then comm I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . "
C,Task,"The battery comm there are few options . "
C,Task,"Uh comm I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . "
C,Task,"So comm everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . "
C,Task,"Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . "
C,Task,"When you uh shake it a few times comm it it's loaded . "
C,Task,"Uh comm the the form of the remote control comm I think it's also nice have it curved . "
C,Task,"And maybe like it's hand-shaped . "
C,Task,"Uh comm so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . "
C,Task,"Uh material comm you use plastic . Hard plastic "
C,Task,"uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time . "
C,Task,"And also rubber "
C,Task,"because the younger people like that comm "
C,Task,"what we see in the research . "
C,Task,"Uh the push-buttons . "
C,Task,"We have one new thing uh discovered . "
C,Task,"It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . "
C,Task,"Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . "
C,Task,"When you want to go m move up comm you just scroll up "
C,Task,"and click on the button comm if you wanna see the next comm uh if you wanna see that channel . "
C,Task,"And also for the mouse comm uh for the volume comm it's also uh easy to use . "
C,Task,"Just scroll a bit up comm scroll a bit down . "
C,Task,"And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this comm and you get it here . "
C,Task,"You can do it with your thumb . "
C,Task,"And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"uh if you push uh channel one comm you can see channel one . "
C,Task,"The electrics um with a scroll push uh button comm we must use regular uh chips . "
C,Task,"There are also uh simple chips . "
C,Task,"They are uh cheaper . "
C,Task,"Um comm but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control comm "
C,Task,"and I think there are a lot of those uh things comm and people won't buy it any more . "
C,Task,"They have seen enough of it . "
C,Task,"And you have also advanced um chips . "
C,Task,"But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . "
C,Task,"And the costs will increase a lot more . "
C,Task,"And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ comm "
C,Task,"and the chip who is more expensive . "
C,Task,"And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control comm "
C,Task,"that we then use the primary colours . "
C,Task,"Like comm you get a yellow uh remote control comm red one comm blue one comm et cetera . "
C,Elicit,"You have any more questions about this ? "
C,Task,"I think the main thing is we look at the costs . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"And not too basic comm "
C,Task,"not a basic remote control comm who everybody already has . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"But comm thi i uh "
D,Elicit,"This is with an L_C_D_ ? No comm "
C,Task,"Not with an L_C_D_ . "
D,Other,"not . "
A,Elicit,"No comm isn't . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . "
A,Task,"Then you can scroll comm you see what number comm and then you push . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But then comm what I say comm the costs will uh get a lot higher . "
A,Task,"But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . "
C,Task,"Th then you'll see it on the television . "
A,Minor,"If you don't "
A,Task,"Hmm comm yes . But then . Yeah comm then you go one down one up . "
A,Task,"When you scroll . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"but l when you see a menu uh on the television comm it's like you see uh one to twenty comm you go uh uh s scroll up comm and push number tw twenty . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"but like we said before comm it has to be used on every television . "
A,Minor,"So you may not be uh "
A,Other,"No . "
A,Task,"The television must do that . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think the younger people will have newer televisions comm which can provide our uh remote control . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"but young people have to have all their uh room . "
A,Task,"And mostly they are smaller . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"But that won't be a problem . I think . "
A,Task,"Most the times that are not advanced televisions . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . "
C,Task,"And I think comm what I said comm everybody has them uh has them already . "
C,Task,"And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . "
C,Task,"Uh comm and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . "
C,Task,"And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Uh comm can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? "
C,Task,"I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . "
C,Task,"But I don't know uh how much higher . "
D,Minor,"'Cause it "
D,Task,"I think if we have an L_C_D_ comm it will also sell a lot better . "
A,Task,"That's important . "
C,Task,"That's true . "
D,Task,"And that might uh bring back the costs uh "
C,Minor,"But then we'll "
C,Task,"I think we must discuss who uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control comm or better options on it . "
C,Elicit,"With a scroll menu comm a w scroll thing comm and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . "
C,Elicit,"Or comm a more hand-shaped remote control comm with scroll comm without L_C_D_ . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . "
C,Other,"I can uh look on my uh "
A,Task,"It's very important . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . "
C,Task,"A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip comm which is a higher price range . "
C,Task,"The display requires a advanced chip comm which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm more expensive . "
A,Elicit,"But how much ? "
C,Task,"Doesn't say . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"Huh . "
B,Other,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"That's from my manufacturing division . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Other,"Well comm thank you . "
D,Elicit,"My turn ? "
C,Task,"Yes ? "
A,Task,"Next . "
D,Minor,"Mm . So "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So comm my uh presentation is about trend-watching . "
D,Task,"Uh comm I did some trend-watching . "
D,Task,"It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . 'Cause if you don't comm you won't sell . "
D,Task,"So comm well how we did do that ? "
D,Task,"Uh comm well we made an investigation of the market comm by Trendwatchers . "
D,Task,"They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . "
D,Task,"Of course comm well known for their uh trend uh trends . "
D,Task,"And well comm uh what did you find ? "
D,Task,"Uh comm we have two groups comm young and trendy comm and the old and rich . "
D,Task,"Well th and the young and trendy comm they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes comm shoes comm and also uh products . "
D,Task,"And um comm material ? That should feel have uh a spongy feeling . "
D,Task,"And to get a feeling for what it is comm uh here is an image of it . "
D,Task,"Then the old and rich . "
D,Task,"They like uh dark colours comm and simple comm recognisable shapes . "
D,Task,"And um comm they also like uh familiar material comm uh especially wood . "
D,Task,"Now comm another picture . "
D,Task,"To get a feeling for this . "
D,Task,"Well comm uh then already come to my personal preferences . "
D,Task,"We uh aim at the younger market . "
D,Task,"So comm we should also be uh look at their uh trends . "
D,Task,"However comm with trends it's always if there's it's now . "
D,Task,"It it it might last one year comm and next year it be uh can be totally different . "
D,Task,"And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . "
D,Task,"So comm we m must not just only look at what the trend is now comm "
D,Task,"as it might be totally different next year . "
D,Task,"So comm that's uh one thing to keep in mind . "
C,Task,"Changing covers . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Any questions ? "
C,Task,"Nope . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No . It's clear . "
A,Minor,"So now comm it's uh "
A,Other,"Ah comm let's see . "
A,Minor,"Now comm w we have to decide "
A,Task,"Well comm we have to decide on the concept . "
A,Task,"So comm we have to look at 'S next . Components and user interface concept . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Now comm we have to make some concept . "
A,Task,"Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . "
A,Task,"First comm uh user interface . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm uh-uh . "
C,Elicit,"How w how we how we make it ? Uh "
A,Minor,"Yes comm a concept on uh "
C,Task,"Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all "
A,Minor,"Just "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but maybe we can paint it . Uh comm what do we want ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but if I paint with "
A,Other,"I'll paint . Okay . "
A,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Something like this ? Or "
B,Task,"Mm comm yes . "
A,Elicit,"Shapes or What do we need ? "
D,Task,"Can make several uh concepts . "
B,Other,"What ? "
A,Task,"Yes comm okay . "
D,Task,"We have this comm and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"More like something "
D,Task,"Yeah I I I uh yes . "
C,Minor,"M like "
C,Task,"Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"And you have to . "
C,Other,"I have to . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I'm not a designer . "
C,Task,"It's more three D_ . "
C,Task,"Like comm um when you have "
C,Task,"a part here . "
C,Task,"This is the remote control . "
C,Task,"And then you have something like th this under it . "
C,Task,"So comm it's easier to get it like this . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's like a gun . "
D,Minor,"A g "
A,Elicit,"So comm it has to be soft ? "
D,Minor,"Mm . . "
C,Task,"And it has to be soft comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So comm you can squeeze in it and "
A,Elicit,"And uh comm the buttons ? "
C,Other,"Sorry ? "
A,Task,"Buttons . "
C,Task,"Buttons on top of it . "
C,Task,"And here . "
C,Task,"The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb . "
B,Elicit,"But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ? "
C,Task,"But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . "
A,Minor,"No comm it won't . "
C,Task,"One till uh uh zero till nine . "
A,Task,"But comm well there one for the sound and one for the channels . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Minor,"But but how "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And the b "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Minor,"How "
C,Task,"Or two buttons . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"And i if we go to uh "
A,Task,"Uh comm two scroll uh wheels . "
C,Minor,"If uh "
C,Minor,"'Kay c If we do "
C,Task,"If we use one comm then we'll have just a switch on it comm "
C,Task,"and you'll just switch it comm "
C,Task,"and now it's the sound to switch back "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"That's th that's more difficult . "
D,Minor,"But if we have uh a me Yeah . "
A,Minor,"It's better in "
D,Elicit,"If we have a menu comm uh how do we uh choose other options ? "
C,Task,"with the menu uh button . "
C,Task,"And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . "
C,Task,"Just not like all the other ones comm with uh this thing comm and uh here an arrow comm here an arrow comm here an arrow comm here an arrow . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Because uh comm from h hundred uh remote controls comm ninety nine have it . "
A,Task,"But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh comm then we have it on the T_V_ comm the menu . "
D,Minor,"Uh-uh . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah comm but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? "
A,Task,"You don't know . "
A,Task,"So comm there's no menu . "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
C,Task,"It's like some sort of uh teletext option comm but we don't have teletext . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"So you can't use it . "
C,Task,"And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it comm then the costs will uh be much higher . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we make two concepts . "
A,Task,"One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"'Kay . "
C,Elicit,"But you all like this kind of thing . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Good concept . "
A,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"With the scroll button . "
A,Task,"That's one . "
C,Task,"And and this one has to be soft . "
D,Minor,"Uh-uh . "
C,Task,"And this has to be harder comm "
C,Task,"because when it falls comm it mu mu must not burst . "
C,Task,"Or some kind of rubber around it . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"It's one . "
A,Elicit,"Two . Number two . "
B,Task,"And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . "
B,Minor,"Like uh "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Ah that's nice . "
C,Task,"Here . Trigger . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"Just to uh "
A,Task,"But when you handle it comm you put it on and off . "
A,Task,"It's not good to use . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm like a "
A,Other,"Yeah comm but I'll zap . "
A,Other,"Fuck . Out . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No comm it's not good . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Now comm second concept . "
A,Task,"One with L_C_D_ comm one without L_C_D_ . "
A,Minor,"Then uh "
A,Task,"Paint it . "
C,Other,"Paint it ? "
C,Elicit,"With the scroll thing on comm like this ? "
A,Task,"One with two scroll buttons and one with without . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh comm one with a with a menu comm and one without a menu . "
C,Minor,"So ? "
A,Task,"And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"Draw it . "
A,Other,"Unbelievable . "
A,Other,"Do I have to do everything . "
A,Other,"Blank . "
A,Minor,"You have "
A,Task,"Not so difficult . "
B,Elicit,"But if you put push the the menu button "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh comm that's the menu . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm wh what "
A,Task,"There for the L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Task,"Yes comm but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . "
A,Minor,"You have to "
A,Elicit,"For the menu . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"One that way . "
A,Task,"And one that way . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Then it depends on the cost . "
A,Task,"S On and off . "
C,Elicit,"But is it easy to use ? "
C,Task,"When you have it on your left side comm "
C,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"When it's not too big . "
A,Task,"Just like a a phone . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"M uh yeah comm maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um "
C,Task,"Separate comm more separate comm h yeah . "
D,Task,"more separate comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yes comm okay . "
D,Task,"Like comm you have the menu button in between uh "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"On the left a scroll button comm and on the right a scroll button . "
C,Elicit,"But would it be easy to use then ? "
C,Minor,"If it's like you have a big uh "
A,Task,"Very good . "
A,Elicit,"Is it better ? "
A,Task,"When you uh the menu comm you have to go there there there there . "
C,Task,"I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"They were like round curves comm "
C,Minor,"uh different uh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . That's that's the outside . "
C,Task,"Okay comm okay comm okay . "
A,Minor,"But now the "
A,Task,"First the buttons . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Think we have we have now two buttons missing . "
D,Minor,"The uh um "
D,Task,"The mute button . "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
D,Task,"We have two buttons missing . "
D,Task,"The mute button . "
D,Task,"And um comm the to to uh have to uh numbers "
A,Task,"Mute . And the other . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Not so difficult . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"But comm uh "
C,Task,"Personally comm I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle . "
A,Elicit,"But how do you wanna solve it ? "
C,Task,"With the switch button . "
A,Task,"Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy . "
A,Task,"Then you go down comm you switch comm you go into the right comm you switch comm you go down . "
C,Task,"No "
C,Minor,"like uh "
C,Other,"Oh comm you mean like that . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh comm then you can also have like uh th um "
A,Task,"A joystick . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm and joystick comm I think . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"But is it uh "
A,Elicit,"Does that break comm a joystick ? "
A,Task,"Or a small one just like in a laptop . "
C,Task,"Yeah like in a laptop comm s uh s some sort of thing . "
C,Task,"A little bit bigger comm "
C,Minor,"with easier thi "
A,Task,"Mean comm it's better . "
A,Elicit,"But how expensive it is ? "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Other,"Oh . Why do I pay you for ? "
A,Minor,"Um comm well um "
A,Elicit,"Better ideas . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Or no scroll uh things . "
C,Task,"Just a shape . "
C,Minor,"And "
C,Task,"No comm no . It won't work . "
A,Task,"For the young peoples I think scroll button's good . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Uh-huh . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Think we have to keep them . "
C,Task,"Or a remote control more like joystick . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but is it "
A,Task,"That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better . "
A,Task,"A small one . "
C,Task,"A small one like this comm like a Nintendo uh k "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"just like in a "
C,Task,"Playstation thing . "
A,Task,"a laptop . "
A,Task,"Small comm round . "
A,Task,"Then it's not so big . "
C,Task,"No comm no comm no . "
C,Task,"I mean the the shape of the remote control . "
A,Minor,"Oh the sh "
C,Task,"Just like a Playstation thing . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but then you can "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Maybe comm if it's possible comm it's not too expensive comm I think a joystick is better . "
A,Task,"A small one . "
A,Task,"So comm please look at it . "
C,Task,"No comm that's okay comm "
C,Minor,"I got "
D,Elicit,"And on the L_C_D_ comm how much it costs ? "
D,Elicit,"Uh comm it costs extra ? "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"they're not uh in details . "
C,Task,"It's more expensive or less expensive comm huh ? "
A,Task,"Yeah we I think you get it . "
A,Task,"So comm after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it . "
C,Other,"Then I have to come with it . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"I got my personal costs . "
C,Task,"I I don't I don't know the costs . "
A,Other,"Your problem . Not mine . "
C,Other,"Then I'll uh make something up . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So comm do we have other concepts ? "
A,Task,"Then for the components comm we use a normal battery . "
B,Task,"Mm comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Then it's Ch cheapest way comm I think . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . "
A,Task,"No comm no kinetic . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm I think it's uh comm yeah comm "
A,Task,"Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . "
C,Task,"more expensive . Yeah . "
A,Task,"So we use a normal battery . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"Depends on the scroll . "
A,Task,"Scroll . "
C,Task,"If we use a scroll comm then we have the uh regular chip . "
C,Task,"If we don't use a scroll comm then we can use the simple chip . "
C,Minor,"And that's "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And uh comm we If you use the L_C_D_ comm we have to "
C,Task,"Uh the most expensive . "
A,Task,"Yes comm okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So comm depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . "
C,Minor,"If we "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"If we "
C,Other,"No okay scroll-wheel . "
C,Task,"So comm I have this . "
C,Task,"So comm it will be uh the advanced chip comm or the uh regu uh or the regular chip . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So comm uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ "
A,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"But comm it has to be small . "
A,Task,"I think . "
C,Task,"Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? "
C,Task,"And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ? "
A,Task,"If you have pistol comm it L_C_D_'s not easy . "
A,Minor,"Y y Yeah but "
C,Task,"Just use your thumb . "
A,Task,"If you use a phone . "
C,Minor,"If you "
C,Task,"Yeah . I use my thumb . "
A,Minor,"k Yeah comm but but then you have it . "
A,Task,"Like comm th if you have pistol comm you have it so . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"And the screen is "
A,Task,"Well comm then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen . "
C,Minor,"If you have a joystick on "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And you move up comm f forward comm down comm left . "
C,Task,"Then you have uh just comm yeah comm a little bit curved . "
C,Task,"It's not just uh straight . "
A,Task,"No . No comm no . "
C,Task,"That's how we use it . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"That's why they make joysticks like that comm I think . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but then you look forward . "
D,Minor,"Uh comm yeah comm but "
A,Task,"And then you can y "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"N well comm if you have to look at it . "
D,Minor,"If you "
C,Task,"'Kay . Here's our designer . "
D,Task,"If we have uh then something standing here comm with the L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Then it goes like this . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm why not . "
A,Minor,"If th n well "
C,Task,"It's for the younger people . "
A,Task,"Yes comm of course . "
C,Task,"It's something new . "
B,Minor,"It's uh "
A,Task,"That's good good . "
A,Minor,"But the um comm "
A,Task,"it may not break . "
C,Task,"Now we put uh rubber around it . "
A,Task,"Okay . If that's possible . "
D,Task,"Um comm Yeah . "
C,Task,"Hard plastic comm uh the shape comm and around it hard uh around it rubber . "
C,Task,"And the uh the hand shape is also rubber . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Or you can uh turn it inside . "
D,Minor,"I can't see the . "
D,Minor,"But comm uh the easy of "
B,Minor,"But that's "
D,Task,"uh comm th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Task,"No comm that's true . "
D,Task,"Uh comm for us it's about to sell it . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Yeah of course . "
C,Task,"This is something new . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Then this is the design . "
A,Task,"And the buttons are on the next page . "
A,Task,"So comm depends on the cost . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"Costs are okay . "
A,Task,"um we have one minute . "
B,Minor,". "
D,Elicit,"One . "
A,Task,"I think . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"No . "
D,Task,"You have more . "
A,Elicit,"More . Seven . "
D,Task,"You have still ten . "
A,Task,"Next meeting . Thirty minutes . "
A,Task,"So hurry up . "
C,Task,"Oh comm that's us together . "
A,Task,"You two stay here . "
A,Task,"Paint it . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Now you have to . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I think it's clear . "
A,Task,"Check your mail . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"It has to be ready in the next meeting . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Other,"What ? "
B,Other,"Cookie . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Next meeting is called the detailed design . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Everyth everything has to be ready . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Thanks for your attention . "
C,Task,"'Kay . "
D,Other,"See you at the next meeting . "
C,Other,"Bye bye . "
