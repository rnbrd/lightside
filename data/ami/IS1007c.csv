Speaker,DialogAct,Text
A,Other,"So we come to the third meetings . "
A,Minor,"I have "
A,Task,"good . "
A,Task,"Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design "
A,Task,"and now we will talk about the conceptual design . "
A,Task,"So we will talk about some specific details . "
C,Other,"Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept "
C,Task,"so can you please uh open uh "
C,Task,"I'm participant two . "
C,Task,"Components design . "
A,Minor,"This "
C,Minor,"Okay so uh "
C,Task,"the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department "
C,Task,"and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . "
C,Task,"So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy comm hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy . "
C,Task,"We also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . "
A,Task,"Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . "
C,Minor,"Now "
A,Task,"But if we use battery "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source "
C,Minor,"but uh I didn't fou "
C,Task,"we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . "
C,Task,"So uh it's a point to discuss . "
C,Task,"Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices comm like wood comm rubber comm titanium or latex . "
C,Task,"But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the from the technical uh point of view . "
C,Task,"Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated comm "
C,Task,"but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"And uh this is the last point comm the choice of chips . "
C,Task,"So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy "
C,Task,"because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered uh uh environment . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So um so I think we can start with these two main things . "
C,Task,"For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice "
C,Task,"because it's trendy "
C,Task,"and it's uh it's uh well it's modern "
C,Task,"and uh user are are are mm will be uh very happy to have a a a nice remote . "
C,Task,"For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons comm simple buttons "
C,Task,"and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are uh well cheaper . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"And s so uh we can move to the next slide . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"What is this single curved "
B,Elicit,"what does it mean ? "
C,Task,"Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote . "
B,Minor,"So it's it's not "
C,Task,"You you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the "
B,Minor,"Yo l yeah . "
B,Task,"When you hold on it comm it is comfortable to hold . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"And the battery comm is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? "
C,Task,"Yeah the um that's the point . "
C,Task,"The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um "
B,Task,"That that's what it means by kinetic . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible "
C,Task,"because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And yeah and "
C,Task,"so can you go to the next slide please . "
C,Task,"So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said . "
B,Minor,"Mm mm . Wha "
C,Task,"So uh you're right "
C,Task,"we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . "
B,Task,"Ah the department . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"That's it . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
B,Elicit,"So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department . "
C,Task,"Oh yeah "
C,Task,"I take care comm "
C,Task,"it's all right . "
B,Task,"So the titanium case is the normal case that "
B,Other,"I'll show you some pictures that I have "
B,Elicit,"and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not . "
C,Other,"All right . Yeah . "
B,Task,"'Cause I am not very sure comm plastic comm titanium or whatever . "
B,Other,"There's another point I want to make comm "
B,Task,"is that the uh well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can use "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"maybe n "
A,Other,"We will comm okay . "
A,Task,"Three . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system comm "
B,Task,"a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user "
B,Task,"and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . "
B,Task,"So you s this gives you the ways to input data "
B,Minor,"and we have uh we are more "
B,Task,"we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . "
B,Task,"The idea is to represent buttons as figures comm diagrams comm symbols and on "
B,Task,"so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . "
A,Task,"What's the function of this button . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . So . "
A,Task,"I think it makes the the interface really "
B,Task,"Ea easy to use . "
B,Task,"So next one . "
A,Other,"Graphical user interface . "
B,Minor,"function five . "
B,Other,"So I can use the button comm the mouse maybe . "
A,Task,"A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So next line . "
B,Task,"So the here are some examples . "
B,Task,"So they cluster the buttons together . "
B,Task,"They group them into col they colour them "
B,Task,"and uh they have different forms as well . "
B,Minor,"Mm "
B,Task,"but this interface are kind of confusing . "
B,Task,"Uh basically there are too many buttons . "
B,Task,"Right . Next one . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So some people are propose voice recognition "
B,Minor,"and so "
B,Task,"ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company "
B,Task,"when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine "
B,Task,"and the machine are reply to you . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm mm mm . "
B,Task,"So I just got an email saying that . "
B,Task,"And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used "
B,Task,"so we might consider that comm supposedly . "
C,Task,"Yeah fine . "
B,Task,"The next one . "
B,Task,"Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display "
B,Task,"so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen "
B,Task,"and then there you can u you can use that as buttons comm "
B,Task,"you can use that as real "
B,Task,"so so that could be an option as well . "
B,Task,"Touch screen comm I mean . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Next one . "
B,Task,"And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons "
B,Task,"or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . "
B,Task,"Like the one we have here . "
B,Task,"Uh comm next one . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"mm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"so there are a few aspects that I collected here . "
B,Task,"So s basically this deals with special users comm children comm handicapped people comm old people comm "
B,Minor,"and uh mm and prog "
B,Task,"basically they are programmable comm "
B,Task,"specially for children . "
B,Minor,"And uh mm yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"And then they also secure uh covers comm to protect "
B,Task,"uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . "
B,Task,"I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so that's the point . "
B,Task,"The next one . "
B,Task,"And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . "
B,Task,"Mm maybe useful for children comm "
B,Task,"they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . "
B,Task,"And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . "
B,Task,"So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"S a good idea . "
B,Task,"The next one . "
B,Minor,"So this guy "
B,Task,"this is another company that provides big buttons . "
B,Minor,"At "
B,Task,"I see that that is useful for old people "
B,Task,"and then you don't get it lost . "
B,Task,"But for our product we don't need a big one "
B,Task,"because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is . "
B,Other,"T_V_ remote controller where are you ? "
B,Task,"And then comm he will beeps and to say that I am here comm for example . "
B,Elicit,"Is it possible ? "
A,Task,"We should include speech synthesis in this case comm no ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Uh ? "
C,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And uh comm this is another one "
B,Minor,"where you can uh "
B,Task,"the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . "
B,Task,"So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . "
B,Task,"But you the see that in the V_ comm the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top "
B,Minor,"on the top up arrow if you "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down "
B,Task,"so it's confusing interface comm "
B,Task,"so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design . "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"And here are is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . "
B,Task,"Big buttons are convenient comm "
B,Task,"voice recognition helps comm "
B,Task,"push buttons comm scroll buttons comm spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . "
B,Task,"And uh user customisable is important "
B,Task,"and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . So "
B,Task,"we have many concepts there "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"And basically uh "
C,Task,"Well I I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also comm so . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control "
A,Task,"and we should have just a button like help "
A,Task,"and you say uh and you ik you press the button help "
A,Task,"and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ . "
C,Task,"Yeah . That's a good idea . "
C,Task,"To have a help button . "
B,Other,"A help button . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"So you are display on the screen . "
C,Task,"On the T_V_ screen . "
A,Task,"On T_V_ T_V_ screen . "
B,Other,"So on the T_V_ screen . "
C,Task,"On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote . "
A,Task,"So just you push the button "
B,Minor,"Okay . Okay . Okay . "
A,Minor,"and we will "
D,Minor,"Oh . "
B,Task,"So that eliminates all the complicated documentation comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"okay . "
B,Minor,"So wi "
D,Task,"But people are often enough looking at the help comm "
D,Task,"once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . "
A,Minor,"If the if "
A,Task,"No "
A,Minor,"In the case where they need help comm in the case where they need help . "
C,Task,"Uh yeah . "
D,Task,"It's a psychology . "
C,Task,"In a marketing point of view . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And let us see what the market demands . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"We could just go to my presentation . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"But uh wel well I think "
A,Task,"It's just for user customizable comm for kids or old people . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's right . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"and if you remove the "
A,Task,"So it's the same "
D,Task,"Same remote with some "
A,Task,"Can be used by both kids and old people . "
D,Task,"Both yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller comm i it could be a cube comm "
B,Task,"is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube "
B,Task,"and maybe you can just change the um the buttons comm "
B,Task,"if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons comm "
B,Task,"you turn the other side you get the other buttons comm "
B,Task,"so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls . "
A,Task,"Maybe for kids comm "
A,Minor,"kids they like uh t no l they like to "
B,Minor,"Small "
C,Minor,"Uh well . "
C,Task,"So le le let's see what uh what people want . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Let's see the market demand . "
D,Task,"And then we can decide what what we can yeah . "
B,Minor,"What what market yes yes . "
D,Task,"So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes "
D,Task,"and how it could be special from the other remotes . "
D,Task,"And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . "
D,Task,"Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . "
D,Task,"And we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design . "
D,Task,"So seventy percent of the users comm they find their remote controls very ugly comm "
D,Task,"they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . "
D,Task,"And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . "
D,Task,"And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . "
D,Task,"And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . "
D,Task,"And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yes . "
D,Task,"So this were the findings which we found . "
D,Task,"And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . "
D,Minor,"Most of "
D,Task,"fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room "
D,Task,"and people are always searching for them rather than watching the T_V_ . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished . "
D,Task,"So they're frustrated a lot "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Mm comm the functionalities yeah . "
D,Task,"So you can just see the percentage comm "
D,Task,"fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes "
D,Task,"and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . "
D,Elicit,"We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen . "
B,Task,"Big screen . "
C,Minor,"It's "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm ? "
C,Task,"yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on "
C,Task,"but it's it's expensive to produce "
C,Minor,"and it's not really "
D,Task,"I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote comm rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . "
D,Task,"It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control . "
B,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . The thing "
D,Task,"We just play around "
C,Task,"Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have a big screen in front of you comm s "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You can use this screen instead of the big se screen comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"If you re-use the existing screen comm we element eliminate the L_C_D_ comm "
A,Minor,"instead of use the yeah . "
B,Task,"after all the L_C_D_ just to display "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful comm fancy comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"maybe even better . "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So I th I I "
C,Task,"well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look "
C,Minor,"on the uh "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"More on a fancy design . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's fine . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"on the speech recognition if the technology is available "
D,Minor,"I mean that's "
C,Task,"but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . So i is "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah we have uh "
B,Task,"so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost "
B,Task,"and then we'll decide again . "
D,Task,"I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers . "
B,Task,"Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time . "
C,Other,"So price of uh L_C_D_ display . "
B,Minor,"Is i if i "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . "
C,Minor,"And "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And also the cost for the speech recognition . "
A,Minor,"Mm . It's for "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Ask our R_ and D_ department . "
A,Task,"it's just for small vocabulary . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary comm "
A,Minor,"We it's not "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"say eighty commands or so . "
B,Minor,"And ho "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah okay . "
B,Task,"And also the scroller button comm how much will it cost . "
C,Minor,"And "
C,Elicit,"Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Push push . "
D,Task,"Mm comm the scroll button comm "
D,Task,"from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah I think that "
D,Task,"Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button "
B,Task,"Don't use the buttons . "
C,Task,"so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important . "
B,Task,"Important . "
C,Task,"Yeah . But "
A,Task,"But they are just less used compar "
D,Task,"They're not used much . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen "
C,Task,"like uh a a list of function "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Mm . "
C,Task,"and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"and you "
B,Task,"So so the at most more power uh . "
A,Task,"Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So . "
C,Task,"But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen I think that just five buttons are sufficient comm "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"one to go up left right down and uh enter "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Mm . Yeah . "
C,Task,"You don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Or it could be like this comm as the people say comm if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . "
D,Task,"Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background comm "
D,Task,"we are most focused on the commands . "
D,Task,"So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote comm you just have a menu comm "
C,Task,"Yeah but "
D,Task,"and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs "
D,Task,"and this menu when you press the menu comm in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume comm then the program comm then the brightness comm contrast and all the stuff . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And accordingly you can just increase or decrease . "
C,Task,"Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"It's "
C,Task,"so i i it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at comm so . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"I if "
B,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"that has to be checked out . "
B,Task,"I think that there's no contradiction here comm "
B,Task,"because if there are few buttons comm you don't have to look at your your controller any more "
B,Task,"because you know where the buttons are comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness "
B,Task,"and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button "
B,Task,"and the same for the volume and the channel comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel comm "
B,Task,"just tell your channel "
B,Task,"and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller "
B,Task,"so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"with the help of speech recogniser you can "
D,Task,"I mean comm better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and also with the speech recognition . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Mm . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"A and "
D,Task,"And the third problem was to find the remote control . "
D,Task,"Always comm so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes . "
C,Task,"Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t "
B,Task,"Where comm "
A,Task,"You will listen to a peep comm special peep . "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's right comm "
D,Task,"that's exactly what I mean by voice commander . "
D,Task,"Or it could be also something like this comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so we have some one charger there "
D,Task,"and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . "
B,Task,"Put it back at the charge . "
C,Minor,"Put "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere comm in the charger we have a small button comm and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps comm wherever it is . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And that's a good idea comm "
C,Task,"that's simple comm like in phones . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command comm "
D,Task,"because there are problems with a voice command . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But you don't you don't have to move the the charger . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . Mm . Th yeah . Mm yeah . Yeah . Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"I mean charger would be fixed "
A,Minor,"You have to keep it . "
D,Task,"because it's always with electricity plugged . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery . Also and uh uh the remote is lost . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm . There's mm . Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's right . "
B,Minor,"That we can "
B,Task,"what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button comm the off button comm the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen comm please charge charge me . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You never get it lost "
B,Task,"because uh every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger . "
D,Task,"It's an good reminder comm "
D,Task,"yeah that's right . "
B,Task,"Yeah . So you will never get lost yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Maybe for some people lazy people . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah "
B,Task,"because everything is programmed inside . "
A,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"So it's it's uh it's all about strategy comm y "
D,Task,"And of course the final point is a fancy look . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"They were ugly . "
D,Task,"I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons . "
C,Minor,"They "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"I think we should have something it "
C,Task,"Well the last one with the um yeah with the two parts was uh original comm so "
B,Task,"With uh two two two parts controller . "
D,Task,"I mean uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it comm you can't avoid him . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But you can have an button for child lock . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So just by pressing the button with some code comm you t you put a lock onto the remote comm so that he can't use even "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
C,Task,"Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category comm if it is kids comm uh things like that . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm uh "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Or "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Mm . "
D,Task,"That's right . "
A,Task,"Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids "
A,Task,"and then just just yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"these are probl "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,". "
A,Minor,"So if he . "
D,Task,"I think these other four points they're the market demands "
D,Task,"and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think "
C,Minor,"So for mm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Other,"So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use comm where to use comm and s uh and so on . "
D,Task,"Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs comm you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . "
B,Task,"If numbers comm they're easy comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but if name the channel by by name "
C,Task,"Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels "
C,Task,"and you can say to your remote control like uh sports "
C,Task,"and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"and and uh "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"we have a problem there . "
D,Task,"You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something comm and if the score comes twenty four thirty five comm you've just say twenty five "
D,Task,"and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five . "
A,Minor,"Yeah it's yeah . "
D,Task,"So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers "
C,Task,"That's right comm yeah comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I mean the the you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent "
C,Minor,"Yeah but well "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"okay . "
D,Task,"and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So it's better to have some prefix before the number . "
B,Task,"But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . "
D,Task,"Yeah something comm some code . "
B,Task,"You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel . "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"So some people may want to say comm I want to see this channel . "
C,Minor,"Mm mm . "
C,Minor,"Well I "
D,Task,"That will be too big . "
D,Task,"And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . "
A,Minor,"Or just "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser . "
A,Task,"It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . "
B,Other,"Uh ? "
A,Task,"It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . "
A,Minor,"Because you have to s t uh a ch "
B,Task,"Well comm it's convenient for the user . "
A,Task,"yeah "
A,Task,"but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . "
D,Task,"Als might be you just forgot the channel name comm you kno only know the number . "
A,Minor,"Or maybe "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Then "
B,Minor,"The uh uh mm . "
A,Task,"Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary . "
B,Minor,"I I think that I have mm mm "
B,Task,"I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example comm then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel comm "
B,Task,"so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images comm so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time comm "
B,Task,"you just use the control button uh comm "
B,Task,"you just you you just choose the the option you want "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm the . "
B,Task,"and then you just hit the button "
B,Task,"and then you go to that channel . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train "
A,Task,"you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . "
B,Other,"Oh comm okay . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well I uh I also "
A,Task,"By associating each channel with the name or "
C,Task,"I I also think about uh another problem comm "
C,Task,"if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah comm "
C,Task,"the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . "
A,Task,"And for each one has his own . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Because uh I remember when I was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Or you have to s "
B,Other,"Yeah comm I wanna watch this comm I wanna watch that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty and just run comm s "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"A and in the same lines we would have a one more problem . "
D,Task,"If we are using the television in the different environments comm say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work comm that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Or we can switch on or switch off the the special comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's right "
D,Task,"that should be an option . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah that's "
C,Task,"well I think that's a good uh a good option "
C,Task,"because it's simple and uh simple to implement also comm so . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"I think these are the practical problems . "
D,Task,"So we need to take care of them in the design . "
A,Task,"Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting . "
A,Task,"It's time to close this meeting . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Well comm you you stay a five minutes . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Okay . "
D,Task,"I think we can just press the okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"So I see ya . "
A,Other,"Thanks for your collaborations . "
D,Elicit,"Okay . See you another thirty minutes . "
