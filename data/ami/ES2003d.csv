B,Task,"That should hopefully do the trick comm um . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Other,"Sorry about the small delay . "
B,Task,"Falling a little bit behind schedule . "
B,Task,"And that's uh fifteen twenty five . "
B,Minor,"Okay . So "
B,Other,"just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one comm um "
B,Elicit,"we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it ? "
B,Task,"Uh The new black comm I believe . "
B,Task,"Um something that looks good "
C,Minor,". "
B,Task,"'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end comm "
B,Task,"though we should never avoid functionality comm of course . "
B,Task,"Uh many of our components are gonna be standard comm off the shelf comm "
B,Task,"but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip "
B,Task,"and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display . "
B,Task,"Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber comm "
B,Task,"most likely gonna be double curved comm etcetera . "
B,Minor,"Okay . So um "
B,Task,"due to your hard work comm we might as well let the uh two designers go first comm "
B,Task,"and uh show us the prototype . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"it's a "
B,Task,"Quite how the best way to do this is comm I'm not sure comm "
A,Task,"I think if we both step up "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"and uh outline our ideas . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Now "
A,Task,"do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . "
A,Task,"Um for one thing comm it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ . "
A,Task,"As it turned out comm the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick comm "
A,Task,"though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit "
A,Minor,"for uh "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"ju just a thought . "
A,Task,"You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick "
A,Task,"that could then just be turn uh twisted round comm "
A,Task,"so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . "
A,Task,"But as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand comm the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful comm "
A,Task,"so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design . "
A,Minor,"Um now "
A,Task,"I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down . "
B,Task,"I'm afraid yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We'll go into that a bit more comm "
B,Task,"but please go on . "
A,Task,"this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing . "
A,Task,"Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle comm having maybe just a rubber grip over that "
A,Task,"which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form comm and a bit more ergonomic as well . "
A,Task,"As for the um as for the single curve comm um well this edge and this edge comm like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it comm "
A,Task,"but it's not absolutely necessary . "
A,Task,"Really the curve that's most needed is the underside "
A,Task,"so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this . "
A,Task,"Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder . "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Elicit,"Any further comments ? "
D,Task,"Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks comm "
D,Task,"because it's gonna be flat on one side comm "
D,Task,"so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this comm "
D,Elicit,"won't it ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . Yeah . "
D,Task,"'Cause it you can't get it curved . "
D,Task,"Uh because of costs . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm I mean "
A,Minor,"the "
A,Minor,"uh Yeah . "
D,Task,"And it's plastic as well comm "
D,Task,"so it won't be as comfortable on the hand . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand . "
A,Task,"One nice wee feature "
A,Task,"if we could if we could still do the rubber comm I though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of the rigid substructure . "
A,Task,"So it has a wee sort of tail "
A,Task,"that you just drape over your wrist "
A,Task,"so it stays in position nicely . "
A,Task,"Mm . Lovely . Um . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"yeah . Great . Um . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"I've got a "
C,Task,"if you load up my evaluation document . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Excellent work . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"Uh evaluation . "
C,Task,"Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . "
C,Minor,"Um then we will "
C,Task,"it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process . "
C,Minor,"So um "
C,Task,"not seven steps comm "
C,Task,"seven scale . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria comm "
C,Task,"we average that "
C,Task,"and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype . "
C,Task,"And uh the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies comm marketing strategies comm and also those I put together from the user requirements phase . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . Um "
C,Task,"if you flip the "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"those are the criteria . "
C,Task,"And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better comm "
C,Task,"but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned comm "
C,Task,"which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points . "
C,Task,"Put it mildly . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we have um true ? "
C,Task,"One comm t Seven comm eight comm oh . Fourth . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so "
C,Task,"we have to go through each point . "
C,Task,"If we imagine it's actually straight comm "
C,Task,"and just give it a a score . "
C,Minor,"So um "
C,Minor,"how well would you say the prototype is "
C,Elicit,"uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost comm or to be able to find them once they are lost . "
C,Elicit,"I mean comm uh is the homing thing still the locator comm is that still "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's still part of the design . "
C,Other,"Sure . "
C,Elicit,"And Adam comm we can keep that in ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I believe so . "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost comm "
B,Task,"'cause that would mean doing something about the human element comm "
C,Task,"Sure . "
B,Task,"but I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have . "
C,Minor,"T "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Sure . "
A,Task,"Mm . And making it a bright colour helps "
A,Minor,"with the "
A,Task,"personally I would have gone for purple . "
C,Other,"Mm . Bright colour . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we still have that noise thing comm "
C,Elicit,"yeah ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Os "
C,Elicit,"on a scale of one to seven comm how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost ? "
A,Task,"I'd say number one . "
C,Other,"Number one ? "
D,Task,"One . Yeah . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Number number one for the first criteria . "
A,Minor,"I think w if it was just the sounder then th I mean something I've found with uh w w "
A,Task,"with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile comm you can hear it comm "
A,Task,"but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"you can tell what room the mobile is "
D,Elicit,"What about what if the the volume on the T_V_'s turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote . "
A,Minor,"Bu "
D,Task,"Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually . Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm . Um "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Like y you wouldn't hear the speaker . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"just before we go through all of the steps here comm um well what we'll do is "
C,Elicit,"You wanna say something ? "
B,Task,"um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate comm "
B,Task,"and then we'll come back to the product evaluation "
B,Elicit,"if that's alright . "
C,Task,"That's fine . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah comm is that "
C,Task,"Oh that's that's fine . "
B,Minor,"Um so "
B,Elicit,"is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? "
B,Task,"And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this . "
C,Other,"What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna "
B,Elicit,"I is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? "
B,Elicit,"Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ? "
C,Task,"Um comm a few . "
C,Task,"Something I neglected from my initial research "
C,Task,"is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion comm and clothing fashion . "
C,Task,"That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important "
C,Task,"and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . "
C,Task,"So they say we put the fashion in electronics comm "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"they really mean it they they're very big on fashion comm "
C,Minor,"so . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"That's this bit right here . "
C,Task,"And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? "
C,Task,"I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface comm "
C,Task,"so it's kinda condensed into one . "
C,Task,"And we can come back to it comm you said . "
C,Minor,"So . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"No "
B,Task,"and which we will do very very shortly . "
B,Minor,"Um . Okay . "
B,Task,"Slight problem we had "
B,Task,"was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . "
B,Task,"Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ "
B,Task,"which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure "
B,Task,"because of course we required a chip as well . "
B,Task,"Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ comm "
B,Task,"at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface comm "
B,Task,"require more buttons comm etcetera . "
B,Task,"Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . "
B,Task,"Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs "
B,Task,"and we're just scraping it in comm "
B,Task,"we've got point two of a Euro left over there . "
B,Task,"So we're just managing it really . "
B,Task,"Even then as well comm um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick "
B,Task,"so I've used what I think's appropriate . "
B,Other,"With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . "
B,Task,"It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side comm "
B,Task,"for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . Um . "
C,Elicit,"Different languages ? "
B,Task,"That should still be viable . "
B,Task,"We've got an advanced chip comm "
B,Task,"we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . "
B,Task,"So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here . "
B,Task,"We do need to try and come up with an idea "
B,Task,"which could be continued with other people if need be . Um . "
B,Minor,"We can "
B,Other,"I can bring the excel up sheet up "
B,Other,"and uh show you if you wish um . "
B,Task,"I really think as m much as it pains me "
B,Task,"is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design comm "
B,Task,"possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . "
B,Task,"It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular "
A,Task,"and have it s so that the uh the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger . Mm . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"So that uh th "
B,Task,"It very much is about making concessions comm unfortunately . Um . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ? "
C,Elicit,"I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ? "
B,Elicit,"Um b b b da is you mean on the plastic comm or ? "
C,Minor,". "
B,Task,"Let's have a look . "
B,Task,"You now have as much information as I do . Um . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"as you can see here comm for example comm the battery really not very little choice in that one . "
B,Task,"We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well . "
B,Task,"Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to . "
B,Task,"I've said single curved . "
B,Task,"We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . "
B,Task,"Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost comm "
B,Task,"which I've had to very much make advantage of comm "
B,Task,"despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit . "
B,Task,"Problem comes here as you can see in the interface . Um "
B,Task,"if I've read this thing correctly comm then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . "
B,Task,"That might make sense comm "
B,Task,"because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what comm four point five Euros comm "
B,Task,"which is an awful lot comm "
B,Task,"so that could well be wrong . "
B,Task,"Even if we save point five there comm it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit comm "
B,Task,"which has had to be put to one side . "
B,Minor,"As you can see comm the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well "
B,Task,"because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick . "
C,Elicit,"Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ? "
C,Task,"That's quite significantly expensive . "
B,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters . Um "
C,Minor,". "
A,Minor,"Mm . yeah . "
B,Task,"as you can see I mean that's taken up well over half of the price . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Elicit,"I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go comm "
B,Task,"but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired comm "
B,Task,"this one comes in under price as you can see comm "
B,Task,"but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design . "
C,Task,"We don't even have uh speakers here . "
C,Minor,"The "
C,Minor,"like uh "
C,Minor,"we "
C,Elicit,"uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? Have we factored that in ? "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Uh no comm we haven't comm not "
C,Task,"Transmitter comm receiver comm speakers . Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ . "
C,Elicit,"Is that gonna be a button comm or "
B,Task,"That'll it literally would just be a button . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That's too expensive "
B,Minor,"We might have to "
D,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
B,Minor,"It looks like almost nothing "
B,Minor,"Mm . Oh "
B,Task,"good call comm "
B,Task,"I missed that . "
C,Task,"I I mean it's not on here comm "
C,Minor,"but um . "
B,Task,"that's a very valid point . "
C,Minor,"Did they s "
C,Elicit,"do we have to use an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"that's yeah . "
B,Minor,"So if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display comm then that's "
C,Elicit,"What's a hand dyna dynamo ? "
C,Elicit,"You have to wind it up ? "
B,Task,"I believe so comm yeah . "
B,Task,"That would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such comm "
C,Task,"Technology . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Fashion . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So basically "
D,Task,"the only new thing is the L_C_D_ on the remote now . "
B,Task,"Being manipulated by the joystick comm "
B,Unlab,"yeah . "
D,Other,"Oh comm and joystick comm "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Which I'm defining as scroll wheel . Um . "
C,Task,"And we couldn't replace the joystick comm "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it comm up down left and right comm "
C,Task,"and that would be more expensive "
C,Minor,"than a "
C,Elicit,"but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be comm "
B,Task,"that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of "
B,Task,"If we remove the L_C_ display comm we could save ourselves "
D,Task,"the remote . "
B,Task,"a fair amount . "
B,Minor,"Which you could "
D,Task,"But that's what makes it uh original though comm "
D,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
A,Task,"Mm . I think if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Um . Uh "
C,Minor,"k "
B,Task,"It's a shame . "
B,Minor,"We should possibly have "
B,Task,"If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to . "
C,Minor,"Does this does this bear in mind that "
C,Task,"I mean it's a bit ridiculous "
C,Task,"that they're gonna charge us what is it comm like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components comm "
C,Elicit,"you know . "
B,Task,"Again comm you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Um but for the purposes of this meeting comm I'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures . "
C,Task,"'Kay . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display "
B,Task,"'cause it's about what really separates us comm "
C,Task,"I think so . "
B,Task,"despite the cost it's gonna incur . Um "
B,Elicit,"are people maybe not happy with comm but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case comm to keep the L_C_D_ ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Um yeah I mean "
A,Other,"one thing comm "
A,Elicit,"I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean keep the um the articulation ? "
B,Task,"It's hard to tell . "
B,Task,"Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved comm "
A,Task,"This is what I'm wondering . "
B,Task,"and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Oh "
A,Task,"no comm I think I I it d that it needn't require it to be double curved . "
D,Minor,"It can be s "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"it can still be single curved comm "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"It's uh it's just it's just it's just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation . "
D,Minor,"You just . "
B,Elicit,"Single curved with articulation ? "
C,Task,"Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness "
C,Task,"and focus on the menu being the best interface ? "
C,Minor,"'Cause like we "
C,Elicit,"do we have re restrictions on software ? "
D,Task,"That's what we need for the joystick I think though . "
C,Other,"Oh "
C,Minor,"but there has to be "
A,Minor,"Mm . Yeah comm I mean "
A,Minor,"and I mean the uh "
A,Task,"I mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here comm "
A,Task,"the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight . "
A,Minor,"Um I mean "
A,Task,"yeah comm "
B,Task,"But the curves all o over hand comm "
A,Task,"on the on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it "
B,Elicit,"is it ? "
A,Task,"could just as easily be done um without curves . "
A,Task,"The curve that's really needed is up here comm "
C,Task,"joystick . "
A,Task,"to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it "
A,Task,"to have it rest on the top of the hand . "
C,Other,"Okay . Sure . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Other,"my bad . "
B,Task,"We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway comm "
B,Task,"so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria . "
B,Task,"Which is what we can get onto now . "
B,Minor,"As long as so are we gonna say w "
B,Task,"we have to keep an eye on the time as well comm "
B,Task,"but we're gonna say um single curved design "
C,Minor,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"wait a minute . "
C,Elicit,"Sample speaker ? What is a sample speaker ? "
C,Elicit,"Is that somewhat similar to what we want ? "
B,Task,"It could well be comm "
A,Task,"Mm no "
B,Minor,"but at a cost of "
A,Task,"that's that voice response thing that we got the email about . "
D,Task,"Costs four . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But I thought it was just completely pointless . "
C,Other,"You got a email about voice response ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I did not comm "
C,Minor,"so . "
A,Other,"Alright . "
A,Task,"B i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip "
A,Task,"that you could comm you know comm say hello to comm "
A,Task,"and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice . "
B,Other,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"yeah "
B,Task,"we'll definitely won't go with that one . "
C,Other,"We won't go with that one comm did you say ? "
C,Minor,"I mean I we "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"that's voice recognition comm so . "
C,Other,"Okay comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Um . So comm okay yeah comm "
B,Task,"battery definitely comm "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing . "
B,Task,"It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros comm um . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Okay . Okay . "
B,Minor,"Maybe even slight "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"well "
B,Task,"oh yeah comm pretty much point two Euros comm I'd say . "
B,Task,"So we'll leave that one for now . "
B,Minor,"we'll just have "
D,Elicit,"Are we going for a special colour at all ? "
B,Minor,"It's uh a case of um "
B,Task,"I'm uh slightly unsure . "
B,Task,"One point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right . "
B,Task,"So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more . Um . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"I was for a case . "
B,Minor,"At which point if "
D,Elicit,"Or had you already incorporated that ? "
C,Other,"Oh comm special colour for the case . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"you got point five there . "
B,Task,"It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct . "
B,Minor,"I'm not quite sure if they're "
B,Task,"I don't think they mean point five Euros per button . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
A,Task,"l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose . "
B,Task,"There we go . "
A,Task,"Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour "
A,Task,"that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room . "
C,Elicit,"W what's the default colour ? "
C,Elicit,"White or black ? "
B,Task,"Black's probably the normal colour you'd say comm "
A,Task,"Or grey . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"I quite like that colour that you're fetching there comm "
A,Task,"Yellow . "
B,Minor,"it's uh definitely for "
B,Task,"make it glow in the dark even better . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"will we go with that then ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"It's not and we can see "
B,Task,"we'll come back to uh your evaluation "
C,Task,"Sure . "
B,Other,"which you're probably now going to pan us "
B,Other,"but there we go . "
C,Task,"Okay . Okay . "
C,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"Just to give you an idea comm um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well comm "
B,Task,"I'm not sure how much time . "
B,Task,"We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet comm "
C,Task,"Right okay . Okay . "
B,Minor,"but . "
D,Task,"Think it's ten minutes left . "
B,Other,"Ten . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Elicit,"Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost . "
C,Minor,"Um . Okay . "
D,Task,"Special colour . "
C,Other,"Special colour . "
B,Task,"Mm mm four ? "
C,Other,"Uh uh four . "
B,Task,"Three ? Mm . "
C,Task,"Three if we're being generous comm I feel . "
A,Task,"Three . I think we can do three . "
D,Task,"Three . "
C,Task,"Think we're being generous here with three . "
A,Task,"Th the special colour doesn't would I think make a difference . "
A,Task,"It makes it stand out "
A,Minor,"from "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Task,"it's lost in a big pile of crap comm it stands out from the rest of the crap . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Reduce the number of unused buttons . "
C,Task,"We're down to t two buttons comm "
C,Elicit,"is it ? "
B,Task,"Two buttons . "
A,Task,"Two buttons and a joystick . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"so that's a one . "
C,Minor,"You know comm "
C,Minor,"where that's "
A,Task,"Totally . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I'd say we're doing well there . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"that was good . "
C,Elicit,"Easy to use interface comm buttons menu comm menus "
C,Minor,"that's "
C,Minor,"yeah "
C,Task,"that's good . "
C,Minor,"'Kay "
C,Minor,"that's "
C,Task,"we're not doing so badly . "
C,Minor,"Um easy to use "
C,Minor,"oh okay comm "
C,Task,"let's forget that one . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"Fancy looking . "
B,Minor,"As he models the "
A,Task,"It doesn't get much fancier . "
C,Task,"Sure . "
C,Task,"And we could do whatever we like with the L_ L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"let's just assume it's a good L_C_D_ display . "
C,Other,"Maybe I was panicking for no reason . "
D,Elicit,"Are we going one on ? "
D,Task,"I'd say we go two comm "
D,Task,"'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"Wouldn't it ? "
B,Minor,"I'd "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"w "
C,Minor,"maybe you'd be a bit too "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"yeah . There we go . Yeah comm "
D,Task,"With the articulators . With bells on it . "
C,Minor,"that's m "
C,Task,"that's that's better too . More accurate numbers . "
C,Elicit,"Technologically innovative . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"we're getting rid of the locator thing "
C,Minor,"which which "
B,Task,"Which is a shame . "
C,Task,"yeah "
A,Task,"Mm . I'd give it a three for this for that . "
D,Task,"No need for teletext . "
C,Minor,". "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote comm "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"but you see it in a lot of other places . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"mobile phones . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"And y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control comm "
C,Minor,"so it's "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"You say three ? "
C,Task,"I might go as far as two on that . "
C,Other,"Three . "
A,Task,"I'd give it a three . "
B,Task,"I'd be tempted with three comm yeah . "
C,Other,"Three . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"We'll get panned on the next one comm anyway . "
C,Elicit,"Materials that people find pleasing . "
C,Task,"Sponginess is what they really would have wanted comm apparently . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"w "
B,Task,"It is comm yeah . "
B,Other,"Don't blame them . "
B,Task,"Um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Plastic comm it sucks . "
B,Task,"But it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have . "
C,Task,"That's true . "
C,Task,"It's not a step backwards . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . I'd s I I'd give it a six comm to be honest . "
D,Task,"five ? "
D,Task,"Six ? "
D,Task,"Six comm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay let's give it a six . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"that's totally thrown everything off balance . "
C,Elicit,"Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . "
C,Minor,"W we could . "
C,Elicit,"What colour were we gonna make it ? "
D,Task,"Put a leopard print on it . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours . "
A,Task,"Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype "
C,Other,"I know comm "
C,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"'cause we had yellow . "
A,Task,"If I were buying one comm I'd go for purple . "
A,Task,"Leopard print would be cool . "
C,Task,"But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"we gotta . "
D,Task,"I'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that comm that's that'd stand out . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Like yellow comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"It would also help keep the the product placement "
D,Task,"Logo comm brand . "
B,Minor,"s "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Task,"But Th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing . "
B,Elicit,"Is it inspired by clothing fashion ? "
C,Elicit,"Is this like a banana type colour ? "
C,Elicit,"Could we stretch "
C,Task,"no still comm "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"it's not shaped like a banana is "
B,Minor,"It's kind o it "
A,Minor,"That's kinda i "
B,Task,"probably "
A,Task,"it won't be when it's been "
C,Minor,"Oh "
C,Elicit,"is that 'cause it's flat ? "
A,Task,"budgeted . "
C,Elicit,"What is what fruit or veg is flat ? "
A,Task,"I I think s I I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie . Um . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well . "
D,Task,"Yellow courgette . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg comm "
B,Elicit,"so comm what comm four ? "
C,Other,"Four ? "
C,Task,"Oh that's it's very ambitious comm "
B,Elicit,"Is that being too generous ? "
A,Task,"Mm . I'd I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . Is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions . "
C,Task,"yeah comm um . "
B,Minor,"Oh dear comm . "
C,Minor,"Sure . "
C,Minor,"Inspired by . "
A,Task,"Um I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"this this what we're gonna t this is their motto comm like . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And we're we're not doing well on it . "
C,Task,"This is their strategy . "
C,Task,"I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this "
C,Task,"and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks . "
C,Task,"Might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one . "
B,Elicit,"What would you think yourself ? "
C,Minor,"I would say "
C,Task,"I mean it's it's not at all comm right ? In any way or shape or form . "
C,Minor,"We didn't m "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"it's kind of curved "
B,Task,"and we can make it yellow comm "
B,Task,"and that's pretty much banana like . "
C,Task,"Okay comm the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay . "
B,Minor,"Si "
B,Task,"it's got a curve to it . "
C,Minor,"Right "
C,Task,"five . "
C,Elicit,"Is that sound reasonable ? "
B,Minor,"Am I "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I'll go with five . "
B,Elicit,"do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana ? "
C,Other,"Five . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"'Kay comm so "
C,Other,"we have one comm two comm three comm four comm five comm six comm seven . "
C,Other,"So five comm seven comm ten comm sixteen comm twenty one . "
C,Task,"Which gives us an average of three . "
C,Minor,"It's "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"this would be in the middle . "
C,Minor,"So we "
C,Task,"it's it's not bad . "
C,Task,"It's in the good section . "
B,Task,"It's not bad "
B,Minor,"and considering the "
B,Other,"don't pick the pen . Um . "
C,Other,"Oops . "
C,Other,"Sorry . I'm I'm sorry . "
B,Minor,"Y "
B,Other,"oh and you've knocked batteries out . "
B,Minor,"Um right okay "
D,Task,"'S bad design comm that thing . "
B,Minor,"it's "
B,Task,"considering the price we had to get this in comm to have a positive you know comm even based on the four of us being heavily biased comm um "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out I'd say possibly comm based on um the the cost features . "
D,Task,"Mm comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven comm we were to go down a grade to to four comm "
C,Minor,"we would have to do I mean we didn't "
C,Task,"we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic . "
C,Minor,"You know like "
C,Minor,"we didn't we didn't add "
C,Task,"we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things comm "
C,Task,"so I think we're definitely on the good bit . "
C,Task,"Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven comm that's still only three extra points over seven . "
C,Minor,"You know comm "
C,Minor,"it's "
A,Task,"Mm . Personally comm I think given that the product um only replaces a single remote control "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Minor,"we did it w "
C,Task,"it was okay . It was good . "
A,Task,"that you've already got comm "
A,Elicit,"are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ? "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"it depends who your who's what the target people are comm "
D,Task,"like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious "
B,Minor,"Maybe it's been targeted "
D,Task,"women would be going comm oh look at that comm "
D,Task,"'s cool comm "
D,Minor,"it looks like a "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"it's "
D,Task,"yellow comm "
D,Task,"looks like a banana comm "
D,Task,"it's cool "
D,Task,"it's gotta look good in the sitting room . "
B,Other,"Hide it in the fruit basket . "
D,Minor,"Rather than the L_C_D_ "
D,Task,"whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology it's good comm "
D,Task,"it's got an L_C_D_ screen "
D,Task,"'s only got two buttons and a joystick . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Elicit,"which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ? "
B,Task,"Probably the people technologically . "
B,Task,"They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff . "
C,Task,"I think so . "
C,Task,"I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone comm "
C,Task,"and she's had it for a long time comm "
C,Elicit,"you know . "
C,Task,"She uses it to make phone calls and that's it . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"Yeah . So "
C,Task,"I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick comm I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy comm "
C,Elicit,"you know . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"She'd be like is this a remote control comm "
C,Minor,"I don't "
C,Task,"how do you use it comm and stuff like that . "
C,Task,"So even if it is really user friendly to us comm but we're used to using menus all the time . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . I s I suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative comm "
A,Task,"um for someone who's sort of technophobic comm the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons comm "
A,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But like radical good comm maybe . "
B,Minor,"Okay . Um "
B,Elicit,"don't know how lo much longer we've got . "
B,Task,"At least five minutes I think . "
B,Task,"Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . Um . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction . "
B,Elicit,"Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them ? "
B,Task,"For example um we'll work backwards I suppose . "
B,Elicit,"The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with . "
B,Elicit,"Um people made good use of the uh pen and paper ? "
B,Minor,"I would say "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"got notes and doodles . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Wrote nearly a page comm "
C,Minor,"but not . "
B,Elicit,"I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be . "
C,Task,"I think tracking . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh "
A,Task,"of the researchers studying this . "
A,Task,"It's all p goes into their corpus . "
A,Task,"Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um "
B,Minor,"It must "
A,Task,"transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that woulda been pretty good . "
B,Task,"It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes . "
B,Task,"So maybe this is literally just a way around it . "
B,Task,"Um I dunno . "
B,Elicit,"How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ? "
D,Task,"Good . "
C,Minor,"I'd "
C,Task,"yeah I liked it comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,". "
B,Elicit,"Leadership . As much as can be leadered in this uh thing . "
D,Task,"Very good . "
C,Minor,"I li "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"top marks . "
B,Elicit,"Um last one we've got is room for creativity . "
C,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"Now comm "
A,Task,"Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along comm "
B,Minor,"I think we got "
A,Task,"squish . "
D,Other,"We're burs bursting with creativity . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Task,"We we're not lacking in ideas comm "
C,Minor,"you know "
C,Minor,"it's "
C,Task,"that was not the problem . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"I think of in the end comm ideas that can be used sadly . "
B,Task,"Not so much that we weren't full of ideas comm but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"It's a bit of a pity . "
B,Task,"Um I would have to agree on that . "
B,Task,"I think we needed a larger budget . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector comm then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is . "
B,Task,"Because they will pay outrageous cash to "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm . I mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh "
B,Task,"first on the market . "
A,Task,"in added expense . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And the price was like it was twice the w assembly cost . "
D,Elicit,"And would it have to be twice that ? "
D,Task,"It could be like coulda had the assembly like maybe fifteen Euro . "
B,Minor,"It could even "
D,Task,"We'll still settle for twenty five . "
B,Task,"That's true comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Maybe . "
B,Task,"Um I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess . As to a the costs involved . "
B,Task,"But I mean we've got a a prototype . "
A,Task,"Such as it is . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"I dunno comm "
B,Task,"I I think it's gone okay today comm considering the information that we've had at our disposal comm and um such . "
C,Task,"Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more Yeah comm to begin with . "
D,Task,"In the beginning comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Probably would have "
B,Task,"mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I would have to agree . "
B,Task,"It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . "
B,Task,"Always hard to tell until you know the costs . Um . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Are the costs within budget ? "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"they are now "
B,Task,"that we have our slightly less than capable product . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"We've evaluated it comm "
B,Task,"and we can say that we came out with a value of three . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Actually I want th "
A,Other,"one thing I would say "
A,Task,"I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions "
A,Task,"and see just how much of a difference the over going over-budget "
A,Task,"um m would make to sales . "
B,Minor,"It's "
B,Task,"yeah ? "
C,Minor,"And like response from consumers . "
A,Task,"And we could even you know comm market two versions . "
A,Task,"Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber . "
B,Other,"And then the final one where you get to call it Hal . "
B,Task,"But we'll go into that later . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Sure . "
B,Minor,"Right um "
B,Elicit,"is there anything else that anybody would like to to add comm um "
B,Elicit,"anything they think that's not been covered comm "
B,Other,"before I quickly write up a final report . "
B,Task,"Um I dunno comm "
B,Task,"I mean we've got a product . "
B,Task,"We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be comm "
B,Task,"but we've got something "
B,Task,"we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell . "
B,Task,"And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"There is a huge market . "
B,Task,"I mean we've briefly touched on it "
B,Task,"but we've no more knowledge "
B,Task,"then there's little we can say on that . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . So um "
B,Task,"unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add comm we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to "
B,Task,"and then we can finish up the writing and such . "
A,Other,"And I can get my bus . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Okay comm let's "
B,Other,"Uh thank you for your participation . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Task,"I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget comm and that we had to cut a lot of stuff . "
C,Task,"It's like man comm we we can't have the locator thing . "
C,Minor,"And s "
C,Task,"yeah that's just bad . "
C,Elicit,"Do you think maybe the prices were were made ? "
B,Task,"That a question we can ask . "
