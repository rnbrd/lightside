C,Minor,"Excellent . "
C,Minor,"So um "
C,Task,"I sent you the agenda comm "
C,Task,"it was on the in the project documents . "
C,Elicit,"I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . "
C,Task,"Anyway comm it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time comm "
C,Task,"so we'll go round each of you in turn "
C,Task,"and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . "
C,Task,"Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with comm so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts comm "
C,Minor,"so that's "
C,Task,"we need to know about the components' properties comm materials comm the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching . "
A,Task,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Um comm do you wanna start again ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Let me "
C,Task,"we've got forty minutes . "
A,Minor,"Right s "
A,Task,"so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation comm "
C,Other,"You haven't made a PowerPoint comm okay . "
A,Task,"yeah comm "
A,Other,"I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um mm comm "
C,Other,"Let's hope the pen holds out . "
A,Minor,"okay comm so "
A,Minor,"basically I'll start off by uh "
A,Task,"I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options "
A,Task,"and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"so w what you see here is so "
A,Task,"this is the outside of the remote comm right ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"If you open it comm you have a circuit board here comm right comm "
A,Task,"and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . "
A,Task,"This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here comm which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"If you flip the printed circuit board comm and this is th the most important point here comm "
A,Task,"uh everything else is kind of "
A,Task,"Okay comm so if you flip the circuit board comm this is what it looks like . "
A,Task,"So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"and uh "
A,Task,"on pressing this button I a circuit completes comm "
A,Task,"the information goes to the chip comm which is somewhere here "
A,Task,"and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation comm which goes goes out through there . "
A,Task,"So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make comm "
A,Task,"you can ge get them printed as you want to comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost comm the way we want to have . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Right ? So that's the important point here comm "
A,Task,"so these are the different options that we have . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"So the batteries comm I'll start with the battery comm right ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells comm yeah ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes comm right ? "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Task,"And dynamos . "
A,Minor,"Um "
B,Elicit,"Does that mean like a wind-up one ? "
A,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this comm "
B,Task,"A wind-up remote . "
A,Task,"but these are the different things that the company makes comm "
A,Minor,"so th they'll they'll "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"since uh they'll come internally from the company comm they'll be eas uh cheaper comm uh all these options . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones . "
B,Task,"You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike comm "
B,Task,"and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And charging their remote comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing comm 'cause that's just "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's a good option . "
D,Elicit,"So what was what was this k ka "
A,Task,"The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches comm since our hand keeps moving comm it keeps the watch ticking . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Uh yeah . "
A,Task,"But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control comm because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"For a remote comm 'cause you "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And the fourth option is the solar cells comm which are also made by the company . "
B,Other,"Yay . "
A,Task,"Environment friendly . "
A,Other,"Okay um so I'll list things "
A,Task,"and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"There are different cases that can be provided . "
A,Task,"They can be basically the shape of the cases comm they can be flat comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat comm "
A,Task,"and they can be curved with on both the sides . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"These are the three options comm right ? "
A,Minor,"Um "
D,Elicit,"Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control comm yeah comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"would it be flat on both the sides comm would be curved from one side comm or whatever "
D,Task,"Yeah comm mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"uh there were different kind of supplements available comm "
A,Task,"um like it can be in plastic comm rubber comm wood comm or titanium comm right ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
B,Other,"Did you say wool ? "
A,Task,"Wo wo wood . "
C,Task,"Wood comm wood . "
B,Other,"Wood . Oh right . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Not wool . "
C,Other,"A fluffy remote . "
B,Minor,". "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you'll understand why when we get to my presenta . "
A,Task,"Oh really ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Minor,"Um the "
A,Task,"so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment comm "
A,Task,"so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use comm because it relates to the overall image of the company comm "
A,Task,"but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface . "
A,Task,"If we choose this comm we cannot use titanium . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"For for these two we can use titanium comm wood comm rubber comm or plastic . "
C,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Minor,"Uh okay comm "
A,Task,"the interface options now . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we can have push-buttons comm like most remotes do "
A,Task,"and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . "
A,Minor,"Ooh . "
A,Task,"Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh "
B,Minor,"Sony . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm something like that . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"So comm and they have "
A,Task,"they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"The scroll plus push . "
A,Task,"So this is something that has been recently developed by the company comm um in the last decade comm so not too recent . "
A,Task,"And L_C_D_s comm "
A,Task,"we can have L_C_D_s . "
A,Task,"So these two are recent and and this is q quite old . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"The various electronic options are um uh "
A,Task,"so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh "
A,Task,"so there's there's a chip behind this one comm right ? "
A,Task,"The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive comm so we can put put in uh whatever we want comm "
A,Task,"but the various integrated circuit options are comm we have either a simple one "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"or a regular "
A,Task,"or advanced . "
A,Task,"And uh the price goes up as we go down comm obviously . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"okay comm so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um the "
A,Task,"we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels . "
A,Minor,"Right ? "
A,Task,"Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Uh "
A,Task,"besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender comm "
A,Task,"which is did not explained what i what it was comm "
A,Minor,"but I'm guessing that uh "
A,Task,"so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . "
A,Task,"So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know comm as soon as you press a button comm it it mm uh give gives you feedback comm one five or whatever . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm on . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um and uh "
A,Task,"I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not comm but anyway . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So comm these are the different options that we have . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"th that's that's basically "
A,Task,"now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know comm uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Excellent . "
C,Elicit,"Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board comm so that if we need to "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm yeah comm sure . Sure . Yeah . "
C,Task,"you can sit down comm but just "
C,Task,"we might need you to leap up . "
C,Elicit,"What are you comm PowerPoint comm or "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Um I have some PowerPoint comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Other,"Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ? "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Other,"Some sort of radiation ? "
B,Other,"No it's got its little camera in there comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"plug it in . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"'S a "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it should should do it . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Right comm interface concept . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Um to be honest actually comm I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time comm I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk . "
C,Task,"That's fine . "
D,Task,"So um yeah comm this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface "
D,Task,"um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um "
D,Minor,"and and which "
D,Task,"uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . "
D,Task,"So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well comm and colour comm and so on . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet "
D,Task,"and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness "
D,Task,"and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant . "
D,Minor,"Um and then um this uh this um "
D,Task,"this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So some findings um um . "
D,Task,"So in in the case of many user interfaces comm they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use "
D,Task,"and um and it's just confusing comm it takes y know time to learn . "
D,Minor,"Um okay comm "
D,Other,"and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . "
D,Task,"Okay comm some of them are here . "
D,Task,"Um well the picture is not very clear comm "
D,Minor,"but as you can see comm there are actu "
D,Other,"oi comm oh oh oh comm "
D,Other,"sorry for that . "
D,Other,"'S go back . "
A,Task,"That's nice one . "
D,Other,"Ah comm no comm please . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"so yeah comm they're quite big and have many many buttons . "
D,Task,"Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one comm "
D,Task,"because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . "
D,Task,"And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . "
B,Task,"Ugly . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Um okay . "
D,Task,"So let's carry on with this . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"So uh um o other findings "
D,Task,"um some new things um used comm "
D,Task,"uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . "
D,Task,"Our own company has developed a new in user interface "
D,Minor,"uh wait comm "
D,Task,"no this is not the one . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm there is a "
D,Task,"we can uh include voice recognition "
D,Minor,"and um it allows "
D,Task,"i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display . "
C,Minor,"It's "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Um s another new development is a scroll button comm "
D,Task,"which was also th also already mentioned . "
D,Task,"And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh "
D,Other,"mm sorry uh "
D,Task,"speaker unit I guess it's it should be . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um and this means that um once "
D,Task,"uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition comm "
D,Task,"but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker comm there can be a um pre-programmed answer comm "
D,Task,"for example comm you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello "
D,Task,"and it says some hello and your name or whatever . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh comm hi yeah . "
D,Task,"So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"Uh sorry comm "
A,Elicit,"uh can you go back for a second ? "
A,Elicit,"Um uh are you sure wha what this means comm a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? "
A,Minor,"Uh oh yeah are th "
C,Task,"It's like the like you said comm no ? "
C,Task,"The scroll scroll wheel . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm you can't "
D,Task,"No no comm "
D,Task,"the scroll button is a different thing . "
D,Task,"I I have a picture if you just a moment comm "
D,Other,"I'll I'll show you . "
D,Task,"I wasn't completely sure myself comm "
D,Task,"but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel comm it's like not separate buttons . "
D,Task,"Look comm this one here . "
A,Task,"Oh okay comm the iPod thing comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Oh comm it's like the iPod . "
D,Task,"But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round comm "
B,Task,"G yeah comm no comm you can . "
D,Task,"it's like you press this or this or "
A,Task,"Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh "
B,Task,"It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse comm and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"Alright comm right . Okay comm okay . "
B,Minor,"and it yeah . It is "
A,Task,"So instead of going down you just spin "
B,Task,"You just go round "
A,Minor,"yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and it is a bit weird at first comm "
B,Task,"but it's actually very like fast . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower comm "
B,Task,"so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Right . "
D,Task,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"Do you know comm if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ comm then it's a lot faster than the wheel comm "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but you've got a lot less control over it . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Right . "
A,Other,"So maybe I should include that here as well comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"L_C_D_s um plus spinning . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay comm and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"It it has to be small comm simple . "
D,Task,"Okay comm we decided to include voice recognition comm "
D,Task,"so to have the standard uh major buttons like on comm off comm um ch the channels and and then um volume "
D,Task,"and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . "
D,Minor,"Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um "
D,Task,"and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button comm "
D,Task,"I thought it could be for for voice like comm I dunno comm it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . "
D,Task,"There is uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So yeah comm that's uh that's it . "
C,Task,"Excellent . "
C,Task,"Okay comm straight to trends comm "
C,Task,"and then we can discuss it all at once . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Okay comm I've put the copy of the presentation in um the "
C,Task,"The project documents . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Excellent . "
C,Task,"If you two could both do that as well comm in case we need to refer to it . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"Cool . "
C,Task,"Here it comes . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Fabulous . Okay comm cool . "
B,Task,"Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Now comm the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect comm which is twice as important as the third a aspect . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So comm I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"which I think given the target group is what you would expect comm really . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um comm you know comm people want something new comm "
B,Task,"something technologically innovative and different comm "
B,Task,"so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like comm quite the thing to go for . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"And um comm yeah it wants to look fancy comm fancy look and feel . "
A,Task,"So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things comm is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ? "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm sure . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Right . So mm uh so it "
C,Task,"That's over on the interface comm "
C,Task,"if if you could put "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"so probably voice recognition is is kind of important comm right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um and an "
C,Task,"And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"so that means we need an advanced thing . "
A,Task,"Okay comm I I have a point about L_C_D_ comm "
A,Task,"I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . "
A,Task,"W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback comm right comm to the user who's pressing buttons comm "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"and the feedback can come through television itself comm "
A,Elicit,"so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ? "
B,Task,"Depends how fast your television runs comm really comm "
B,Elicit,"don't don't you think ? "
B,Task,"I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes "
B,Task,"and you put the number in the remote "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"and then you wait "
B,Task,"and then it goes to the T_V_ "
B,Task,"and then you wait comm "
B,Task,"and then it comes comm "
B,Task,"so i it actually takes quite a long time . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"And if you get the number in wrong comm then it's a bit of a pain comm "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"so I think comm you know comm a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . "
B,Task,"But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit . "
A,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen comm "
B,Other,"You know ? "
C,Task,"so if you're watching something "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's true comm yeah comm "
B,Minor,"And i it would be like "
A,Minor,"that's also "
B,Task,"I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on comm "
B,Task,"and you could just see that on the remote rather than "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone comm you know comm "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"like you have the slidey ones "
B,Task,"and you have the flippy ones "
B,Task,"and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched . "
C,Task,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control comm you know "
B,Task,"or like a minimalist remote control . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So you got your buttons one to nine comm your on and off and your volume on that "
A,Minor,"Mm right . "
B,Task,"and then if you want to mess about with it comm you flip it open and comm "
C,Task,"And then you can flip it open . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
A,Task,"because of style and "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"so that kind of decides your whole chip thing . "
A,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"You you agree ? Maarika comm yeah ? "
D,Task,"Yep comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Right . "
A,Other,"So L_C_D_s comm yeah comm definitely . "
B,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Task,"Go on . "
B,Task,"Cool . "
B,Task,"Okay comm apparently comm fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration . "
B,Other,"Sorry comm "
B,Task,"I discovered clip art . "
B,Task,"Um so these will be an important feature for clothes comm shoes and furniture . "
B,Task,"So I mean comm I'm taking this to mean comm you know comm curviness . "
B,Elicit,"Do you know ? "
B,Task,"'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables . You know ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"and possibly even uneven comm "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"like not not symmet "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"bit of asymmetry and stuff . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there comm "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Um yeah "
B,Task,"comm I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"Something a bit squishy and "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but I mean y you have to "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"we we have "
D,Task,"So it could be like a rubbery "
A,Task,"we have rubber comm "
D,Minor,"yeah comm uh-huh . "
A,Task,"but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using "
B,Task,"Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"and it'd help if you drop it comm "
C,Task,"it protects it as well . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"To some degree . "
A,Task,"So if if we use uh latex cases comm they won't allow us to use solar cells comm as an energy source "
A,Task,"that is the constraint comm "
C,Task,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"so um we could use titanium comm wood or plastic uh or uh "
C,Task,"Or if we want to use the the latex comm then we have to go with one of the other um power things . "
B,Task,"If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"w energy source . "
B,Task,"you could just bounce it up and down . "
C,Task,"From from bouncing it . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm tap it on the desk comm yeah . "
C,Task,"You can have it as like a little ball to bounce comm that flips open . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Um so yeah comm um okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"So probably double curved surface is the way to go comm "
A,Minor,"yeah comm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Mm yeah . "
A,Task,"Or or curved at one end and flat on the top comm "
A,Task,"because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides comm then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons comm etcetera . "
A,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"You have to have a certain element of flatness comm I think . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it comm you know comm "
B,Task,"it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
A,Task,"singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much comm does it ? "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Minor,"It uh "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference . "
B,Task,"I I have one of those s slidey phones "
B,Task,"and I mean the back is essentially straight comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"but it's curvy comm so . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Besides comm you have four sides to a thing comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm 'cause the "
A,Minor,"Uh I think uh "
B,Task,"so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"and comm you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ? "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Dunno . "
A,Elicit,"Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh "
A,Task,"because um according to the information that I have comm I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case . "
A,Task,"It does not say anything about uh whether technically comm you know comm this this stuff is available at all . "
C,Task,"Nothing to open them . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ comm which I think is where it came from . "
A,Task,"Right comm yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"But no comm my research didn't tell me anything comm "
B,Task,"which is why we have all the pictures comm "
B,Task,"'cause I had nothing better to do with my time . "
A,Task,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Okay comm cool . "
C,Elicit,"Anything else ? "
C,Elicit,"What've we got ? "
B,Task,"Uh combine style with a level of functionality comm "
B,Task,"um beauty and practicality "
B,Task,"and a thing of beauty and p function . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so . "
A,Other,"Cool comm thanks . "
B,Elicit,"Okay ? "
D,Other,"Thanks "
C,Task,"Looking at what we've got comm we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Let's let's try to r rub off things and "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"rub off some of those . "
A,Task,"yeah comm "
A,Minor,"so um "
A,Elicit,"hand dynamos are definitely out comm right ? "
A,Task,"You you got a wind dynamo comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah uh-hum yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's not that's not streamlined and sexy comm having a having a wind up . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal comm "
C,Minor,"I think tha "
A,Minor,"but uh "
B,Task,"It's about the practicality of it really comm isn't it ? You know ? "
A,Minor,"it's "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"As against a watch comm which constantly keeps moving comm "
B,Minor,"I mean if "
A,Task,"this this thing will have to be tapped every time comm "
A,Task,"which which might be very frustrating for the user . "
C,Task,"Depends how much how much movement it really needs . "
A,Task,"Kinetic energy it needs "
C,Task,"Pr presumably if they're suggesting it comm then we could use it . "
A,Task,"I don't have too much technical information on that comm "
A,Task,"yeah comm right . "
A,Task,"Okay comm let's keep it option uh keep an option comm "
C,Task,"I'd I'd keep it on . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out comm right ? "
C,Task,"We don't want that "
A,Task,"It has to be at least curved from one side comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"it's no it's not not vegetable . "
D,Minor,"it's "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"we still have all all the options . "
A,Elicit,"Wood comm do you think wood will be a good idea ? "
D,Minor,"N wood is "
D,Minor,"I can't n "
D,Minor,"how do you "
D,Task,"uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh "
A,Task,"Mm . "
D,Task,"you can't make it like thin and "
A,Task,"Right . "
D,Other,"The wood thing . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I can't imagine a m wooden remote control . "
D,Task,"Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in comm "
D,Task,"so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break comm "
D,Minor,"wi mm-mm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"it's it's much more uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences comm I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more "
D,Task,"U yeah wood is not really yeah . "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"Well it's not very cleanable either comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's true . "
B,Elicit,"do you know . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's it's not a practical "
B,Task,"I mean it's it's alright for a table comm "
B,Task,"but for a remote control comm you know . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And splinters and stuff and "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"okay wood is out . "
B,Task,"It just m doesn't make any sense comm I think is the thing with wood . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
D,Task,"in the case of remote control not really . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm now for the really interesting stuff comm the interface . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Right comm so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry comm "
A,Task,"but uh it seems to be out of trend comm you know comm "
A,Minor,"nobody seems to be "
B,Task,"You have to have some push-buttons comm don't you ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but "
D,Minor,"you um "
D,Task,"I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them comm wouldn't you ? "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"G "
B,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm right . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm so for channel numbers but "
A,Task,"Oh comm if if we have L_C_D_ displays comm that opens up a whole world comm you know comm "
A,Task,"if you have an L_C_D_ display comm then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display . "
D,Minor,"But I th "
D,Task,"yeah "
D,Task,"but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah comm it's faster "
C,Task,"Just for fast "
D,Minor,"with a m yeah and w if we dis and "
D,Task,"when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing comm then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control comm "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"but if you do want to use L_C_D_ comm then you flip it open comm "
D,Task,"but it's it it's more time-consuming . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made comm where comm you know comm the buttons that people use all the time comm you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . "
A,Task,"Mm right . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And it "
C,Task,"yeah "
C,Task,"L_ L_C_D_ . "
A,Task,"So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . "
A,Task,"Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? "
A,Task,"Or do we have just uh channel plus comm channel minus comm just to just to scroll ? "
D,Task,"No comm no comm "
D,Task,"I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers comm "
D,Task,"because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels . Um "
A,Other,"The numbers . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ? "
A,Task,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Or "
A,Task,"on the L_C_D_ we can comm you know "
B,Minor,"G yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I would say buttons comm "
B,Task,"I would think buttons comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"because it's "
C,Task,"Buttons . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"It's it's the "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"I think the thing is comm so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel comm then it should be easier to use than any other remote comm "
A,Minor,"So mm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and then if someone wants to comm you know comm change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible comm "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
B,Minor,"but comm you know comm I mean most of the time "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ comm I think is the the the issue there . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so buttons definitely in "
A,Task,"but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um "
C,Task,"I think that's what you guys are gonna do next comm "
A,Other,"Uh okay . "
C,Task,"so if we put down the key um things that we want . "
A,Task,"Okay comm okay comm so the components . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Right comm so uh what about the the scrolling uh ? "
D,Other,"Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I yeah comm about the spinning wheel . "
D,Task,"So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing comm "
B,Task,"E either or "
D,Minor,"it's uh "
D,Task,"you can al include everything in the spinning if you "
C,Task,"Just spinning and not scrolling comm I would say . "
B,Task,"G yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah comm yeah comm "
D,Minor,"in that case . "
B,Task,"I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so you have to decide whether you you know comm you want to be going so fast or not . "
B,Task,"But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber comm on the basis that it's spongy comm then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm um "
C,Task,"But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing comm effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side comm but you folded it in half . "
D,Minor,"Ah comm but I mean you can "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . "
C,Other,"Th that would be on one side comm uh-huh . "
A,Task,"I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I um I think so too comm "
A,Minor,"Uh i it "
C,Task,"No comm I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside . "
D,Task,"I mean the case would be "
D,Task,"yeah "
B,Task,"You want an outside of rubber "
D,Task,"the case would be rubber and the the buttons comm "
B,Minor,"and then open it up and "
A,Task,"Or or at the corners comm edges comm just the edges covered by rubber or something like that . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"rubber buttons comm but then "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or maybe like interchangeable cases . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel comm "
B,Task,"but I have like a you know comm obviously my iPod's not made of rubber comm "
B,Task,"but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it "
B,Task,"and I can change the colour comm theoretically comm to match my outfit . "
A,Minor,"Right comm right . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Right comm "
A,Task,"okay comm so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . "
A,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway comm right ? "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"That's right comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"that's what they're after . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"I'll rub that out . "
A,Task,"And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than "
A,Task,"Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such comm you know comm just keep it black comm or "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"I think we um "
D,Task,"it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company comm "
D,Elicit,"so would it be like yellow comm grey and black or something comm or "
C,Task,"I guess . "
B,Task,"That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm does "
C,Task,"Bananas . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Banana's yellow comm yeah comm definitely . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons "
B,Task,"and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours comm do you know ? "
B,Minor,"So you could have like "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple "
C,Task,"Green . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um okay comm if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . "
A,Task,"Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to "
C,Task,"We need the advanced yeah . "
A,Task,"um what we do need to consider comm however comm is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes comm "
A,Task,"so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"So I'll rub off the other two . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or "
C,Minor,"That was the "
A,Minor,"Oh is "
A,Elicit,"oh the constraint was uh "
C,Task,"We can't have solar panels with rubber comm so . "
B,Minor,"If "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"solar panels with the rubber . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . So "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm so we lose that I think . "
C,Task,"Shall we go for if we're going for rubber comm we think uh on as our case comm and then "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"And the buttons as well comm I think . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I think uh "
C,Task,"We've got five more minutes . "
A,Minor,"we'll have uh uh "
A,Task,"using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one comm I mean comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"a although it does seem uh interesting . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But it does not hold any advantages as such for a "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"It's just a gimmick . "
C,Task,"mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Uh okay comm so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback comm right ? "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that comm so "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost comm then I'd put them in comm "
A,Task,"Ye yeah comm "
A,Task,"we we don't have too much information about it comm um "
C,Minor,"but if it's "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but it it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company comm yeah . "
C,Task,"It's from the company comm so "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm okay comm "
A,Task,"so so th this is in as well then comm the sample speaker . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"And the case is curved on one side comm but then flat flat comm so it's flipped into each other . "
A,Task,"Flat on the top . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm sure j "
C,Minor,"Just so we can "
B,Other,"Sorry comm "
B,Other,"do you want me to "
C,Task,"Nothing comm "
C,Other,"it's right comm I'm just "
C,Other,"There we go . "
B,Elicit,"What does um I_C_S_ mean ? "
A,Other,"I_C_s ? "
A,Task,"Uh integrated circuits . "
B,Task,"Okay comm cool . "
B,Elicit,"So it's advanced integrated circuits ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Uh oh now I've gone too far . "
A,Elicit,"Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s comm mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We're on our way . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery comm "
C,Task,"the advanced chip "
A,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself comm um made out of rubber "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"and the buttons are also rubber . "
C,Task,"We're having push-buttons on the outside "
C,Task,"and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel comm "
C,Task,"and we're incorporating voice recognition . "
C,Task,"That's our overall concept comm "
D,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"and it's gonna look sort of vegetable comm "
C,Task,"and be in bright vegetable colours . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Elicit,"So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ comm or would it be on the outer "
C,Minor,"I think it's on the "
B,Task,"Imagine it would be inside . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So um actually that could like really cut down your thing comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"so you've got your outside comm which is like minimalist comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel comm which you can incorporate buttons into . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
B,Task,"Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"On the "
B,Task,"You've maybe got comm you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and four of the buttons are in the wheel comm "
B,Task,"and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel comm "
C,Task,"In the centre comm "
C,Task,"yeah comm sure . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay comm so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . "
C,Task,"In the meantime comm the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . "
C,Task,"Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design "
C,Task,"and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . "
C,Task,"And as well as that comm the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay "
C,Task,"and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Cool . "
C,Elicit,"Is that all okay ? "
C,Task,"And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder comm it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Cool comm "
B,Other,"I'm gonna go and sit on my own . "
C,Other,"Y ah nobody wants to talk to you . "
B,Other,"I know comm I'm hated . "
C,Task,"Unplug yourself . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"I've got a bit tangled up in all this "
D,Elicit,"So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with "
C,Task,"I dunno comm "
C,Minor,"maybe I would car "
D,Minor,"we need to "
