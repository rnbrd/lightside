Speaker,DialogAct,Text
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Soon as I get this . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"This is our last meeting . "
A,Other,"Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . "
A,Task,"Uh and then we'll have a comm the prototype presentation . "
A,Task,"Um then we will um do an evaluation . "
A,Task,"Uh or we'll see what comm what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . "
A,Task,"Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . "
A,Task,"Um then we'll do the evaluation comm "
A,Task,"and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make comm "
A,Task,"or hopefully everything will fall right in line . "
A,Other,"Um let's see comm "
A,Task,"minutes from the last meeting . "
A,Task,"Um we looked at uh the the trends . "
A,Task,"We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . "
A,Task,"It was twice as important as anything else . "
A,Task,"Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . "
A,Task,"Um and a spongy feel . "
A,Task,"So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . "
A,Task,"Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . "
A,Task,"Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . "
A,Task,"Um looking at other other devices . "
A,Task,"Um the iPod comm we really liked the look of that . "
A,Task,"Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . "
A,Task,"Um a two part remote comm which was what were were originally looking at . "
A,Task,"Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . "
A,Task,"But I think we've still decided not to go with that . "
A,Task,"Then we looked at the components um "
A,Task,"the materials for the case comm the different energy sources comm the different types of chips comm "
A,Task,"um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . "
A,Minor,"Um and basically how comm "
A,Task,"what were making for the prototype . "
A,Other,"So I'm going to leave it at that "
A,Task,"and let you guys take over . "
C,Elicit,"The prototype discussion . "
A,Task,"The prototype yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Do you need a this ? "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"There is our remo the banana . "
B,Task,"Can try to plug that in there "
B,Minor,"but "
C,Minor,"Um yeah "
C,Task,"basically we we st went with the colour yellow . "
C,Task,"Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned comm it's basically designed around a banana . "
C,Task,"Um but it would be held in such a fashion comm "
C,Minor,"where it is comm "
C,Task,"obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . "
C,Task,"These would be like the rubber comm the rubber grips . "
C,Minor,"So that's "
C,Task,"so that would hopefully help with grip comm or like the ergonomics of it . "
C,Task,"Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . "
C,Task,"You have to use your imagination a little bit . "
C,Task,"And this here represents the screen comm where you comm where you'd go through . "
A,Task,"Very nice . "
C,Task,"And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod comm "
C,Task,"where that one way ch through channels comm that way th other way through channels . "
C,Task,"Volume up and down . "
C,Task,"And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go comm you press that and go through the menus . "
C,Task,"It's that that simple . "
C,Task,"That just represents the infrared uh beam . "
C,Task,"That's a simple on and off switch . "
C,Task,"Um I don't know comm "
C,Task,"we could use the voice . "
C,Task,"T that blue bits should be yellow comm "
C,Task,"that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . "
C,Minor,"And um "
C,Task,"that's about it . "
C,Task,"It's as simple as you comm we could make it really . "
C,Elicit,"Is there anything you want to add ? "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"That's what we have there . "
B,Task,"That's plastic . "
B,Task,"Plastic covered with rubber . "
B,Task,"We might uh add some more underneath here . "
B,Task,"Maybe give it comm give it a form . "
B,Task,"I mean you're supposed to hold it like that comm "
B,Task,"but um just if you grab it comm take it from somewhere comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Doesn't make much make much difference . "
B,Minor,"so yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose . "
B,Minor,"you have some rub yeah . "
B,Task,"Exactly comm "
B,Task,"use both . "
B,Task,"Might as well think about "
C,Task,"T the actual thing might be smaller . "
B,Task,"Th think about the button as well . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Like either put either one one on either side or "
A,Minor,"What but "
A,Elicit,"what's that button ? "
B,Task,"not do it at all . "
C,Task,"Just the on and off . "
B,Task,"It's a quick on-off button . "
A,Other,"Uh comm 'kay . "
B,Minor,"That's um "
B,Task,"yeah I think it's pretty important . "
B,Task,"So you don't have to fiddle with that . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
B,Elicit,"Right ? "
B,Minor,"Um that's not um "
B,Task,"I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You wanna play with that over there . "
B,Other,"There you go . "
C,Task,"It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh comm "
A,Task,"Would you like to uh "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"Right . "
D,Task,"Pretty impressive . "
A,Task,"Well done . "
D,Task,"Kind of a banana . "
C,Task,"And whether or not it would fall into the cost everything I suppose . "
C,Task,"With the scroll and the L_C_D_ . "
A,Task,"Well luckily we are going to find out . "
A,Task,"Or not luckily . "
A,Elicit,"Um do you have a marketing presentation for us . "
D,Task,"I do . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . "
D,Task,"Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . "
D,Task,"And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . "
D,Task,"And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . "
D,Task,"Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . "
D,Task,"And one is going to mean true comm that we did actually achieve that . "
D,Task,"With seven being false comm we did not achieve that . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"So for the first one comm we need to decide comm did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? "
B,Minor,". "
A,Task,"I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So if they think that what is out there is ugly comm then yes I would say comm I would say most definitely . "
C,Minor,"I would . "
A,Task,"It's bright . "
C,Task,"It's bright . "
C,Minor,"It's "
A,Task,"It still has your traditional black . "
C,Task,"It's curved . "
C,Minor,"It's not "
C,Task,"there's no sharp "
C,Task,"angles to it . "
A,Task,"Yep comm not angular . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I'd say comm when it comes to the ergonomics comm the form and stuff comm yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . "
B,Task,"However the colour comm we don't have a say in that . "
D,Task,"Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit . "
C,Task,"Some people might say it . Yeah . "
B,Task,"That has been comm that has been dictated pretty much by the company . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh comm we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly comm definitely . "
D,Task,"That's true . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"'S nothing you can say about that . "
B,Task,"I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"Yeah something more modern to go "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"a a modern colour to go with the modern form . "
B,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"It's different . "
B,Task,"You don't want your uh three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that . "
D,Minor,"Um okay so comm "
D,Elicit,"do you think comm since we This was a a sign criteria comm do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? "
D,Elicit,"Does that sound good ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"What do you think ? "
D,Elicit,"Three ? Four ? "
A,Task,"I would say "
D,Elicit,"Five ? "
A,Task,"four . "
D,Elicit,"Four is fair . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Very non-committal comm four . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"the second one . "
D,Elicit,"Did we make it simple for new users ? "
B,Task,"It's very intuitive comm I think yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think that was the main aim comm one of the main aims that we had . "
B,Task,"S give it a one . "
D,Elicit,"One comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"'kay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? "
C,Task,"Uh yeah . "
D,Minor,"I'd say that "
C,Task,"'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common comm which are channel and volume . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And then the other ones are just a matter of just going comm just scrolling further . "
A,Task,"S scrolling through and selecting a few . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
D,Elicit,"So one ? "
B,Task,"So that's a one . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"I think that's a one . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay "
D,Task,"um the fourth one . "
D,Elicit,"How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? "
D,Task,"One of the number one complaints . "
B,Task,"Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Whether you want to or not comm you're not gonna lose it . "
C,Task,"It's bright yellow . "
C,Task,"Bright yellow's hard to lose . "
C,Task,"But um if we were to comm if we were comm that comm the speech recognition . That comm we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . "
C,Task,"That was what we'd we'd mentioned . "
A,Elicit,"So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could "
C,Task,"Just just to use comm to find it when it was lost . "
C,Task,"But like I said comm like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . "
B,Other,"Oops . "
C,Task,"And it's not gonna fall comm like a rectangle would slip down behind things . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"That's gonna be a difficult shape to "
B,Minor,"Well what "
A,Task,"And it is quite bright "
A,Minor,"and "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Maybe in the middle again comm three or four or something ? "
B,Minor,"S "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"I mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose comm I mean a million ways . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it . "
D,Task,"That's true . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"But if we do go with the comm with the speech recognition comm then it comm then our scale goes up quite a bit I think . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Oh yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"You probably "
A,Task,"Probably two . "
A,Minor,"You know . "
A,Task,"If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I'd say two . "
A,Task,"With the speech recognition comm which of course may be changed depending on budget . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Y you could add an extra feature actually . "
B,Task,"Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far . "
A,Task,"Which comm which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah true . "
C,Task,"But I mean d just those whistling comm clapping key rings you have . They're cheap . "
D,Other,"Annoying alarm or something ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"It's it's "
C,Task,"So it can't be that "
B,Minor,"Um the "
B,Task,"it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff comm "
C,Task,"expensive . "
A,Task,"Some sort of proximity "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage comm another piece that starts beeping . "
B,Task,"That can't cost much . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide comm "
B,Task,"so you have one piece comm you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your T_V_ and the other "
C,Task,"stick it on the T_V_ . "
A,Task,"Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . "
B,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"That'd be tough then . "
B,Task,"Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So . "
D,Elicit,"Are we adding one of these two features ? "
B,Task,"Let's add one of those features and say yes . "
D,Minor,"gonna say "
D,Task,"okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So we're back to a one ? "
D,Elicit,"Or a two ? "
C,Task,"Two . "
B,Task,"Two . "
D,Task,"Two comm 'kay . "
A,Task,"Two . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Are we technologically innovative ? "
B,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"I'd say so . "
C,Task,"Uh don't get many mo remote controls with "
B,Minor,"It's all just "
C,Task,"screens on . "
B,Task,"It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to "
C,Task,"Yeah it's stolen technology . "
D,Task,"From iPod yeah . "
A,Minor,"It's "
C,Minor,"But we have . "
A,Task,"But there's not a lot of yellow comm there's not a lotta yellow . "
D,Task,"But for remotes "
B,Minor,"right "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Course that wasn't really "
C,Minor,"Fa "
B,Minor,"right "
B,Minor,"right right . "
A,Task,"we were kinda forced to take that colour . "
D,Elicit,"Two ? Three ? "
A,Task,"I don't know that we are that innovative comm to tell you the truth . "
C,Task,"'cause it's stolen . "
C,Task,"No maybe not . "
B,Task,"Yeah not really . "
D,Elicit,"But how many remotes do you see like this ? "
D,Task,"Not so many . "
A,Task,"If we added the screaming factor then we go up . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Um I would say we're probably at four . "
D,Other,"Really ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"That's gonna hurt us . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Um spongy material ? "
B,Task,"Yeah well you have that comm kind of comm sort of . "
A,Task,"We have some spongy comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah as much as as needed comm I think . "
D,Task,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"It's not a one though . "
A,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"One would be the whole thing "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Because it's only got what comm these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back . "
B,Task,"to fold and stuff . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So that's a four at most . "
A,Task,"Probably a four at most . "
D,Task,"And lastly comm "
A,Task,"Possibly even a five . "
D,Elicit,"did we put the fashion in electronics ? "
B,Task,"Y yes . "
D,Task,"I'd say we did . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda comm you betcha . "
B,Minor,"More "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour comm "
C,Minor,"On the "
A,Task,"It's true . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"but it definitely is "
C,Task,"Be what we were told comm and they'd say yeah comm definitely . "
B,Minor,". "
D,Task,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Task,"Now we just gotta calculate . "
D,Other,"Six eight twelve sixteen . "
D,Other,"Seventeen divided by s "
A,Minor,"Seven is "
C,Minor,". "
D,Other,"Eight . "
A,Minor,"Two point "
A,Elicit,"two point four ? "
C,Elicit,"Is that some long division ? "
C,Elicit,"No . "
D,Task,"Well I haven't done math in years . "
A,Minor,"Something . "
D,Task,"What two "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
C,Minor,"Just comm I'm sure there's a . "
D,Task,"Okay we'll say two point four two . "
D,Elicit,"Right ? "
D,Elicit,"How does that look ? "
B,Task,"I'm impressed . "
B,Task,"I can't do that without a calculator . "
C,Task,"No I can't do long "
D,Task,"It's been a while . "
C,Task,"very impressive . "
A,Elicit,"And what what is the acceptable criteria ? "
A,Elicit,"Is there like a scale that we have to hit ? "
D,Task,"Oh no . "
D,Task,"They just told me to "
D,Task,"pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically . "
A,Task,"Alright then . "
D,Task,"So that's that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Well comm let's see . "
A,Task,"Now we get to do the budget numbers . "
A,Task,"You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . "
A,Task,"But we do . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Yeah . Yeah so . "
C,Task,"You'd been going a long time dividing that . "
C,Task,"It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . "
D,Other,"Oh my god . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Two point four two basically . "
D,Task,"Yeah we'll go with that . "
D,Task,"Not too shabby . "
A,Minor,"So I have here an "
B,Other,"Fifty percent comm you're kidding . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"P "
A,Task,"We want a fifty percent profit on this . "
A,Task,"Oh you can't really see that very well . "
C,Other,"Charge about three hundred quid for it . "
A,Task,"Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
B,Task,"It's too much . "
A,Other,"Well let's see . "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"The f the "
A,Other,"Wonder if I can make this "
B,Minor,"Uh "
A,Other,"What the "
A,Other,"Oh it won't let me do that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Alright so at top comm I don't know if you guys can read that or not . "
A,Task,"I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on comm "
A,Task,"but so we've got the energy source . "
A,Task,"There's uh four comm five comm six categories . "
B,Task,"Battery . "
A,Task,"We have energy source comm electronics comm case . "
A,Task,"Then we have case material supplements comm interface type comm and then button supplements . "
A,Minor,"Okay so "
A,Task,"Uh first of all energy source comm we picked battery . "
A,Elicit,"Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? "
A,Task,"Probably "
A,Task,"some e either two or four . "
B,Task,"Two . "
A,Elicit,"Two ? "
A,Task,"Like it . "
B,Task,"At four it's gonna be too heavy comm "
B,Task,"so that that's not our problem . "
B,Task,"People can change it every month . "
B,Task,"They won't know until after they bought it . "
A,Task,"Excellent . "
A,Task,"This is consumerism . "
A,Minor,"Alright so "
A,Task,"for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print comm regular chip-on-print comm advanced chip-on-print comm sample sensor comm sample speaker . "
B,Minor,". "
C,Elicit,"We're advanced chip are we ? "
B,Task,"That's the advanced chip-on-print comm yeah . "
A,Task,"'Kay comm "
A,Task,"we have one of those . "
A,Task,"'Kay then the case is a Probably it's double curved . "
B,Task,"Double curved comm yes . "
A,Elicit,"Case materials are "
B,Task,"Plastic . "
A,Task,"plastic . "
A,Task,"Um I guess it's two comm since one for the top comm one for the bottom . "
B,Task,"N no . "
A,Elicit,"Is that right or is it just one ? "
B,Task,"No that's just one . "
A,Task,"Maybe it's one because of the "
B,Task,"It's just one mo single mould comm we can do that . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero comm "
A,Task,"which is nice . "
B,Task,"Exactly comm right . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Elicit,"Special colour ? "
B,Task,"That's not a special colour . "
D,Task,"Bright yellow . "
B,Task,"It's a specially ugly colour comm but it's not special . "
A,Task,"Interface type . We have pushbutton comm scroll-wheel interface comm integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton comm and an L_C_D_ display . "
C,Minor,"S "
B,Minor,"S "
C,Minor,"That's "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So we actually have the L_C_D_ display "
C,Minor,"And then "
A,Elicit,"and then is it the integrated or is it "
C,Task,"I'd say the integrated . "
B,Task,"Yes unfortunately . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"Button supplement ? Special colour ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"Um special form ? Special material . "
B,Task,"We could of course make the buttons wood . "
B,Task,"Say mahogany or so "
D,Task,"It'd look really lovely . "
A,Task,"Or titanium . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm or titanium . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"They cost us all the same . "
C,Task,"remote control . "
B,Minor,"Uh just "
A,Task,"Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged comm "
A,Task,"we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements . "
C,Task,"No "
C,Minor,"that's getting a bit "
C,Minor,"tiny . "
A,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I'd ignore that . "
D,Task,"Leave it blank . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . "
A,Task,"So our total is fifteen point five . "
A,Task,"Which I believe is "
B,Task,"Yeah that's too much . "
A,Task,"by three Euros over . "
B,Task,"It's hard to believe . "
B,Task,"So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? "
A,Task,"So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake . "
C,Minor,"If it w "
C,Task,"What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . "
C,Task,"And just had a scroll wheel interface . "
C,Task,"And the L_C_D_ display . "
C,Task,"I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"'cause the "
A,Elicit,"Well 'cause we have to have both right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"I mean let's let's face it comm "
B,Task,"it also depends on the software on the on the television . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So s yeah let's take away the "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ? "
C,Task,"Uh that is possible yeah . "
B,Task,"Right . We may not need it . "
B,Other,"There you go . "
A,Other,"Well there we go . "
B,Task,"Perfect . "
C,Other,"There we go . "
A,Task,"Twelve point five . "
D,Task,"Perfect . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So we just remove our "
C,Task,"Screen . "
A,Task,"screen here . "
C,Task,"Make it a bigger dial . "
C,Task,"Easier to use . "
C,Task,"Even easier to use then . "
A,Task,"Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm the "
A,Other,"Back to the design room boys . "
B,Task,"So we can just take away a heck of a lot of the "
D,Minor,". "
B,Other,"there you go . "
D,Elicit,"What's the blue part ? "
B,Other,"central ? "
C,Minor,"That was just "
D,Task,"Oh that's the batteries . "
B,Minor,"Oh that's just "
