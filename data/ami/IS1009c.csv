A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Hello everyone . "
C,Other,"Hi . "
D,Other,"Hi . "
B,Other,"Hi . "
A,Other,"Um how uh how we doing ? "
C,Other,"Yeah comm good . "
A,Task,"Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting comm more or less . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working comm "
A,Task,"meaning gathering i suggestions "
A,Task,"from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given . "
A,Task,"Uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . "
A,Task,"Um it's also an item that people lose a lot . "
A,Task,"So we should address that . "
A,Task,"And comm of course comm it should be something s s that is very simple to use . "
A,Task,"In addition to that to make it sell comm of course comm uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive comm "
A,Task,"or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another "
A,Task,"so that the people are buying it now because comm in particular with smaller items comm that's a very important fact comm "
A,Task,"'cause um if they say comm well comm I go home and think about it comm that won't work . "
A,Task,"Um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve . "
A,Task,"And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip "
A,Task,"that has infra-red bits "
A,Task,"and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . "
A,Task,"Therefore comm messages uh will be controlled in the same manner . "
A,Task,"There should be extra features like lid buttons comm maybe a beep . If too many buttons are pressed comm "
A,Task,"mm uh uh child lock "
A,Task,"um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um you could see the time comm you know comm what show they want to watch . "
A,Task,"Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes . "
A,Task,"So the components of the thing should be button comm bulbs comm infra infra-red bulbs comm battery comm chips comm wires comm "
A,Task,"and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item . "
A,Task,"Francino who is our um "
B,Task,"Interface designer . "
A,Task,"interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it comm of course comm should have an on-off button comm "
A,Task,"and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . "
A,Task,"Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable . "
A,Task,"It should be compact . "
A,Task,"Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped . "
A,Task,"And maybe have an anar alarm-clock . "
A,Task,"And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . "
A,Task,"Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . "
A,Task,"Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature . "
A,Task,"And even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think that pretty much is it . Yeah . Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"then we I'm looking for three presentations . "
A,Task,"And uh I don't know whether the order matters much uh comm "
A,Task,"I don't I don't think so comm "
A,Elicit,"so whoever w wants "
B,Other,"Okay comm I can start first . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Now my slide comm please . "
A,Other,"Okay comm your slides . Okay . "
A,Other,"Oh comm come on comm close already . "
A,Elicit,"And that's number two comm right ? "
B,Task,"Three . "
A,Other,"Three . "
B,Task,"Participant three . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Now as an interface designer comm I would give more emphasis on the interface comm how the remote looks like "
B,Task,"so that it is sellable comm it is attractive to customers . "
B,Task,"Next comm please . "
B,Task,"Okay . Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . "
B,Task,"This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel comm "
B,Task,"like you can have the numbers one comm two comm three comm four comm up to nine . "
A,Elicit,"Nine what ? Nine channel uh switches ? "
B,Other,"Pardon me ? "
A,Elicit,"Nine channel switches ? "
A,Minor,"Is "
B,Task,"Yes comm nine numbers . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And then you have swapping of uh button "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . "
B,Task,"Then it should have a next button comm "
B,Task,"and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one . "
C,Task,"Going to the nex next . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Next slide comm please . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Then comm there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . "
B,Task,"For example comm if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English comm then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the the subtitles on the screen . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour comm colour of the picture comm the contrast comm sharpness comm brightness of the picture . "
B,Task,"Now there should be a memory switch . "
B,Task,"There should be a mute button . "
B,Task,"Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call comm and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_ comm but he he can reduce the sound comm "
B,Task,"he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the T_V_ . "
B,Task,"Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . "
B,Task,"It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . "
B,Task,"So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers comm you can record your own voice "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television comm "
B,Task,"for example comm if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel comm uh th now the the uh yeah comm the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . "
B,Task,"So this is one one of the interface which can be created . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features . "
B,Task,"Then comm please comm next slide . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Then comm these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour comm but they have many buttons . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . "
B,Task,"So you can you can design an interface which is very simple comm and which is user-friendly . "
B,Task,"Even a kid can use that . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So can you go on t t uh to the next slide . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And this has multi-purpose use comm it can be used for T_V_ comm it can be used for cable-satellite comm it can be used for V_C_R_ comm D_V_D_s and audio . "
B,Task,"And this has in-built voice recogniser . "
B,Task,"Can you go on to the next slide ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Uh this is user-friendly comm it's very attractive "
B,Task,"and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it . "
B,Task,"And this comes with different colours comm different shapes . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons "
B,Task,"and all the important uh buttons are there in this small comm compact comm "
B,Task,"attractive child interface . "
B,Task,"Next slide comm please . "
B,Task,"Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace . "
D,Other,"You don't know me . "
B,Minor,"this . "
D,Other,"I could lose that in a minute . "
B,Minor,"So this is "
B,Task,"No this is a very big comm you cannot misplace it anywhere . "
B,Task,"So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"This i this is one such interface which can be created . "
B,Task,"And the personal preference uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Other,"Thank you comm "
B,Minor,"that's "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Okay comm thank you very much . "
A,Elicit,"Uh any comments on uh her presentation ? "
D,Task,"Well comm um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Um what uh I'm "
D,Task,"No suggestion's bad . "
B,Minor,"Mm yes . "
D,Task,"But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more . "
D,Minor,"I don't think that we can get uh "
D,Task,"The T-shape is good comm the child one is good comm "
D,Task,"the too big to misplace comm I think it's just funny . "
D,Task,"Um I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm I I th I think "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy . "
A,Task,"No comm I think the these are her presentations comm but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after "
D,Minor,"Yeah mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Have to come back to that later . Okay . "
B,Minor,"We can . "
A,Minor,"but if "
A,Elicit,"I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation . "
D,Task,"No comm I think her presentation was good comm and she really explored all the options . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm right . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Ho who wants to go next um ? "
C,Other,"Yeah comm maybe . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"and you "
C,Task,"Participant two . "
A,Task,"Uh okay . "
C,Task,"Uh the next one comm sorry . "
A,Other,"Oops . "
C,Task,"It's it was the old one . "
C,Task,"Components . "
A,Other,"The components design . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
C,Other,"Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh comm can you go on to the next slide comm please . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"I have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction . "
C,Task,"Uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit comm battery comm etcetera comm etcetera comm "
C,Minor,"it's like "
C,Task,"Uh it can be a plastic one comm "
C,Task,"hard plastic comm so that it can be strong comm "
C,Task,"even if you just uh uh comm you know comm if you if it falls down comm then it doesn't break . "
C,Task,"So it should be strong . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that . "
C,Task,"And it should be recyclable . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Uh and uh comm "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . Good point . "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"and also uh using of colouring compon components "
C,Task,"like uh if we want to have different colours comm blue comm red comm green comm so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components . "
C,Task,"And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit . "
C,Task,"Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . "
C,Task,"If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . "
C,Task,"And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures . "
C,Task,"Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside comm it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures . "
C,Task,"And uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility . "
C,Task,"And the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor "
C,Task,"uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through through through the uh remote controller "
C,Task,"and uh also a capacitor "
C,Task,"which is a b which is a m I think it's it's like a battery comm capacitor . "
C,Task,"Can you go on to the next slide comm please ? "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh a diode comm a transistor comm a resonator comm "
C,Task,"these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . "
C,Task,"A battery "
C,Other,"uh comm I would like to suggest one thing "
C,Minor,"uh if we "
C,Task,"uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much . "
C,Task,"It it it's not a high voltage battery . "
C,Task,"Then also we can If it is a rechargeable one comm then uh people can use it for a long time comm "
C,Task,"so in that way we can cut cut the cost comm but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . "
C,Task,"And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller . "
C,Task,"Can you go to the next slide comm please . "
C,Task,"And how it works comm how the remote controller works . "
A,Other,"Go away . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Task,"Uh when you press a button comm when you do that comm you complete a specific connection "
C,Task,"that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button comm and it will send some signals through the wires comm "
C,Task,"and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . "
C,Task,"Suppose you have pressed channel one button comm number one you have pressed comm then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed . "
C,Task,"It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . "
C,Task,"Every button comm every individual button comm has its own morse code . "
C,Task,"Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one comm then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button comm "
C,Task,"and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . "
C,Task,"Like you have got a signal by pressing a button . "
C,Task,"That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . "
C,Task,"Now comm that signal comm that morse code comm has to be amplified by the transistor . "
C,Task,"That is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . "
C,Task,"It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . "
C,Task,"The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light comm and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately comm "
C,Task,"that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal comm then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do . "
C,Task,"Then it will do the appropriate action . "
C,Task,"So uh this is how the remote controller works . "
B,Minor,"It works . "
C,Task,"Can you go to the next slide comm please . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I have few pictures . "
C,Minor,"When you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's it "
C,Task,"this is a normal remote controller . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And to the next slide comm please . "
C,Task,"And where we had a a few buttons and all . "
C,Task,"And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and also a capac uh a capacitor comm three resistors and also a resonator "
C,Minor,"uh um mm yeah comm "
C,Task,"and di and a diode transistor . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"The electronic components "
C,Task,"uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d diode transistors an "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm di um can y uh "
C,Task,"you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm yes . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and uh just beside that you can see a transistor comm "
C,Task,"and a uh uh cylinder shape comm uh that one is a capacitor . "
C,Task,"Uh and also there are uh um resistors "
C,Task,"uh sorry comm ther there is a diode . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Can you go go on to the next slide . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So uh this is the circuit board . "
C,Task,"The green one is a circuit board . "
C,Task,"Actually comm uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive . "
C,Task,"Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper comm "
C,Task,"because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires comm it's it's better to go for printing comm "
C,Task,"because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing comm nothing like uh comm you know comm you don't need to use wires and all . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"It's not exactly wires we are using . "
C,Task,"It's just printing something on a board . "
C,Task,"Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits . "
C,Task,"So th that green uh thing is a circuit board comm "
C,Task,"and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons comm "
C,Task,"like when you press a button comm the circuit under the button will be activated "
C,Minor,"uh th it will "
C,Task,"it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the comm yeah comm um integrated circuit . "
B,Minor,"Transmit . "
C,Task,"Can you go to the next slide comm please . "
C,Minor,"Uh so this is "
C,Task,"these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . "
C,Elicit,"Uh can you see the black uh comm round marks ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"They they are the circuits . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Next comm please . "
C,Task,"And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . "
C,Task,"Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it comm but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery comm a more ingenious uh hard dynamo comm um a kinetic provision of energy comm "
C,Task,"more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . So that also we can have in a battery comm "
C,Task,"uh or we can use solar sells . "
D,Task,"Hmm comm that's interesting . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases . "
C,Task,"Uh usually comm the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And you have more pictures . "
A,Task,"Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm maybe d uh I have just one more slide comm I think . Um . "
C,Task,"Like we can have a ma material such as plastic comm rubber comm wood comm titanium comm "
C,Task,"but titanium we can't use . "
C,Task,"Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print comm "
C,Task,"um also infra it includes the infrared se sender . "
C,Task,"Um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker . "
C,Task,"An Yeah comm that's it . "
C,Task,"It's all for me now comm "
C,Other,"thank you . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"well thank you . "
A,Elicit,"Any particular comments by anybody ? "
D,Elicit,"Uh yeah comm on the scroll and the push-button comm um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ? "
C,Task,"No comm no comm no comm th the the the scrolling wheels are different comm "
C,Task,"like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls comm uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before comm I think . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Now comm nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all . "
C,Task,"So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"We'll just go for push buttons "
C,Task,"Yeah uh yeah comm push-buttons . Yeah . "
D,Task,"for in the interest of cost . "
B,Minor,"Push-buttons . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We don't have a lot of time left "
A,Task,"and we will still have to make a decision comm "
A,Task,"and the marketing expert has to present her her thing . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Go right to my first my next slide . "
A,Other,"Uh okay . "
D,Task,"Um alright comm my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing comm and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition comm "
D,Task,"so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . "
D,Task,"I s I spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . "
D,Task,"And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that comm I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have comm "
D,Task,"and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . "
D,Task,"And I would encourage you all to do the same . "
D,Task,"Um and my findings from this is that comm you know comm small is beautiful . "
D,Task,"Um people like something that really fits in their hand . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"Simple is beautiful . "
D,Task,"They don't want to have to squint at small print um comm "
D,Task,"they want buttons whose functions are obvious comm and they want um as few buttons as possible comm "
D,Task,"and they don't care for the mode thing . "
D,Task,"They want each button to do something . "
D,Task,"And eye-catching is important . "
D,Task,"It's gotta look cute comm it's gotta look appealing . "
D,Task,"Go ahead comm "
D,Other,"I'm trying to finish fast for you . "
D,Task,"Um and our preference is comm as far as I'm concerned comm are we got to get to the market before the competition . "
D,Task,"Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others comm "
D,Task,"so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item . "
D,Task,"And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . "
D,Task,"If we try to tell people it has too many great features comm um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . "
D,Task,"So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things comm I think comm that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . "
D,Task,"And I've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular . "
D,Task,"And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . "
D,Task,"And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . "
D,Task,"They are more back into soft feel comm spongy feeling things comm things with maybe a little cloth on them . "
D,Task,"So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Uh that concludes the presentation of everyone . "
A,Task,"And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"And uh so what do we think on the concept "
A,Elicit,"of the remote ? "
D,Task,"You wanna try to come back to yours comm and limit yours a bit ? "
B,Other,"Uh yes comm "
A,Minor,"Y "
B,Task,"I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm but w "
B,Task,"This could be uh one feature which could be sellable . "
D,Task,"Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I think that's "
D,Task,"That that be really good comm yeah comm I agree with that . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems comm issues . "
D,Elicit,"Distance problem ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"like maybe different people will be having different voices comm "
C,Minor,"so it like it's uh everything so i "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"Well comm you you teach You have to teach uh "
C,Task,"So to get a good recogni recognising system comm it's a costly thing comm I think . "
B,Minor,"No comm it's it's comm uh yeah comm "
B,Task,"it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already comm and then you're expecting an answer from th "
B,Task,"For example comm you have a T_V_ system comm I'm the user and my family members are the user comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I will already record uh a question like comm uh good morning comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm but "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television . "
