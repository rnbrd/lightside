D,Other,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Good morning everybody . "
A,Other,"Um I'm glad you could all come . "
A,Other,"I'm really excited to start this team . "
A,Other,"Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us comm for our kick-off meeting . "
A,Task,"My name is Rose Lindgren . "
A,Task,"I I'll be the Project Manager . "
A,Task,"Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening "
A,Task,"and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project comm "
A,Task,"then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit comm including a tool training exercise . "
A,Task,"And then we'll move into the project plan comm "
A,Task,"do a little discussion "
A,Task,"and close comm "
A,Task,"since we only have twenty five minutes . "
A,Task,"First of all our project aim . "
A,Task,"Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about comm "
A,Task,"it needs to be original comm trendy and user-friendly . "
A,Other,"I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . "
A,Task,"Um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts . "
A,Task,"First the functional design "
A,Task,"which will be uh first we'll do individual work comm "
A,Task,"come into a meeting comm "
A,Task,"the conceptional design comm individual work and a meeting comm "
A,Task,"and then the detailed design comm individual work and a meeting . "
A,Task,"So that we'll each be doing our own ideas "
A,Task,"and then coming together "
A,Task,"and um collaborating . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . "
A,Minor,"So um comm "
A,Task,"what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina . "
A,Other,"Um Alima comm "
B,Task,"Alima . "
A,Other,"sorry "
A,Other,"comm Alima . "
A,Task,"Um we're gonna do a little tool training comm "
A,Task,"so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . "
A,Task,"Um introduce yourself comm "
A,Task,"um say one thing about yourself "
A,Task,"and then draw your favourite animal "
A,Task,"and tell us about it . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me . "
A,Task,"Probably both . "
B,Minor,"Right comm so comm "
B,Task,"I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . "
B,Other,"I have no drawing skills whatsoever . "
B,Other,"But uh let's see comm introduce myself . "
B,Task,"My name is Alima Bucciantini . "
B,Task,"Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . "
B,Task,"I'm doing nationalism studies comm "
B,Other,"blah comm blah comm blah comm "
B,Other,"and I have no artistic talents . "
A,Elicit,"How do you spell your name ? "
B,Task,"A_ L_ I_ M_ A_ . "
A,Other,"Thanks . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"let's see if I can get "
B,Task,"um here . "
B,Other,"I will draw a little turtle for you all . "
B,Task,"Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal comm "
B,Task,"but just that I think they're drawable . "
B,Task,"And you have the pretty little shell going on . "
B,Task,"Some little eyes . Happy . "
B,Task,"There you go . "
B,Task,"That's a turtle . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"So what are your favourite characteristics ? "
B,Task,"Um . I I like the whole having a shell thing . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"It's quite cool carry your home around where you go comm "
B,Task,"um quite decorative little animals comm "
B,Task,"they can swim comm "
B,Minor,"they can comm "
B,Task,"they're very adaptable comm "
B,Task,"they carry everything they need with them comm "
B,Task,"um and they're easy to draw . "
A,Task,"Excellent . "
A,Elicit,"Shall we just go around the table ? "
C,Task,"Uh Okay . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"my name is Iain uh "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . Um . "
C,Other,"And I'll try and draw my favourite animal . "
C,Minor,"I'll "
C,Other,"I should leave that one on there "
B,Task,"No comm "
C,Elicit,"shouldn't I "
B,Task,"you can erase the turtle comm "
C,Other,"before I callously rub it off . "
B,Task,"it's alright . "
A,Task,"Might be nice to have them all up there at same time . "
C,Other,"Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um . "
C,Elicit,"Is that at least identifiable ? "
B,Task,"Snake . "
D,Elicit,"Well . "
C,Task,"It's a whale comm yes . "
A,Minor,"Em "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Elicit,"snake ? "
B,Minor,"It's w "
C,Other,"Thanks . "
D,Task,"Oh my god comm it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do . "
C,Minor,"Um and comm yeah comm "
C,Task,"the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're well comm first of all they're quite intelligent "
C,Task,"um and also they're they're kind of mysterious comm "
C,Task,"like we don't really know much about them "
C,Task,"or or understand how they work comm "
C,Task,"how they form groups . "
C,Task,"And I just find them interesting animals . "
D,Other,"Take my contraptions with me . "
D,Minor,"Alright comm "
D,Task,"I'm Jessy . "
D,Task,"I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ . "
D,Task,"And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on comm animal . "
D,Task,"Don't really know how to draw this . "
D,Minor,"Just where can I "
D,Other,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Maybe if I do the water comm "
D,Elicit,"but how ? "
D,Task,"Sort of give an idea . "
D,Task,"I have no idea how one would explain this . "
D,Other,"Mm maybe with some whiskers . "
D,Task,"Briefly comm it's supposed to be a seal . "
D,Task,"You can imagine it in the water . "
D,Task,"I like them comm "
D,Task,"because they are like playful and silly sort of "
D,Task,"have a good time . "
D,Other,"Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
A,Other,"Mm 'kay ? "
A,Task,"I'm Rose "
A,Task,"and I'm Project Manager comm from California . "
A,Minor,"Um . Hmm . "
A,Minor,"S "
D,Task,"It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Elicit,"a cat . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um it's actually a coyote . "
A,Minor,"Let's see . Let's see comm "
B,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"That's impressive . "
A,Other,"let's give it a little bit of a snout comm I don't know comm some teeth . "
B,Minor,"That's "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's pretty impressive . "
C,Task,"Cool . "
A,Other,"Oh dear . Yes . "
A,Task,"I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California . "
A,Task,"We have coyotes howl all the time . "
A,Task,"So I really enjoy their their singing comm "
A,Task,"you they're really beautiful animals . Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay um comm "
A,Task,"moving on to slightly more serious stuff . "
A,Task,"We're gonna talk about project finances . "
A,Minor,"Um we have a couple "
A,Task,"we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales "
A,Task,"and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet comm like it's an international market range comm "
A,Task,"we don't have to worry about specifics . "
A,Task,"Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude comm we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . "
A,Task,"So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . "
A,Minor,"Okay um comm "
A,Task,"just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um comm I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls comm "
A,Task,"um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control comm "
A,Elicit,"what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like "
A,Elicit,"what are the features that you don't like comm etcetera comm "
A,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ "
D,Task,"like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ "
D,Task,"and then like another one to get the actual screen on "
D,Task,"and something else to get it all going comm I don't know . "
D,Task,"Now they keep combining all different remotes together comm "
D,Task,"and I don't know if I necessarily like that "
D,Task,"'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . "
D,Task,"I just wanna watch the T_V_ um . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Always gets lost . "
D,Task,"Some sort of like device to help you find it . "
C,Task,"I've used comm I've used remote controls comm for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder "
C,Task,"and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . "
C,Task,"You don't have to get up "
C,Task,"and walk across the room to change a channel . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . Um . "
C,Minor,"I find them "
C,Task,"they can be a bit annoying comm "
C,Task,"especially comm like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me comm you know comm one for the T_V_ comm one for the digital box comm one for m the video recorder as well . Um . "
C,Task,"And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing comm "
C,Task,"they've got too many buttons on them "
C,Task,"uh too too sort of too sort of complicated "
C,Task,"when all I really wanna do is switch on and off comm "
C,Task,"change the channel comm "
C,Task,"change the volume . "
B,Minor,"Yeah um . "
B,Task,"I agree with having too many remotes around . "
B,Task,"My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things comm "
B,Task,"and I don't know how to work half of them um . "
B,Task,"What's important for me comm I guess comm is that it's easy to use "
B,Task,"and that there's not too many buttons comm "
B,Task,"they are not too small comm "
B,Task,"you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . "
B,Task,"And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm I think there is a way around that comm "
B,Task,"but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself comm "
B,Task,"and I think that's if we're gonna make a remote control comm it should actually work for what it's doing . "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"What about like batteries and things like that comm "
D,Elicit,"like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries "
D,Elicit,"or do all remotes require batteries ? "
A,Task,"Um I would imagine all of them comm "
B,Minor,"I know . "
A,Minor,"but we could "
A,Task,"but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery "
A,Task,"um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"something that doesn't "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . Um . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Um . Okay comm "
A,Task,"it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote comm "
A,Task,"and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . "
A,Elicit,"So how do we work with that ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Could we get something that "
B,Task,"just has "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder "
B,Task,"or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about comm "
B,Task,"but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything comm you know volume control comm on comm off comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"channel changing . "
D,Task,"And maybe that spatially divides it comm "
D,Task,"so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's comm you know comm like the top thing on the remote comm I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it comm but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here comm "
D,Task,"all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"N that way "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"'cause then you like comm I don't even know what I'm turning on . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on comm off comm channel changing comm volume comm and another rote remote with all the special things . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"So like you have to have them somewhere comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . "
B,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . "
C,Other,"Can I ask comm "
C,Elicit,"are we designing a remote control for a television only "
C,Elicit,"um comm and if if this device is just to be used for the television "
A,Task,"Good question . "
C,Elicit,"would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? "
A,Task,"I don't know that yet . "
C,Elicit,"Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"It's a good question . Um . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm hmm . "
A,Other,"I'll look into that . "
A,Other,"If I can . "
D,Task,"I think it's just T_V_ comm "
D,Minor,"I mean comm if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say . "
B,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
D,Task,"You know comm things might be more advanced than that . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well "
C,Task,"I I don't know if that works technologically or not . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . "
B,Task,"If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler comm "
B,Task,"'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It's an idea with the buttons being really . "
B,Task,"Large . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye comm it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons comm if we can help it . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . 'Kay "
A,Task,"sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . "
A,Task,"Mind if we move on ? "
A,Minor,"Ps "
C,Task,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"mm okay . "
A,Task,"Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . "
A,Task,"I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty comm "
A,Task,"so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um comm "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . "
A,Task,"Um the industrial design comm Alima will be doing um the working design . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um the User Interface Designer comm that's for . Technical functions comm I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing comm the size of the buttons . "
A,Task,"Um user requirements um comm so you'll be hearing about different trends comm uh about different things that people need comm "
A,Task,"um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having comm we'll get from the actual consum s consumers . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay um . "
A,Task,"And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . "
A,Task,"I realised in this past one we we didn't have much comm "
A,Task,"we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . "
A,Task,"Um so very exited to see all your animals "
A,Task,"and how what wonderful um artists we all are um . "
A,Elicit,"Any questions ? "
C,Elicit,"What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? "
C,Elicit,"Do we know that ? "
A,Task,"I haven't gotten an agenda yet comm "
A,Other,"um I'll put that together . "
A,Task,"I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions "
A,Task,"and then we'll come back together . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"I'm sure we'll be busy . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay um "
A,Other,"I'll type up mi minutes "
A,Other,"and probably email those out to all of you . Um just including all the things that we talked about . Um . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Can you e-mail your slides as well ? "
C,Elicit,"Is that possible ? "
A,Task,"Yes comm I yes comm I think I can . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Cool "
A,Other,"I'll just attach it to an email . "
A,Elicit,"And you're you're number two comm "
B,Task,"I'm two . "
A,Elicit,"three comm "
A,Elicit,"four ? "
D,Task,"I'm four . "
A,Elicit,"Is that correct ? "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Excellent . "
A,Other,"It was lovely meeting you all . "
C,Minor,"'Kay "
A,Task,"Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Other,"Let me see if I can do that right now . "
