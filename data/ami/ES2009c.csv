D,Other,"That went well comm "
D,Other,"thank you . "
A,Task,"That's great . "
D,Task,"Perfect . "
B,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm "
A,Other,"let me just PowerPoint this up . "
A,Minor,"Right so um "
A,Task,"this meeting will be about the conceptual design comm "
A,Task,"don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is comm "
A,Task,"it's just something important that we need to do . "
A,Task,"Um comm think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . "
A,Task,"In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . "
A,Minor,"Um . Right so um comm "
A,Other,"apologies for the last meeting comm "
A,Task,"it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough comm "
A,Other,"um comm so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . "
A,Task,"Um comm fair enough comm "
A,Other,"thanks for the input comm "
A,Task,"'s always good . Um . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time comm "
A,Task,"um comm and gonna go through you comm "
A,Elicit,"uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me "
A,Task,"um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting comm possible directions . "
A,Task,"And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic "
A,Task,"uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"perfect . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Elicit,"without th further ado comm whoever wants to go first is free to . "
B,Other,"I'll go first . "
D,Task,"Go ahead . "
A,Task,"Alright Nathan comm "
A,Task,"take it away . "
A,Elicit,"It is Nathan right ? "
A,Elicit,"I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"Nathan's fine . "
A,Task,"Good . "
B,Task,"It's either Nathan or participant two . "
C,Other,"Mister participant two that is . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Nice . "
B,Minor,"Okay . Um comm "
A,Task,"Nice . "
B,Task,"basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design "
B,Task,"and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do "
B,Task,"because of what our manufacturer offers comm "
B,Minor,"so "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . "
B,Task,"Um comm components of a remote control comm okay . We've already kind of gone over this "
B,Task,"but we're gonna have to get into more detail "
B,Task,"and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . "
B,Task,"Energy source comm um comm our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources comm your standard battery comm solar cells . "
B,Task,"Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium "
B,Minor,"so we might have to look "
B,Task,"if we do go that route comm we might have to look elsewhere . "
B,Task,"Um comm and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . "
B,Task,"Basically comm it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . "
B,Task,"So that's one possibility "
B,Task,"but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"So we'll have to look into that . "
B,Task,"Um comm the case comm we have a few options comm plastic comm rubber or wood . "
B,Task,"Um and then as far as the way it's shaped comm we can do standard boring flat comm "
B,Task,"which we probably don't wanna do comm "
B,Task,"curved or very sexy double curved . "
A,Elicit,"What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? "
B,Task,"Um comm I imagine that we could specify . "
B,Task,"Um comm I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"brilliant . "
B,Task,"Um comm the buttons comm there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer comm "
B,Task,"but to use those we'd have to use more chips comm "
B,Task,"um and that would cost us more . "
B,Task,"And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons "
B,Task,"because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Um and just a little note there comm "
B,Task,"touch screen equals many chips "
B,Task,"which equals many Euro . "
D,Other,"Right . "
D,Task,"Nice . "
B,Task,"Um comm one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . "
B,Task,"So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it "
B,Task,"but in fact there is light coming out of the remote "
B,Task,"and you know the television can detect that . "
B,Minor,"And if you were to record "
B,Task,"if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . "
B,Task,"Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting "
B,Task,"was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote comm just kind of as a fun gimmick . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . "
D,Task,"Interesting . "
B,Task,"Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that . "
D,Task,"Mm . Good call . "
A,Minor,"M Maybe "
A,Task,"is there an option that we can have that off or on "
A,Task,"so a person can select like "
D,Task,"Choose it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I am sure that we could do that . "
B,Minor,"Um comm of course "
A,Task,"Yeah I like the idea comm "
A,Task,"it's a good idea . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"just as a fun gimmick . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Just to set us apart a little bit . "
B,Task,"Um comm and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use comm also known as the chip . "
B,Task,"Uh comm we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . "
B,Task,"Um findings comm "
B,Minor,"okay comm "
B,Task,"we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer comm "
B,Elicit,"um and my question to all of you is comm should we look to other manufacturies "
B,Elicit,"or should we just make do with what we have available ? "
C,Task,"Interesting question . "
B,Task,"'S a bit of a challenge question . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"I'd say shop around "
D,Elicit,"but with our time constraints comm is that really a feasible option ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Right comm that's my concern too . "
B,Task,"Um comm if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . "
B,Minor,"My personal preference is "
B,Other,"I'll just throw my cards on the table comm "
B,Task,"uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route comm "
B,Task,"just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . "
B,Task,"Uh comm I like the idea of the visible light signalling comm "
B,Task,"that's something to set us apart "
B,Task,"and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . "
B,Task,"So we're not so confined by one style "
B,Minor,"and say some you know comm say our the one "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"Can we do marketing piloting too ? "
A,Task,"Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ? "
D,Task,"Um It's an option comm "
D,Task,"uh but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now "
A,Minor,"Okay . Okay . "
D,Task,"which actually might even come into play beforehand comm "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway . "
A,Task,"perfect . "
A,Task,"Great comm "
A,Other,"thank you very much Nathan . "
B,Other,"Oh yeah comm you're welcome . "
A,Task,"That's perfect comm "
A,Task,"so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . "
D,Task,"I guess so comm "
D,Task,"'cause I found some interesting things . "
D,Elicit,"You waiting for me ? "
A,Other,"Fascinating comm compelling even . "
C,Other,"Did you ? "
D,Task,"I know comm "
D,Other,"what a teaser ain't it . "
D,Minor,"Um . Right . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"current market trends . "
D,Other,"Screen . "
D,Task,"Um comm basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now "
D,Task,"and what's going on in other design fields comm "
D,Task,"to see sort of what's what's trendy comm what's new comm what's happening . "
D,Task,"Um comm remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer comm fancier comm more exciting "
D,Task,"they're sick of this boring comm normal comm functional comm "
D,Task,"um that we need innovative design options "
D,Task,"and there needs to be an easy user interface . "
D,Task,"Um the challenge is that current trends right now comm across the board in fashion comm in furniture comm in technology comm is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . "
D,Task,"Now I'm not saying we should have comm you know comm tomato shaped remote controls or anything comm "
D,Task,"but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours comm "
D,Task,"like if wood is an option comm that whole organic comm sleek comm clean comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"v line thing may be something we can look into . "
D,Task,"Different skin options comm "
D,Task,"or if we can't afford this touch plate thing comm or touch face screen interface um comm maybe having the b images be specific comm "
D,Task,"like you could choose your menu bullets to be "
A,Other,"Tomatoes . "
D,Task,"a different shape "
D,Other,"or okay comm "
D,Task,"not the example I would choose comm "
D,Task,"but you know what I mean to t sort of "
D,Task,"and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"uh not something I I've come up with a "
C,Task,"I like it comm I like it . "
D,Task,"though if we can get around to getting piloting comm I thought maybe a casing option like uh "
D,Task,"not like a skin comm but like a holder almost if you could do like um comm leather options or wood options or something "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Other,"I should have mentioned this um . "
B,Task,"As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"it has a consistency of those stress balls . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Might be an interesting way to go . "
C,Task,"Fabulous . "
A,Task,"Slick comm slick . "
D,Minor,"Um comm yeah so "
D,Task,"something to sit on for now . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"overall I think we should stick with what we're finding comm "
D,Task,"everyone's looking for easy to use comm technologically innovative and this fancy new "
D,Task,"I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
A,Minor,"Interface comm oh the interface graphics for the um "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um . Well "
D,Minor,"I d "
D,Task,"but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I like the idea of of rubber too "
B,Task,"because it's tends to be associated with being durable comm "
B,Task,"something that you can drop and it doesn't matter . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"True . "
B,Minor,"'Cause so many "
B,Task,"you go to so many houses these days "
B,Task,"and you see broken remote controls . "
D,Task,"Very true . Very true . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's like comm yep "
B,Task,"Taped with duck tape and what have you comm "
D,Task,"Very much so . Um "
B,Task,"you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber . "
A,Task,"it's ubiquitous "
C,Task,"We can have a duck tape casing . "
A,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
D,Task,"We could . "
D,Task,"I think that goes against the whole fancy something comm a new line comm "
D,Task,"but worth a shot . "
C,Other,"It could go with the granola crowd . "
D,Other,"Ah comm "
D,Task,"it could be comm it could be comm "
D,Minor,"um . Yeah "
D,Task,"that's what I know . "
A,Task,"Great comm "
A,Other,"thanks for that Sarah . "
D,Other,"No problem . "
A,Task,"Ron ? "
C,Other,"Phew . "
C,Task,"Computer's adjusting . "
C,Task,"One moment please . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"interme "
C,Task,"interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . "
C,Task,"So yur user interface comm guys comm is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear comm or otherwise uh perceive . "
C,Task,"Uh comm commands and mechanisms comm that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . "
C,Task,"Here's a d series of different remote controls "
C,Task,"that are out on the market today . "
C,Task,"I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"Um comm so "
C,Task,"the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . "
C,Task,"Uh voice recognition comm we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team "
C,Other,"but uh I'll get to that in a moment . "
C,Minor,"Um comm so "
C,Task,"current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples comm "
C,Task,"um and basically you record your own verbal labels "
C,Task,"c and connect them to the remote control . "
C,Minor,"Now "
C,Task,"our design team comm research team comm has been able to uh set up a system "
C,Task,"in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses . "
C,Task,"Like you could say good morning uh remote control "
C,Task,"and it'll say in a sexy female voice comm Good morning Joe . Um . "
C,Task,"In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team "
C,Task,"On the remote control "
D,Task,"Yeah . Very true comm very true . "
A,Minor,"at the "
C,Task,"right . "
C,Task,"Um comm another concept is what uh Apple has come up with comm the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"which I am sure most of you know about . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button comm kind of like a modern a bit bulky comm a bit crazy comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I don't think that's we're necessarily going for . "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"And uh some special components comm uh ideas like uh blocking comm having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming "
C,Task,"but uh I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um "
C,Task,"and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here . "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"I can see . "
C,Task,"Um comm again probably not what we're going for "
C,Task,"so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . "
C,Task,"Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package "
C,Task,"to kind of set the idea that you can change it "
D,Task,"Mm comm right . "
C,Task,"and you can try changing it "
C,Task,"and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one "
C,Task,"which can add value to our uh bottom line . "
C,Task,"Uh touch screen interface comm um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system "
C,Task,"so those don't move away from the screen comm uh comm the important ones like power comm volume and jump between channels . "
C,Task,"Um comm and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"red for power comm um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea "
C,Task,"like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank "
C,Task,"has jokes when it's ready . "
D,Task,"Nice . "
A,Task,"Great . "
C,Task,"And uh that is about it . "
A,Task,"Great comm wonderful Ron comm cool . "
A,Task,"Lot of good ideas comm good facts to have . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"That's what they need comm it's like a little dongle "
A,Task,"it just sticks up this further "
A,Task,"so you don't have to stand up every time comm "
A,Task,"just connect it comm my kingdom . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Right so comm "
A,Task,"good to know all that stuff comm "
A,Other,"thanks guys comm um . "
A,Task,"Now we kind of have to come to some decisions comm "
A,Task,"um comm I figure we can just go down the line "
A,Task,"and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . "
A,Elicit,"Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think comm I dunno comm what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? "
D,Task,"I think it's our most marketable feature "
D,Task,"just because it's so new "
D,Task,"and it's something that is showing up in other places . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Elicit,"But can we really afford it "
D,Task,"'cause it looks like they would be comm that would be a really main cost source then "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote comm "
A,Elicit,"To produce each one . "
D,Elicit,"Per ? "
B,Task,"yeah "
B,Task,"that's just an estimate though . "
D,Task,"Piece . "
C,Other,"Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects . "
D,Task,"I know "
A,Other,"Mm . "
C,Other,"You industrial designers . "
B,Task,"I know . "
B,Task,"It's fun . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
D,Elicit,"And our goal was to be under twelve fifty "
D,Elicit,"or we have to be under twelve fifty ? "
A,Minor,"Well . "
D,Elicit,"Do we remember ? "
B,Task,"I thought there was some flexibility with that . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"There is comm "
A,Task,"it's just comm it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . "
D,Elicit,"Can we justify it ? "
A,Task,"Um comm from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five . "
A,Task,"If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? "
B,Task,"That's just off the top of my head comm "
B,Task,"it is pending further emails . "
A,Task,"From the board comm "
B,Task,"Right . "
A,Minor,"um comm well "
D,Task,"Though I think that's what people would pay for comm "
D,Task,"I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote comm you're gonna expect it to do something "
A,Task,"That's true comm "
A,Minor,"I mean "
B,Minor,"It is the new "
B,Task,"it would be in a class of its own . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"And that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market "
A,Task,"we're not going for mass any you know comm mass sales anyway comm "
A,Minor,"we're gonna make "
A,Task,"I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things comm "
A,Task,"we just couldn't comm not for twenty-five Euros comm "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins "
A,Task,"rather than selling for twenty five comm sell 'em for thirty comm "
A,Task,"but that's something that we can have finance deal with . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um comm I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen "
A,Elicit,"or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? "
C,Task,"I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea "
C,Task,"and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production comm "
D,Task,"See if we can cut some corners . "
C,Minor,"my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh "
D,Minor,"Right . Well "
D,Task,"and we can look into this other manufacturing option comm "
D,Task,"and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's true . "
B,Task,"We could initially go with what we have "
B,Task,"and if we can find them cheaper later on "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"It's a starting point anyway comm "
D,Minor,"so . "
A,Minor,"No "
A,Task,"we could have a s very simple touch screen comm you know comm "
A,Task,"there's always the opportunity comm "
A,Task,"if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever comm you know comm w we yeah comm I guess we can play around with it a bit . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm "
A,Task,"let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I mean I think that we really have two main selling points comm "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"'cause with voice recognition "
C,Task,"I think that our casing and the voice recognition "
D,Task,"I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"The voice rec thing comm "
A,Task,"I mean comm if if we're looking at bottom line comm now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on comm "
A,Task,"I think we might have to drop the voice rec . "
D,Task,"I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"To be honest comm we have the capa we have the design in-house comm "
D,Task,"Price-wise . "
C,Task,"I mean we've we've come up with this comm with this new voice "
D,Task,"True . "
C,Task,"we're using it for our coffee machines already . "
D,Task,"We've already got it . "
C,Other,"I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall . "
C,Task,"Sounds good . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
A,Elicit,"What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ? "
B,Task,"I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up "
B,Task,"um but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . "
D,Task,"Pretty much . "
B,Task,"It would be very nice . "
C,Task,"I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . "
D,Task,"Right "
D,Task,"and they said they wanted voice recognition . "
D,Task,"Course comm maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option comm "
D,Task,"but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition "
D,Task,"so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Does having both really up our costs ? "
A,Task,"I can't see how it wouldn't comm "
A,Task,"I mean comm there's you know the old aphorism comm "
A,Task,"you can have it fast comm "
A,Task,"you can have it cheap "
A,Task,"or you can have it quality comm "
A,Task,"pick two of three . "
A,Task,"You know comm you can't you can't have all three . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . "
A,Task,"It's just impossible . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"if we're gonna pick betwe e "
A,Minor,"alright "
A,Task,"so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . "
A,Task,"Otherwise comm yeah comm we just it just becomes cost prohibitive . "
A,Minor,"What "
A,Elicit,"which comm which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . "
D,Task,"But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction "
D,Task,"but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with "
D,Task,"and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . "
B,Task,"I would have to side with that comm "
B,Task,"I think the voice recognition is simpler comm "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"we already have the all the technology in-house comm it's ready to go comm it's packaged comm "
B,Minor,"it's "
A,Elicit,"What does the cost look like Ron ? "
A,Elicit,"Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ? "
A,Elicit,"Nathan ? "
C,Minor,"Well my p is "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Um comm this is just off the top of my head keep in mind comm "
B,Minor,"but I think the voice recognition would "
B,Task,"they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up comm "
B,Task,"but um comm since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"we're not gonna have to do as much design work "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up comm if you know what I mean . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Um comm I definitely have to agree with that last comment . "
D,Minor,"And we're still not "
D,Task,"then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"we can stick with what we've already got . "
D,Task,"In a lot other ways too . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
A,Minor,"I'm getting "
A,Minor,"alright so "
A,Task,"more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em comm the voice recognition will be better . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I think it's our lower risk option "
D,Task,"which for right now we can have it on the market sooner "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"which is all in all our best option . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Sorted . "
A,Task,"We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . "
C,Other,"It's you and me outside a little here . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next "
D,Elicit,"that's you guys's next step right ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"well "
A,Task,"we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"but yeah that's our next step comm "
A,Task,"it'll be a developing of prototype . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ? "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"We'll just run through it yeah comm yeah comm um . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . "
A,Elicit,"Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? "
A,Elicit,"Or this kinesthetic one comm would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? "
B,Task,"Um comm the solar power definitely would be "
B,Task,"but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed comm "
B,Task,"'cause sometimes solar power fails "
B,Task,"and there's no way round that comm "
B,Task,"we should install a small backup battery . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason comm the remote hasn't been exposed to "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Elicit,"what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . Yep . "
D,Minor,"like what if wha "
D,Task,"we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere "
D,Task,"so having a secondary source is probably "
B,Task,"It's true . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"it works about the same as a solar powered calculator comm "
C,Other,"Calculator . "
B,Task,"and you know how those those don't really require that much light comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . True . "
D,Task,"True . "
B,Task,"um comm but obviously a little more light than a calculator comm but we're not talking about a lot of light . "
B,Task,"Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"What do you think Ron ? "
C,Task,"I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . "
C,Task,"If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control "
C,Task,"and maybe kind of have a round remote control "
C,Task,"that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that comm kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something . "
D,Other,"Uh "
A,Task,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Interesting . "
B,Elicit,"Why comm why moving away from hand-held comm why ? "
C,Task,"Just a thought . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"What's the uh idea ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . "
D,Minor,"I "
D,Task,"if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Do you think people that are people that buy a remote comm are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition "
B,Elicit,"or is it just something that they do sometimes . "
D,Task,"True comm "
D,Minor,"and i probabl "
D,Task,"I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people comm "
D,Task,"like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too comm "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"we have to have buttons on it too as well . "
D,Task,"right . "
A,Task,"But that's done comm that's no bother "
A,Task,"I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have "
A,Elicit,"or like um who is it comm "
A,Task,"Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"and you know "
A,Task,"and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I mean comm why not have a little rounded kind of thing comm "
A,Task,"it could still have the basic buttons on it . "
A,Task,"Um comm 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well . "
D,Minor,"With the bu yeah . "
A,Task,"And maybe a menu button and so forth comm "
A,Minor,"you know um "
A,Task,"use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Task,"I mean we can sort that out . "
B,Task,"I think comm I think you're on to something "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good comm even though and hand-held the same time . "
D,Task,"True . "
D,Task,"Way to go . "
C,Task,"I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"I'm thinking of the airport portal comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"you know like that little pod looking thing ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm "
C,Other,"Exactly . "
B,Task,"those are nice . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I mean a nice although we do um wh uh is "
A,Task,"I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"and get back to it "
A,Task,"but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um "
D,Task,"That would be kinda neat . "
D,Task,"Terracotta bowl or something . "
A,Task,"Still comm I mean comm yeah comm along those lines . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah I like that comm I like that idea a lot . "
A,Task,"Um comm let's see what we can do as far as that goes . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth comm we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"um you know "
A,Minor,"li lik "
A,Task,"if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"You know "
A,Task,"something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . "
B,Other,"Right . "
B,Task,"Just kind of the squishy feel . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"which is the next big thing comm "
D,Task,"so that's not gonna hurt us either . "
A,Task,"Mm 'kay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . "
A,Task,"But to be fair comm yeah comm I mean comm you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Yeah I like it comm I like the idea comm that's good . "
D,Task,"Handy . "
A,Task,"Um and we've sorted of discussed costs comm "
A,Task,"um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing comm if we run a bit over-budget comm that might be okay comm um . "
B,Other,"Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost comm "
B,Task,"I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"and I'm just having to guess . "
A,Minor,"We'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a "
A,Task,"we'll have more of an idea later on . "
A,Task,"Um . And we just yeah go from there . "
A,Minor,"Um comm so "
A,Task,"we've revisited the touch screen "
A,Task,"and more or less ruled that out comm "
A,Minor,"um comm I think so we're more or less con we wh wh "
A,Task,"we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function comm you know comm not too complex . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Right . Well "
D,Task,"when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis comm "
D,Task,"although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions comm "
D,Task,"they should be secondary comm at least if not functionally then visually comm "
D,Task,"like those shouldn't be "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Like maybe have menu things . "
D,Task,"Take precedence comm "
B,Task,"If comm if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
B,Task,"and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things . "
D,Task,"And they slide . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Elicit,"and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen "
D,Task,"which isn't a touch screen "
D,Task,"but you're still scrolling through menu options comm "
D,Minor,"in p "
C,Task,"Think then we're hitting our cost issue again . "
D,Task,"True comm "
D,Task,"we're still not making it easier then . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"we've also got the the me the thing of comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote comm how do we yeah . "
D,Minor,"True . "
D,Task,"Fair enough . "
A,Minor,"B But no I mean "
A,Task,"we could do a slide or a compartment comm "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Task,"like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing comm it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Or you know comm a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing comm like on um like on a D_V_D_ player . "
A,Minor,"You know "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"it's just a scroll . "
A,Task,"and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"are we gonna are we talking "
B,Elicit,"we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use comm "
B,Elicit,"are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"it seems like "
A,Minor,"I dunno "
A,Task,"it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber "
A,Task,"'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"we might as well stick with that um . "
D,Task,"Probably . "
B,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons "
C,Task,"and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Well no "
D,Task,"it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it comm "
D,Task,"are really versatile "
D,Task,"and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own "
D,Task,"so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things "
D,Task,"'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay comm um . "
A,Task,"We've already kind of covered this as well . "
A,Task,"That seems to be selling "
A,Task,"um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market comm um . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . "
D,Task,"Right comm "
D,Task,"particularly in technological fields comm "
D,Task,"so that's exactly where we're headed . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um . Yeah alright comm well comm "
A,Task,"more or less covered what we need to cover I think "
A,Minor,"fi an an "
A,Elicit,"any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype . "
C,Elicit,"Well what are we actually doing ? "
C,Minor,"What were "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Other,"I was just gonna step on to um "
D,Other,"Uh . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"it wasn't in the way but yeah comm whatever . "
A,Elicit,"I wasn't ? "
A,Other,"Oh comm "
A,Other,"my bad "
A,Other,"um sorry . "
D,Other,"No comm don't worry about it . "
A,Minor,"The "
A,Minor,"um comm yeah okay "
A,Other,"I was just gonna assign tasks in the next "
C,Task,"Sure . "
A,Minor,"b anyth any oth "
A,Elicit,"any other final thoughts before we go ahead and "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"cool ? "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? "
B,Elicit,"Or are we just going to go with one ? "
A,Other,"Um . "
B,Task,"..It's very comm it's very hard thing to predict "
B,Task,"because you have different cases "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and that might open up your market a little bit obviously comm "
B,Task,"but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"It's a tough situation comm "
B,Task,"but obviously having more cases also costs more "
B,Minor,"so "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do comm "
A,Task,"you could have uh a comm you know comm a um uh kind of a natural wood colour comm like a stained wood and um comm I don't know comm olive green or something . "
B,Task,"There's an idea . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing . "
C,Task,"And again copying iMac's kind of for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"get in there . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm totally . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think that's probably a good id "
A,Minor,"okay so "
A,Task,"let's work on uh multiple case colours . "
A,Minor,"But yeah comm "
A,Task,"stick with the same kind of kinda yeah comm the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . "
A,Task,"Cool . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm so "
A,Task,"we'll have the next meeting about half an hour comm um . "
A,Minor,"I want the uh I'd like "
A,Task,"Nathan comm I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel comm "
A,Task,"what can we accomplish comm um comm given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . "
A,Task,"Um comm what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . "
B,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"And um Ron if you can "
A,Task,"figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . "
A,Task,"Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . "
A,Task,"Um comm and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . "
A,Task,"Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype comm um using um prototype building materials um . "
A,Task,"And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . "
B,Task,"Oh excellent yeah . "
A,Task,"So that's what to start with for now comm "
A,Elicit,"is that alright comm "
D,Task,"Cool . "
A,Elicit,"you guys feel clear about this ? "
B,Task,"That sounds good . "
C,Task,"Fabulous . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"I guess we'll just hit the bricks . "
A,Other,"Thanks guys . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
