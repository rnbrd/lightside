B,Minor,"Mm-hmm "
B,Elicit,"So comm ready ? "
D,Task,"No not really "
C,Minor,"'Kay "
D,Minor,"Just "
D,Other,"Crap . "
B,Other,"Sorry comm "
B,Minor,"I I um "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"It's perfect . "
B,Minor,"I'm afraid "
A,Other,"Your judgement it's is biased . "
B,Other,"Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . "
D,Minor,"'Kay comm "
D,Elicit,"so whe where is the remote control ? "
A,Minor,"So comm "
C,Other,"Where ? "
A,Minor,"we are "
C,Task,"It's here . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"let's go for our detailed design meeting . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"So I will still play the role of the secretary comm "
A,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer comm David Jordan comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and our Industrial Designer comm Baba . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"So we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control comm "
A,Task,"and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . "
A,Minor,"And in case "
A,Task,"if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control comm we'll evaluate the um production . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their "
C,Task,"I have slides . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"You have s "
A,Other,"oh comm sorry . "
A,Other,"Oops . "
C,Minor,"Ah comm "
B,Task,"Effectively one slide "
B,Task,"and maybe we can discuss everything . "
C,Minor,"Product prod "
D,Other,"What slides ? "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So comm this is our product or prototype . "
C,Task,"This is made by clay . "
A,Task,"Looks strange . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . "
C,Task,"Yellow is uh our company colour comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"uh red it's uh is more attractive . "
C,Task,"So we used two basic colour comm yellow and red . "
C,Task,"And the shape comm there's two basic shape . "
C,Task,"The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . "
C,Minor,"It's "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"we call it a mushroom design . "
C,Task,"It's looks like some mushroom comm so we call it mushroom design . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"So this is a introduction of our product . "
C,Minor,"Next a mo "
A,Other,"Genetically modified mushroom I will say comm but "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"keep on speaking . "
C,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"yeah comm so next slide . "
C,Task,"So there are several key features of our pr prototype . "
C,Task,"The first is that it is fuzzy . "
C,Task,"I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah I'm sure . "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Maybe comm I hope so . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm so it's a fuzzy design comm and a unique design . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
C,Minor,"Um comm and uh "
C,Task,"the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . "
C,Task,"In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel "
C,Task,"but now we have a s circle comm so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . "
C,Task,"So it's quite convenient for user to use it . "
A,Minor,"Chan "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm "
A,Task,"but don't touch don't destroy your prototype . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm s "
C,Task,"okay . "
C,Task,"Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . "
C,Task,"Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable comm so "
C,Minor,"uh so it's it's um "
C,Task,"it's unlikely you cannot found it . "
C,Task,"So it's v Um comm you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel "
C,Task,"and there's some cute button . "
C,Task,"You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom comm so "
A,Task,"Everything's mushroom . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm everything's mushroom . "
A,Task,"So we can call our remote control the mushroom . "
C,Minor,"Mush "
B,Task,"Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape comm you know comm "
C,Task,"Mushroom design comm yeah . "
B,Task,"centre is yellow and t d "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Other,"th that's why if you put it in the table comm be careful comm somebody will eat it . "
B,Minor,"To integrate comm you know yeah . "
B,Minor,"I don't think "
B,Other,"I hope nobody will eat it "
B,Task,"You know comm to integrate the fruit aspect comm "
B,Minor,"you know the the in "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm because mushroom was not in the trends . "
D,Task,"I mean there was fruits yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Really ? "
A,Task,"Fruits and vegetables . "
B,Minor,"But "
B,Minor,"Fruit and vegetable comm "
B,Minor,"so mushroom was a kind of you know uh "
A,Task,"Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable . "
D,Task,"I don't think it is . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's vegetable . "
B,Other,"Mushroom ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Oh comm uh I'm not sure . "
A,Task,"So th it's something eatable . "
B,Minor,"We can "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"it's a veg a kind of vegetable comm "
B,Task,"but you know we we integrated them with different colour . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway comm so it's fine . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . "
B,Task,"This comm you know comm very enlighted colours comm you know . "
D,Minor,"No comm I mean comm yeah yeah . "
D,Minor,"Inspira inspiration is "
B,Task,"And inspired colour "
B,Task,"and and very sophisticated material comm so . "
D,Task,"True . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"And so "
A,Task,"Next slide . "
C,Task,"Uh comm no this our only two slides . "
B,Minor,"So what we w "
B,Other,"what I can add is that comm you know "
B,Task,"he talk about what is outside comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about comm you know comm the chip comm "
B,Task,"it is a low level chip comm and "
C,Other,"So we cut it to see . "
B,Other,"You know comm we don't need to k . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"You know wi "
B,Task,"the low level chips inside "
B,Task,"and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"So where's the battery battery ? "
B,Task,"The battery it is under . "
B,Task,"It is in th in in the base comm yeah . "
A,Task,"In the base . "
C,Minor,"Base . "
A,Task,"In the basement . In the basement . "
C,Elicit,"Here ? "
A,Elicit,"And where is the solar solar cell ? "
D,Task,"But we say uh we sa we said solar . "
A,Elicit,"Where is the solar cell ? "
B,Task,"In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Elicit,"Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price ? "
C,Minor,"Okay "
B,Task,"I don't think so comm "
A,Task,"Okay comm we'll see after . "
B,Task,"but it it's might be okay comm so . "
A,Minor,"We will have first to "
B,Task,"I it might be okay . So "
A,Elicit,"so comm mister money comm what's your opinion according to this remote control ? "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I mean comm we gonna try to measure how good it is "
D,Minor,"instead of just talking about uh "
D,Task,"we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design comm "
D,Task,"and first one was uh "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"fancy look and feel . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale comm "
D,Task,"one being uh no comm I think . "
D,Other,"Uh just let me check . "
B,Task,"So comm four point three point five comm it means it's acceptable . "
D,Task,"One one being true comm and seven being false . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Oops . "
D,Other,"Ouch . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Do we have a fancy look and feel comm according to you ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
B,Task,"I think you have nice colours . "
B,Minor,"I don't "
D,Minor,"But is it "
B,Task,"The sha the bowl shape people like . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm the shape is unique comm "
C,Task,"and the colour "
D,Task,"Uh I'll agree it's unique comm "
D,Elicit,"but is it really "
C,Elicit,"So it depend on how d do you define fancy . "
B,Elicit,"Is it really fancy ? "
D,Task,"Yeah I mean comm fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . "
B,Minor,"But it's "
B,Task,"you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out comm "
B,Task,"Do Don't do that comm please . "
A,Task,"and maybe do things like that "
D,Task,"I dunno where the lemon is comm but "
D,Task,"I mean it's not obvious . "
B,Task,"I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like comm so "
A,Elicit,"It would be bet more like a lemon ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"If "
B,Minor,"Because i "
D,Task,"I dunno comm maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Less button . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Minor,"so comm my mush . "
A,Task,"Looks like more fruit . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but you don't have any button now . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"Maybe a pineapple ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"And you know comm you have the finger here comm with the buttons ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"That's uh yeah comm is that "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm it's getting "
B,Task,"that's a good idea . "
B,Task,"So that's great . "
A,Task,"It looks more like a pineapple . "
B,Other,"That's great . "
A,Other,"Sorry . "
A,Elicit,"What's the use for that ? "
C,Task,"Uh comm for turn turn the ball . "
B,Task,"I have no idea comm so . "
C,Task,"If you want to turn the ball comm it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . "
B,Task,"I have no idea what "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And where is the voice recognition ? "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Task,"Ah comm it's embedded comm your microphone . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm that's "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Th this th th there's two two functions . "
D,Task,"Wait th that's the second point . "
C,Task,"This is microphone array "
D,Elicit,"First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . "
B,Elicit,"If it is fancy or not . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Is it better like that ? "
D,Minor,"I mean "
B,Minor,"So we can we can say t "
A,Task,"Looks okay comm "
A,Task,"let's say it's a pineapple now . "
B,Elicit,"The colour comm is the colour acceptable ? "
D,Task,"No comm the colour is okay comm that's fine . "
B,Elicit,"So the shape now . "
D,Minor,"I mean it's "
A,Minor,"It looks like a "
D,Task,"but I would say there is more too much red . "
A,Other,"now you took it . "
B,Elicit,"It's too much red ? "
D,Minor,"Um if "
B,Elicit,"In the basement ? "
A,Task,"It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Right . So comm from one to seven ? "
A,Minor,"Mm uh "
B,Minor,"I will give I will "
A,Elicit,"Seven is the ma the maximum ? "
D,Task,"No comm seven is false and one is true . "
B,Minor,"I'll gi "
B,Task,"I'll give two or three . "
B,Task,"Three comm it's okay . "
A,Task,"Three comm I will say three . "
B,Task,"Three comm three . "
D,Elicit,"Three ? "
B,Task,"Three is fine for me . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"'Kay "
D,Task,"Three . "
A,Elicit,"Isn't it bitter like that ? "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
D,Other,"Then uh let me "
B,Minor,"What other "
D,Task,"The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . "
B,Task,"Is it easy to use ? "
A,Task,"Feasible ? "
B,Minor,"Ye uh "
A,Elicit,"You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an "
B,Task,"Embedded . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm this is microphone array comm in fact . "
B,Minor,"It's a micro array comm okay . "
C,Task,"There four microphone . "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"So they they they they there's a microphone array . "
A,Minor,"and you have the "
A,Elicit,"there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"So you can capture voice yeah comm you c "
A,Elicit,"And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? "
B,Minor,"Oh yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah . "
B,Task,"And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control comm so it is "
D,Task,"Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno comm in the core comm or single . "
B,Minor,"I "
B,Minor,"W Yeah comm but "
A,Task,"We have tactile buttons . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I see comm you have microphone array embedded . "
B,Minor,"You have "
D,Task,"No comm that's good . Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's good . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm th that's another really good point . "
D,Minor,"Maybe okay . "
B,Task,"I think technically it's acceptable comm so "
A,Task,"Maybe two ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So using the same scale comm two ? "
A,Task,"Two ? "
B,Task,"Two comm yeah comm two . It's it's fine comm so . "
A,Task,"I would say two "
A,Elicit,". You agree ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
A,Task,"It's better like that comm "
D,Task,"Now maybe the most critical one . "
A,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Most "
D,Task,"L last one w I would like to judge is "
D,Elicit,"is it easy to use ? "
B,Task,"Eh comm for th the vocal command yes comm it's might be easy . "
B,Task,"But it's just speaking . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's very easy . "
B,Task,"You just need the command . "
D,Task,"Yeah but this this turning "
C,Task,"You can use this in this way . "
D,Elicit,"can you can you just re explain me the "
B,Other,"As a principle . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Please . "
C,Task,"Th this is the base . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So you can turn to change the channel . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? "
C,Task,"You just tu turn d d "
B,Minor,"I think maybe if you he "
D,Task,"Like if you want to go from "
A,Other,"Oh comm ok I understand . "
B,Task,"If you hear some click "
A,Task,"You take take the remote comm so "
A,Task,"and you can turn like that to change the channel ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah but imagine you y "
A,Task,"I think it's quite easy to so s zapping comm "
A,Task,"but maybe it will be too fast . "
D,Task,"Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from comm I dunno comm one to twenty ? "
B,Task,"Oh yeah comm that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"How can you go directly to twenty comm for example ? "
C,Task,"No comm no comm no . "
C,Minor,"I if y uh if "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"it depend on the the angle you turn the "
D,Task,"Yeah . I agree . I agree . "
B,Minor,"Yeah but y how "
D,Elicit,"But I mean if you're fro from two ? "
B,Task,"you need to know I "
C,Task,"I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two comm channel three comm channel four comm channel five . "
B,Minor,"I think something that "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm you have a comm like that comm and so on . "
C,Task,"So change . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"And you you can "
D,Task,"Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh "
A,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
C,Task,"Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree . "
D,Minor,"We're not talking "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So you got how many degree you you it "
A,Task,"Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go "
B,Task,"I think you can if you have a scale comm so "
C,Task,"No no comm you don't have to y no "
C,Task,"it's uh when you when you stop t uh "
C,Task,"when you stop comm the the turn comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? "
C,Task,"It's it's very easy comm because you kn you know how many channel are there in the "
D,Elicit,"So you you count one degree comm two degrees comm no . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . You can do it . "
D,Task,"I don't think so . "
C,Task,"I think so I think so you can do it . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's a bit difficult . "
C,Task,"I think so comm you can just change . "
B,Task,"I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . "
B,Task,"You can say fifty and fifty it's okay comm so "
D,Task,"Yeah voc vocal command is okay . "
D,Task,"But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main "
C,Task,"There's uh also a number comm you know . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other comm "
A,Task,"so you're passing through all the channels . "
A,Task,"So comm when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty comm "
A,Task,"so you can say channel twenty comm or channel four comm because you really want to go on this channel . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm yeah comm and y that's yeah . "
A,Task,"But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do comm you can turn it . "
D,Task,"And this would be more for browsing comm ah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? "
B,Minor,"To see uh "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"yeah uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Seems to be good . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Good choice comm mister David Jordan . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm I mean you're famous . You . "
B,Minor,"And but I'd "
C,Minor,"And also you can comm if you i "
A,Elicit,"yeah comm what's what's this cherry ? "
C,Task,"You ca you can turn this . "
C,Task,"Or you ca you can you can also turn this . "
B,Task,"It is a turn off t turn off button comm maybe . "
C,Task,"For this you can tune it's for tune . "
C,Task,"You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two comm you you skip this . "
C,Task,"If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"It's like fine comm from coarse to fine . "
C,Task,"This is coarse comm this is fine . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah yeah . That's "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So it's coarse to fine design . "
B,Other,"that's very technologic comm so . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah is is "
C,Task,"this is comm from one channel to maybe to ten channel . "
B,Elicit,"S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates "
C,Minor,"This is from one channel to "
B,Minor,"maybe one of the "
A,Task,"Yeah comm th you have the vocal commands . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Uh it's k "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"On off . "
B,Minor,"on off comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but it has to be on to recognise fas "
A,Minor,"Most of the time you have the "
A,Task,"yeah it's a sleeping remote control . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm sleeping . "
D,Task,"Ah comm that's not the ecological part comm yeah . "
A,Task,"That's true . "
A,Task,"W that why we have the solar ti yeah . "
D,Task,"Solar . "
B,Task,"To compensate . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"So comm which number ? "
A,Task,"three . "
B,Task,"Easy to use comm it's very relative "
B,Task,"but three it's fine comm I think comm "
B,Task,"it's reasonable three . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Do you agree ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm agree comm agree . "
A,Elicit,"Three ? "
D,Elicit,"So reasonably comm is four comm is one ? "
B,Task,"Three f three for me comm it's o it's okay . "
D,Task,"So comm three . "
B,Task,"Four or three . "
B,Task,"Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives "
B,Task,"and no and just take the mean . "
A,Elicit,"And what's your opinion ? "
D,Minor,"Uh we wouldn't say comm I mean comm "
B,Elicit,"Will you give four ? "
D,Task,"those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . "
B,Elicit,"Five ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm so maybe if "
C,Minor,"Uh w w what do y what uh "
C,Elicit,"you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think it's easier than traditional controller . "
C,Task,"If you use traditional controller you have to put a button comm but now you don't have to put button comm "
C,Task,"you have you just turn the turn the ball . "
B,Minor,"Yeah but y you know "
C,Task,"There's two kind of balls comm "
D,Minor,"So you have "
C,Task,"the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Elicit,"But in the traditional controller comm how do how can you control the scale ? "
D,Task,"Uh by pushing zero after after the first one . "
B,Task,"You just push two button comm zero and and one . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"And that's "
C,Task,"yeah comm yeah comm y you you can do it comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . "
B,Elicit,"Are there some buttons ? Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm this function is just for your browsing comm from one channel to th the next one comm the next s sn s comm the th the third one . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"It's not what you said previously . "
A,Task,"Previously you said that turning this was the fine "
D,Task,"Yeah comm if you're changing your mind . "
D,Task,"Fine to coarse . "
A,Task,"Fine to coarse . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"And from ten to ten channels here . "
C,Task,"Y one to ten comm ten to twelve comm uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty "
C,Task,"and this one comm t one two three four five six comm like this . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh there's different scale comm "
C,Task,"so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"But this this has to stay on the table comm right ? "
C,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"This has to stay on the table . "
C,Task,"I i this is just a base . "
B,Task,"In fact on a flat place "
C,Minor,"You can just "
B,Minor,"You can "
D,Task,"Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Oh "
B,Task,"Oh ye yes comm that's right . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm no no comm no . You can't put it out . "
D,Minor,"Just "
D,Minor,"It's "
A,Task,"It's just your turning from the base . "
A,Task,"You need to have everything in hand . "
A,Task,"If you want to turn comm you can't use it and turn . "
A,Task,"It's impossible . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You need to put it on and turn . "
D,Task,"You know tha that's the weak point comm "
B,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"because with a traditional one you just have one hand . "
C,Minor,"You use your y "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . "
B,Other,"my God . "
A,Task,"Nobody would take it . "
D,Minor,"Sure . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you would never you would never lose this one comm yeah . "
A,Task,"So nobody w will lost lose it . "
C,Other,"So th this is a d next generation controller . Yeah . "
B,Other,"yeah maybe comm maybe may "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"it's the next prototype comm maybe we cou "
C,Minor,"Okay okay comm okay . "
A,Minor,"S maybe we can change from th "
B,Task,"Four . Maybe four comm it's okay . "
C,Task,"Four . Okay . "
A,Minor,"Four ? "
B,Other,"I'll put four . "
A,Task,"Easy to use comm four . "
A,Other,"Gonna say four . "
D,Task,"Four . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm four it's more reasonable . "
D,Task,"Uh it's even easier to maybe . "
B,Task,"You can you can erase with this er yeah . "
D,Other,"Ok "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm four it's more reasonable comm so . "
B,Task,"So it's nine comm "
D,Elicit,"So comm average ? "
B,Task,"nine over three . "
D,Elicit,"Three ? "
C,Elicit,"Three ? "
A,Task,"Trois . Three . "
B,Task,"Oh yeah comm it's . "
C,Minor,"Trois . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so "
B,Task,"It need maybe some wo further work comm but it's "
D,Task,"Yeah comm especially on the easy to use "
B,Task,"Yeah comm uh s yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"target . "
B,Task,"Might it might be fine . "
A,Elicit,"So comm th the project is accepted ? "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm b I think "
A,Task,"But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So uh mm mm . Mm . "
B,Task,"That's the finance . "
A,Task,"Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . "
A,Task,"So as we all agree to accept comm under certain conditions comm the prototype comm we'll have look to the final sh financial view . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we need to calculate the production cost . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . "
B,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So comm just have a look at the okay here is the "
A,Task,"Excel sheet comm so "
A,Task,"so it has the energy source . "
A,Task,"We have hand dynamo . "
A,Task,"No comm we don't use that . "
D,Minor,"No . "
A,Elicit,"We have battery comm right ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm we have battery . "
A,Elicit,"Kinetic comm we don't have it comm I suppose comm "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"um solar cells comm yeah . "
A,Task,"but we have solar cells . "
A,Elicit,"Um comm how many do y do you need comm solar cells ? "
A,Elicit,"Do you think one would be enough comm or such as "
B,Task,"Uh I think in each ball you have three "
A,Task,"as number of branches ? "
A,Elicit,"Three ? "
B,Task,"three uh yeah comm "
B,Task,"three comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Three three solar cells . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Elicit,"electronic . "
A,Elicit,"Single simple chip on print ? "
A,Elicit,"Just one would be necessary ? "
B,Task,"S s simple comm simple comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"One ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Zero for the others . "
A,Task,"And sample sensor comm sample speaker . "
A,Elicit,"One ? "
B,Task,"Mm . One maybe comm yeah . "
A,Task,"As we have voice recognition comm I think . "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So the case . "
B,Unlab,"Is it "
B,Unlab,"Is sh it "
D,Task,"So we are all already nineteen . "
B,Task,"Wooden . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"just keep on going comm just to have an idea . "
C,Task,"The solar cell is too expensive . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's "
B,Task,"There's no wood comm so plastic just only comm I think . "
A,Minor,"Well uh "
A,Elicit,"yeah comm but what what about case ? "
A,Elicit,"Uncurved comm flat comm single curved comm double curved . "
A,Task,"I think it's more like double curved . "
D,Task,"That's gonna be double curved comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Double curve comm yeah comm double curve . "
A,Elicit,"One ? "
B,Task,"One comm you have . "
A,Elicit,"Uh wood ? "
B,Minor,"But it's yeah comm "
D,Task,"Rather four buttons . "
B,Task,"a a rubber uh "
D,Minor,"Oh no comm interface . "
A,Elicit,"Uh do we need special colour ? "
A,Elicit,"Y maybe comm two ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . Y y yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah that's special colours comm sure . "
A,Task,"We have two special colours . "
A,Elicit,"Push button . "
C,Task,"Mm . Yeah comm we have four . "
B,Elicit,"Five ? "
C,Task,"Five . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Scroll wheel . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"We don no . "
A,Task,"It it's more like integrated scor . "
B,Task,"I think that this will be like a scroll wheel comm actually . "
C,Task,"No no . "
D,Task,"Yeah tha that's wheel . "
B,Task,"Y you tu you turn you turn it comm so "
C,Task,"No no no comm it "
A,Task,"Yeah comm maybe two scroll wheel comm as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm true . Yeah comm yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm yeah comm yeah . Scr "
A,Elicit,"So comm no button supplements ? "
D,Task,"I think the price is okay . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Um comm "
D,Task,"no . "
A,Task,"Okay we I think we have problem . "
B,Task,"L_C_ display comm maybe . Interface . "
A,Task,"I think we s if we keep on adding things "
B,Task,"It's okay . fine . "
A,Task,"so we have to "
D,Task,"Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . "
A,Task,"Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? "
D,Unlab,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Has it changed . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it was stage one comm so . "
D,Task,"No y i it did change comm but "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh . "
D,Task,"just imagine we have "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"We have to delete the the sample sensor comm I think . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but we have you the the voice recognition comm "
A,Elicit,"no ? "
D,Task,"Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really "
C,Minor,"Yeah it's the one it's "
C,Task,"m maybe we ha we have two versions comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"the first version comm the basic version . "
B,Task,"I think you can transform the wood into plastic comm maybe . "
C,Task,"Advanced version we have speak . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Because uh it seems that this can be "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm if "
A,Task,"Or it would be better . "
B,Task,"yeah comm wood into plastic and it it should be fine . "
C,Task,"Plastic is free . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So comm do we need special colour ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's one of the requirement . "
A,Task,"Because we have red . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm red and yellow . "
C,Minor,"Wait . "
A,Other,"Red and yellow . "
D,Task,"We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . "
B,Task,"Fancy . "
C,Minor,"We we can we can we c "
C,Task,"yellow . "
D,Task,"Black then is a regular colour comm so . "
A,Task,"I think so we need if we try to have a kind of "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm one . "
A,Task,"pineapple bee . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . "
A,Task,"And I think this is one . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm thi this might be . "
A,Task,"Integrated scroll wheel push button "
A,Task,". So we'll we have only one ? "
A,Task,"And push button . "
D,Minor,"Close to . "
A,Task,"So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button comm it's uh "
B,Minor,"One . "
B,Minor,"I can remove "
B,Task,"maybe f you have five with push buttons comm so we can just comm I dunno comm try to modify some of them to have yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Okay comm so what's the bottleneck ? "
C,Task,"How about we change the sale ? "
D,Other,"Double curved . "
B,Task,"Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . "
A,Task,"Something flat . "
B,Minor,"F some "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but flat "
A,Task,"S uncurved . Yeah comm maybe not . "
D,Minor,"Case comm what's the ca "
B,Task,"Single curve . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Single curve should be fine comm so . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm what "
A,Task,"Mm . Nearly . "
C,Minor,"Ah we have one "
D,Task,"And then one Euro left . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Maybe don't bat no battery comm only solar cells . "
B,Task,"It's it's a bad idea comm so . "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"I think there's a problem with the push push button . "
A,Task,"We only need maybe just one . "
B,Task,"Two ? "
B,Other,"One . "
A,Task,"Just one . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's fine . That's fine . "
C,Task,"Okay . Okay . Agree . "
D,Task,"So we have one button comm "
A,Task,"So yeah comm you will have "
B,Task,"One s one scroll wheel comm so "
D,Task,"one wheel . "
A,Task,"So one button comm and s "
A,Task,"scroll wheel with push button on it . "
B,Task,"And the vocal chord comm it's fine . "
B,Task,"It I th it's fine . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"It's good they're not charging anything for that . "
A,Other,"So comm yeah . It think we we've done good job comm as the cost is "
C,Minor,"Cou could we have look "
A,Other,"twelve fifty e "
C,Elicit,"Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ? "
D,Task,"Yeah y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but it's under or equal . "
A,Task,"It's not written . "
B,Task,"It's fine . "
A,Task,"Sometimes it's under or equal . "
B,Task,"It's under or equal . It's fine comm so "
D,Task,"Okay . Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So let's say "
A,Task,"Twelve fifty . "
C,Minor,"Wha what "
C,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"It's fine comm twelve fifty uh "
C,Elicit,"Which part is the most expensive part ? "
D,Task,"Solar cells . "
B,Elicit,"The solar cells comm r is i is it ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think it's not t t "
A,Task,"I think comm yeah . "
A,Task,"But it would i be interesting for our marketing team comm to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be "
B,Task,"Yeah comm to be able to si to sell it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Cheaper . "
D,Task,"That's nice argument comm "
D,Task,"but if it's it's still four our of twelve . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm with mi "
B,Task,"It's it is really really uh really very very expensive comm though . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Maybe if uh okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative comm so . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah but we just have one button . "
A,Task,"So it's easy to use and powerful comm as the remote control a has only one button . "
D,Task,"Easy . "
D,Task,"I don't know about powerful . Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's easy to use . It's very easy to use . "
A,Task,"Easy comm powerful . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product . "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"Uh that's what we've just done . "
B,Task,"We've done it with it is under the if it was low comm high or so . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"okay . "
A,Minor,"Now "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Well I think we have just have to discuss if "
B,Task,"Okay comm okay comm it's fine . "
D,Minor,"I dunno . "
A,Elicit,"So did you enjoy your clay modelling ? "
C,Task,"Yes . Of course . This is my job . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's uh it's good comm to to create a control instead of a computer . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end . "
B,Task,"And designing comm looking at the chips comm the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And for the marketing guy ? "
D,Task,"Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings comm maybe . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff "
D,Task,"next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards comm so it um . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm okay . "
A,Task,"And new ideas about new products comm "
A,Task,"maybe comm wi which would be fashion and uh "
A,Task,"and yellow . "
B,Other,"Yellow . "
B,Task,"I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . "
B,Task,"It can be an interesting I don't know "
A,Task,"Yes comm just lemon . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um "
B,Task,"It's flat comm uh "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah it's flat comm "
A,Task,"Squared ? "
C,Task,"yeah the shape is very boring . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . It's really boring comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_ ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So you can you have base comm triangle base so you the T_V_ you can "
A,Other,"Ah comm the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's that would be really interesting comm actually . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Because the T_V_ you also "
A,Task,"Oh comm that's interesting . "
A,Task,"You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device . "
B,Minor,"Device devi "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but just don't trust too much the trends . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"The fruit ? Yeah . "
D,Task,"'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . "
A,Minor,"Maybe "
A,Task,"Yeah comm maybe la next year it will be insects . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm it's "
D,Task,"Maybe two years it's dead . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after comm you know comm if the people change their mind you change also the product . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but this is good because it's not a long long life product . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"T_V_ is more like fifteen years comm maybe comm so . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . That's a yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for "
B,Task,"We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones comm you know . "
D,Task,"fifteen years "
A,Task,"Customable T_V_ . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you customise it every ti so every ti if people change comm you just change the appearance comm and y y you can keep "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Ah such yeah . "
A,Other,"You've already said mobile phones . "
D,Task,"Tha that would that would make it . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you can keep the global appearan "
A,Task,"Yeah comm and following "
B,Task,"The mood of persons comm the fashions uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"We int "
A,Task,"It's interesting comm maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm T_V_ comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter comm you know comm so it's "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So what i and do w is it Okay . "
A,Task,"So I think the costs are within the budget . "
A,Task,"We're just at twelve fifty Euros . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm the pr at "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"do you think you can celebrate your creation ? "
C,Other,"And you can celebrate your leadership . "
A,Other,"Oh comm thanks a lot . "
A,Other,"Thank you comm mister David Jordan . "
B,Minor,"Yeah but I think f "
B,Other,"it's really a celebrating object . "
B,Other,"So it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy comm so . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Other,"Yeah . It's party party remote control . "
B,Minor,"Uh it's it's a pr it's like yeah . "
A,Task,"The thing now is to to sell it . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's your job . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Other,"Sell it . "
B,Other,"right comm go and sell it . "
B,Other,"Goo and good luck comm so "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"Twenty five Euros . "
C,Minor,"Twenty five Euros comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm I think it's "
C,Minor,"Twenty five Euros . "
A,Task,"It's maybe a little bit expensive . "
D,Task,"It's cheap comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"No comm I "
C,Task,"No comm it's not so expensive . "
B,Task,"It should be fine . "
D,Task,"I'm not so happy about the fruit shape comm you know . "
B,Other,"Wh really ? "
B,Task,"It should be it should be fine comm you know comm actually . S "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside comm and if bees come comm it's really fruit . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I I think I like the the colour a the colour are very good comm so actually so "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"But don't put sugar in it comm it's not working . "
D,Task,"No comm the colours are uh it's perfect comm yeah . "
B,Task,"It's perfect comm and "
D,Minor,"True . "
D,Task,"Uh yeah comm another thing is the logo is missing still . "
B,Minor,"I p is th y "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but the colour comm I think the colour is more is most important comm "
B,Minor,"the the yellow ball thing that "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . "
D,Task,"Still that was one of the requirements we had . "
D,Task,"It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . "
B,Task,"Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but we decided to have something yellow and red comm for the costs . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side comm the double R_ . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Okay yeah comm yeah . That's actually good idea comm so "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"So we have the logo comm we have the colour comm and we have the fashion in electronics comm "
C,Minor,"So we have to give a "
A,Task,"so we have the slogan too . "
C,Task,"So we have give him give it a cute name . "
D,Minor,"Cute na "
A,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"Mush mushroom controller . "
A,Task,"th no comm it's the it's the pineapple control remote control . "
D,Task,"You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . "
B,Task,"It's not a mushroom . "
A,Task,"It's a pineapple now comm it has changed . It's a pineapple . "
D,Task,"It's not the trend . "
B,Task,"It's a pineapple remote controls . "
C,Other,"Pa "
A,Task,"Pineapple . "
C,Other,"Pine apple . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm pineapple remote remote control . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but just flying saucer comm or "
A,Other,"With cherry on top . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm that "
D,Task,"I would say flying saucer . "
B,Other,"Oh unid uh unidentified remote control comm so "
D,Task,"It's more appropriate comm somehow . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"That's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Will you buy one ? "
B,Other,"Yeah . Yeah I will try I'll try "
A,Minor,"Try to . Okay uh "
C,Other,"Twenty five Euro . "
B,Other,". I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ "
B,Task,"Yeah I always lose my "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ comm so it would be "
C,Task,"so you need to buy one . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"One thing I like is the shape comm because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket comm on uh in your jacket . "
C,Elicit,"Traditional one ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"So this one and this one . What do you choose ? "
A,Other,"I prefer the laser remote control . No . "
B,Task,"I think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's "
C,Elicit,"What do you choose ? "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"it's will enlight your house comm your home and your T_V_ comm so . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Oh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah that would be uh an idea . "
D,Task,"Yeah but that's going to be expensive comm you know . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"We had some problems going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno . "
A,Task,"I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one comm and maybe add some features to it after yeah . "
B,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Yeah comm afterwards comm if "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"if it's a new trend . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Yeah that's that fine . "
B,Other,"So we can celebrate now . "
B,Task,"That's our new product . "
A,Other,"Champagne comm mister Baba . "
D,Other,"We should celebrate . "
B,Other,"Yes . "
B,Task,"It's it's fine . It's "
B,Task,"I like it . "
C,Other,"So buy one . "
B,Other,"Next time . "
B,Other,"Well comm I'll buy one here . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"Okay comm I will close this . Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . No ? "
A,Task,"So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and we have a nearly final product . "
D,Task,"Our final prototype which yeah . "
B,Minor,"Final prototype comm yeah comm ye yeah . "
A,Minor,"Final prototype comm right . "
C,Minor,"Prototype comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"thank you very much . "
B,Minor,"Okay . Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Very productive . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Thanks . "
B,Elicit,"S so who is going to take the remote control ? "
