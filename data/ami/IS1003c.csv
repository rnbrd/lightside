A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"as the previous meeting I will be the secretary "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and we will have three presentations "
A,Task,"and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept "
A,Task,"and finally we'll close the decision . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"I will first uh "
D,Task,"No "
D,Task,"y you do the minutes first comm "
D,Minor,"or ? "
A,Other,"What ? "
D,Elicit,"No ? "
A,Task,"I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first comm Mister David Jordan . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Minor,"we'll "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"S "
A,Elicit,"technical accessoire ? "
C,Task,"No no no . "
A,Elicit,"Interface ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"This . "
C,Task,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"So uh "
C,Other,"first I will present the concept of user interface . "
C,Task,"Um there's three concepts in the user interface . "
C,Task,"So first one it's a Google controller . "
C,Task,"The second is a fancy controller . "
C,Task,"The last one is uh intelligent controller . "
C,Task,"So there are three concepts in our controller . "
C,Other,"Um n next I will explain one by one comm "
C,Task,"the first is Google controller . "
C,Minor,"Um comm so "
C,Task,"I want the controller to be easy to use comm but with sophisticated functions . "
C,Task,"So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . "
C,Task,"Uh this is a first concept of our controller . "
C,Task,"The second concept is a fancy controller comm "
C,Minor,"um so "
C,Task,"we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive comm "
C,Task,"um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products comm "
C,Minor,"so so "
C,Task,"the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute comm very very g um "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"A nice one . "
C,Task,"attractive . "
C,Task,"Such like this comm there are several uh examples in the slides . "
A,Task,"I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"it's very comm "
C,Minor,"you know "
C,Minor,"if you're "
A,Task,"It's very big comm "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"It's hard f i "
C,Task,"it's easy for you to remember it . Or to recognise it comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm why not . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We'll have big discussion I suppose after that comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"so . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"the last uh concept is intelligent . "
C,Task,"We want uh we want our controller to be smart comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"so maybe we should uh use um uh "
C,Task,"technology comm such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology comm "
C,Task,"so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um "
C,Task,"With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Something else ? "
C,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"There "
C,Task,"this is the three concepts of our controller . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"I just have one question comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"because for the intelligent controller comm you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but as the um expert told us comm most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm so "
A,Elicit,"Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? "
A,Task,"Because comm if they do all the time the same gesture comm as you said previously in the last meeting comm maybe they will get injuries because of that ? "
C,Minor,"Y "
B,Task,"Yeah . Maybe . "
A,Task,"or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five comm I think they will be bored after a while . "
A,Elicit,"You don't think so ? "
C,Task,"Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
C,Task,"For example comm if you cannot find your uh controller comm you can just uh just just uh speak something such as comm yeah comm one two . "
A,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"Oh yeah comm that's a good that's a good point comm so . "
A,Task,"That's true . "
B,Minor,"One and "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So you can use your gesture . "
C,Task,"That's no problem . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Elicit,"but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? "
A,Elicit,"Broken arm ? "
C,Task,"For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very "
D,Other,"Okay . Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ comm and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time comm do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"But this this but this would never happen anyway . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"they cannot speak at the same time . "
A,Elicit,"Why ? "
D,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"If you have one brother and one sister "
A,Task,"and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"but the "
A,Task,"so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah but Yeah "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's very interesting . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"but this "
A,Minor,"so . "
B,Task,"but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"because the "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I don't think it "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but you have the remote control comm "
A,Task,"so maybe you can keep it f with you . "
B,Task,"That's right . "
A,Task,"You're not you're not obliged to share it . "
D,Other,"Oh comm okay comm okay comm "
D,Elicit,"you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"we can "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Even you h you have the controller comm I can I can say channel three comm "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"It's it's "
C,Task,"so it's c come to channel three comm "
D,Task,"No comm but this is disadvant disadvantage . "
C,Minor,"I don't have to "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think it's a disadvantage . "
C,Task,"It's advantage . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"but one other question . "
B,Task,"manual controllers comm eh . "
A,Elicit,"How how much will it cost ? "
B,Minor,"No comm "
B,Task,"more expensive maybe . "
C,Other,"How much ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working . "
C,Task,"No no "
C,Minor,"we we d we we just are use um "
D,Minor,"Uh if you if if you use the basic "
A,Task,"Some some efficient . "
C,Task,"No no "
C,Task,"we just um have some cooperation with some research institute comm "
C,Task,"we don't have to do some basic research on this field . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? "
A,Minor,"Or ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I think it's uh "
C,Task,"because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition comm "
C,Minor,"it's very "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"but uh uh "
C,Minor,"it's uh "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . "
C,Minor,"It's "
D,Minor,"Because then you need uh "
D,Task,"I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition comm for example . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"y y you have also the language problem comm "
C,Minor,"No "
C,Minor,"it's uh "
C,Minor,"Even for the f um because the the vocabulary the "
B,Minor,"you know "
B,Minor,"when you "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
B,Task,"'Cause it it have to be universal comm "
B,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"Yeah . I agree with uh "
C,Task,"The vocabulary is very small comm "
C,Task,"so that's not a problem . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"remote control . "
A,Task,"We need something that is international . "
A,Task,"Suppose we're we want to sell it in France . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"The recognition system will be able to understand French . "
A,Task,"If you want to go to England comm it will be able to understand English comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"so . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"the key comm the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"this could be downloaded by the web maybe comm "
D,Minor,"or "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"mechanism . "
B,Minor,"but you know . The product The pro "
C,Task,"It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . "
C,Task,"It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French . "
B,Task,"It's a very smart comm it's a very smart controller maybe "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Mm comm okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"it's "
A,Elicit,"And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? "
B,Other,"Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed . "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"but how will you "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"but the problem is how to s "
B,Minor,"you know "
B,Task,"if this is a push button controller comm you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world comm the same one . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"If you have the language comm you have to develop for each country . "
C,Task,"Oh n Yeah comm yeah "
C,Task,"tha that's why we have to do language adaptation . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but for each country you have to do one comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"because uh the for example for Se "
C,Task,"Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to "
B,Elicit,"Oh really ? "
B,Minor,"That's "
A,Other,"Oh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"but then w "
A,Task,"Seems to be quite complex . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"we have to take care of the twelve Euros "
B,Minor,"Comple "
C,Task,"No comm it's not so complex . "
D,Task,"problem . "
A,Elicit,"And what about voice recognition comm do we have microphones ? "
A,Elicit,"And where will be they ? "
A,Elicit,"Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? "
C,Task,"No no no "
C,Minor,"it's not "
C,Task,"I think that's n that's not a problem "
C,Task,"because you you don't have to wear a microphone . "
C,Task,"It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"but where is the controller ? "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Where is the controller ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's in your family comm in your home . "
D,Minor,"No comm "
D,Minor,"but then it's it's like this uh "
A,Other,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"but we're "
A,Task,"here it's uh an object . "
A,Task,"But here you say you want to use i uh s technology . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"you can you can embed it uh microphone here . "
B,Other,"A microphone maybe . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this comm if you have an object . "
A,Task,"If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free comm without any object . "
B,Task,"To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe . "
A,Task,"You just want to interact with television . "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah "
C,Task,"just you just put the controller here comm "
C,Task,"then you "
B,Task,"I if you say one comm he switch to channel comm "
C,Task,"you use your command "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"and you do s your gesture . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but you can lose it . "
C,Task,"No no "
C,Minor,"it's n y if you lose it "
B,Minor,"So well "
B,Task,"for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,"you so you can build a kind of black box "
B,Minor,"Devic "
A,Task,"and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Ah . "
D,Task,"But you would still have the buttons . "
D,Minor,"Or is it "
D,Elicit,"do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? "
D,Elicit,"Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? "
C,Task,"think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user "
D,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"and we think "
D,Minor,"so you "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"You can see they can switch form one modality to another . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
D,Task,"It's a bit risky risky . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think so . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"that's quite inter quite attractive . "
A,Minor,"And maybe it will be quite "
B,Task,"But I think that comm you know comm switching from one country to to another will be a problem comm "
B,Minor,"so although y y "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"if you do language adaptation comm there should be no problem . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"but i i "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"We should have confidence in technology . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm we should . Uh . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . So comm "
A,Elicit,"what do you think ? "
A,Task,"We'll try the controllers you'd prefer . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"What ? "
A,Elicit,"Which kind of controller would you prefer to use comm you as a remote control user ? "
D,Minor,"If if "
D,Minor,"I mean comm uh "
D,Task,"I'm sure if the user pays the same price comm he's happy to have recognition . "
C,Task,"More features comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"But if if if it like doubles uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but "
B,Task,"I think he need a control that is very reliable comm "
D,Task,"no one would would be interested . "
B,Minor,"so . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller "
A,Task,"and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . "
A,Task,"Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? "
A,Elicit,"Hmm ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller comm easy to use comm sophisticated and fancy . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Elicit,"You think it's possible ? "
C,Elicit,"but if if you stick to um "
C,Elicit,"stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? "
C,Task,"There's no k features of our controller comm "
C,Task,"so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Minor,"I mean "
C,Elicit,"Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that "
B,Minor,"It's not really the we "
D,Minor,"Y "
B,Task,"we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet comm so or something like that . "
B,Minor,"But uh I think a user need "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller comm "
C,Task,"that's a function of T_V_ . "
C,Task,"You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function comm "
D,Minor,"No comm "
D,Task,"but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or comm I don't know comm if you wanna type something comm "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"Don't have a the the "
D,Minor,"or "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"if we can send email from it . "
C,Task,"But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller comm it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . "
D,Task,"No . No . "
B,Minor,"Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if "
D,Minor,"Cause for example yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"but we do we do we we "
C,Task,"we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"but uh we want so "
C,Task,"but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it comm your mobile comm "
C,Task,"but you when you choose a new mobile comm you choose the one with voice recognition . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"you wou you would "
D,Task,"True . "
C,Minor,"That's "
C,Task,"the feature is not one hundred percent reliable comm "
C,Task,"but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but w we we want something th that works all the time comm every day comm every hour comm for everyone . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm uh "
B,Task,"And for all the person of the family maybe comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable comm would you replace it with another one ? "
A,Task,"You don't need to tune it . "
B,Minor,"so comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm why not ? "
D,Minor,"I mean comm for example the goo y "
A,Minor,"If it's "
B,Minor,"Because you have new "
D,Task,"you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . "
D,Task,"Google is is simple comm "
D,Task,"works fine comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic comm simple and works fine comm it's already a lot . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Oh yes comm "
C,Task,"but there's no big difference between the traditional controller . "
D,Minor,"Uh thi this "
D,Minor,"I mean comm "
D,Task,"the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition "
D,Minor,"or "
C,Minor,"The then nn "
D,Task,"if he has something that works fine and is really fancy comm looks nice and it's easy easy to use comm easy to use . "
C,Task,"no . "
C,Minor,"Tha "
A,Task,"Not too expensive too . "
C,Task,"But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . "
D,Minor,"See "
D,Task,"That's the problem comm "
C,Minor,"That's the same "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"I mean comm I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But you have to think comm the user is the one who gonna buy the product "
B,Minor,"Ye "
D,Minor,"and so . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
D,Unlab,"I mean comm that's the point . "
A,Task,"let's go to the Industrial Designer . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"so . "
A,Elicit,"Two ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm participant two um "
A,Elicit,"Working ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm working design comm "
B,Minor,"so . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"I think "
A,Other,"I can "
B,Task,"Can you go to the next one ? "
B,Minor,"I uh "
B,Task,"it's not this one . "
B,Minor,"It's uh oth the oth so I "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"It's the working design . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Task,"Component design . "
A,Other,"It's okay "
B,Minor,"So this yeah so this is the described use "
B,Elicit,"What ? "
B,Minor,"Are you inst "
A,Task,"Uh I think there's something wrong with your "
C,Task,"It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it . "
A,Task,"Maybe you you record it somewhere else . "
B,Task,"I don't think so . "
C,Task,"Participant one . Participant one . "
A,Other,"Interface concept . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Mm mm . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"Maybe I record recorded directly on the Computer . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Dunno . "
A,Task,"Nope . "
B,Other,"Okay comm okay . Yes . "
A,Task,"It seems that we have a problem with the "
D,Elicit,"I dunno if you remember what you had to say "
D,Minor,"or "
B,Task,"I can say it to you without . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"so "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"maybe we can first come to "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"I think it will be more interesting to start with uh "
C,Task,"uh to Frahan . With Frahan comm "
D,Task,"I think it's more interesting what he says comm "
C,Task,"then you can prepare your slides comm "
D,Task,"okay . "
C,Task,"then present it later . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"exac "
A,Minor,"You will had s some more information in "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm true . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"In fact comm I don't know comm "
A,Minor,"So . "
B,Minor,"I s "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"because i in my presentation I don't have here with "
B,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"Okay comm never mind . "
B,Task,"It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"of the remote control . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"and so . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"I in fact the the f "
B,Elicit,"something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use comm "
B,Minor,"so "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control "
B,Elicit,"or a a plastic remote control like this one . "
B,Minor,"So and "
B,Elicit,"in which which which kind will be the the different bu button comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"it can be some comm you know comm classic pushbutton like this one comm "
B,Task,"or you have also some button like L_C_D_ "
B,Task,"where you know comm the button the buttons are unlighted during the night comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"or comm you know comm you can see them in the darkness . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"And "
B,Elicit,"the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation comm electric alimentation do you want to have comm "
B,Elicit,"so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Elicit,"or will it be a battery like the classical battery "
B,Minor,"so . "
B,Task,"And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have "
B,Task,"uh both of them comm "
B,Minor,"so so "
B,Task,"for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from comm you know comm the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal comm so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation comm you just comm when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it comm for example . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think it's an added value to the remote control "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah mm . "
A,Task,"and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers "
B,Task,"Ecologists comm "
B,Task,"yeah comm yeah comm yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"but about the the price of adding this solar battery comm would it be something really that will increase the price of production more comm "
A,Elicit,"no ? "
B,Other,"Alrigh "
B,Minor,"In fact comm having them both will "
B,Task,"if we want to have battery comm regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price comm "
A,Minor,"So . "
B,Task,"but it will be an added value also "
B,Task,"that will be compensated comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"so hmm . "
A,Elicit,"And what tha what about the uh materials ? "
B,Other,"And the materials comm "
B,Task,"it depends "
B,Minor,"for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more "
B,Task,"the plastic material is more common "
B,Task,"it's very resistant "
A,Task,"Impersonal comm mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but comm you know comm something wooden will be like comm I don't know high cl so a special high class comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Special for "
B,Minor,"or you know comm you can have some "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm even if it is not completely wood comm but just a part of the comm you know comm will be wooden comm in wood "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"and it can be interesting . "
A,Minor,"Mm okay comm "
A,Task,"seems to be interesting comm mm . "
B,Minor,"And so "
B,Elicit,"the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits comm chips comm or do you have low level or or very very expensive comm "
B,Task,"it depends comm "
B,Task,"but I think that low level will be comm you know comm it is an interim module . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"we want something easy to use "
A,Task,"and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And you think that we will be "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I think it will fit on the price we want comm twel twelve Euros comm "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"so . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"wood . "
A,Elicit,"And what about the buttons ? "
B,Task,"I think the buttons I pr I prefer comm you know comm the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons "
B,Task,"because comm you know comm it's I don't know um yeah comm in the dark comm it's fashion "
A,Minor,"No "
A,Task,"it's fashion comm yeah . "
B,Task,"and it's related to how beautiful it is "
B,Task,"or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness "
B,Task,"or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost comm you know in the darkness "
B,Task,"it's very easy so comm right . "
D,Elicit,"What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . "
D,Task,"It's it's expensive I I guess . "
B,Task,"I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"But And it is a kind of other design comm I mean . "
B,Task,"It can also be interesting to have this kind of "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"you got email ? "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"I think we have only uh five minutes left . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Participant four ? "
A,Elicit,"Functional requirements ? "
D,Task,"Uh no comm "
D,Task,"trend watching . "
D,Task,"The other one . "
A,Elicit,"This one ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . Uh comm I think so comm "
D,Minor,"just "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm so "
D,Other,"just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market "
D,Task,"and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market comm "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"next . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"again comm it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . "
D,Task,"Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . "
D,Task,"They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel comm "
D,Elicit,"okay . "
D,Task,"Like the one you've shown comm David comm with all the buttons and I mean i i it sounds good technically "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"but it's it's not what they want "
D,Minor,"and uh "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Task,"second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative comm "
D,Task,"so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"At the same time comm it's important that it's easy to use . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . "
D,Task,"Now i if we look at fashion in general um "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables comm "
D,Elicit,"okay comm "
B,Other,"Ah yes . "
D,Task,"so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . Okay comm yeah . "
D,Task,"'Cause it's it's really what people want . "
D,Task,"Even if it's in general fashion comm we want it to be in the remote control . "
D,Task,"And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points comm fancy look and feel has comm on a score of seven would have six as importance . "
D,Task,"Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative comm it's three . "
D,Task,"Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one comm "
D,Task,"and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris "
B,Task,"And fruit and vegetables "
B,Other,"yeah . "
D,Task,"we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . "
D,Task,"And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch comm "
B,Other,"Spongy 'Kay . "
D,Minor,"okay so "
D,Task,"this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design . "
B,Other,"Okay comm yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"thi this is this would be like um "
B,Minor,"Pla "
D,Task,"plastic-like comm but rubber comm mayb maybe comm you know comm rubber-like uh "
B,Minor,"S "
B,Minor,"Very stuff "
B,Other,"Okay comm rubber rubber desi okay comm yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"device comm "
D,Minor,"so um "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"tha tha that was the main point comm I think comm from the trend in fashion . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we have to take decisions about the component concepts comm about the energy . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"as you say you want something technologically innovative comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting comm "
B,Task,"Solar . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm so when I think it's "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"maybe will attract "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"It will be a "
A,Task,"pro-ecology consumers . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"I think "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Case . "
C,Elicit,"Later ? "
A,Minor,"So you think case . "
A,Elicit,"Something spongy . "
A,Elicit,"Someth no wood . "
B,Task,"No wood "
B,Elicit,"but Plastic ? "
D,Task,"Maybe not no wood comm "
D,Task,"but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know . "
B,Minor,"Would some "
C,Minor,"Pla "
A,Minor,"Maybe you "
B,Task,"I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and comm you know . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm maybe the base . "
B,Task,"It depends on the design we want comm "
B,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"It's it's natural . "
D,Minor,"But still y "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's natural "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Th The feeling is natural comm "
B,Minor,"and i "
A,Task,"so maybe we can stay with wood . "
B,Task,"And it can be correlated to energy comm solar energy comm so for the marketing aspect comm "
B,Minor,"you know comm "
B,Minor,"saying that it's ecol "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . "
B,Task,"Mm comm yeah comm it's not right comm "
B,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"But it's still fashion . "
D,Task,"But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons comm "
D,Minor,"or "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"something that you can into it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Uh and what about the user interface concept ? "
B,Elicit,"Google and "
A,Elicit,"Google and fancy ? "
B,Elicit,"and fancy comm "
B,Minor,"f "
B,Elicit,"how about the the voice ? "
A,Task,"Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . "
B,Minor,"And "
C,Task,"Uh yes . "
B,Task,"Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested "
B,Minor,"and how "
B,Task,"It It is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"The smart controller . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But and "
B,Task,"the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ comm so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually comm "
B,Minor,"so . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice . "
B,Task,"But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control comm "
B,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"That's true . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"d "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"maybe try to mix them these two concepts together comm just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's good . "
A,Task,"And L_C_D_ buttons . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm L_C_D_ . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"And pf what can we think a supplement to "
D,Elicit,"What interface ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"for the interface something added value . "
B,Task,"I think the supplement can be the voice . "
B,Task,"It is just comm you know comm it is not the most important comm but it can be a part of "
A,Elicit,"With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"commands comm words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"To push button comm "
B,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Even it is for s just some kids comm you know comm switching channels one two three four . "
A,Task,"Turning the T_V_ o on o or off . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm turning yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Not very complex commands comm but easy commands comm "
B,Minor,"so . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"adding some vocal commands . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Simple ones ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm simple ones "
B,Minor,"for "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . "
A,Task,"So you will have to work on the look and feel design comm to have the easy to use comm powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh you will have to work more comm Baba comm on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons "
B,Other,"expensive buttons "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"to make some new "
A,Task,"and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Other,"fruits . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"If possible . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And remember as as I said last meeting comm we really have to build a fashion remote control "
A,Task,"and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . "
B,Other,"Need it to be comm okay . "
A,Task,"So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control comm "
A,Task,"so you will have to model model something . "
C,Task,"Okay . Yep "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"no more questions comm "
A,Task,"we can close the session . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Sounds good comm mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Okay comm cool . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
