A,Minor,"Okay um comm "
A,Other,"welcome to our detailed design meeting . "
A,Task,"I'm pretty excited . "
A,Task,"Let's start "
A,Task,"it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that . "
A,Minor,"Okay um "
A,Task,"the agenda "
A,Task,"we're gonna do an opening "
A,Task,"and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting comm what we d discussed um comm "
A,Task,"then we'll have the prototype presentation "
A,Task,"and a look at the evaluation criteria . "
A,Task,"We'll look at the finances "
A,Task,"and finally a do a production evaluation "
A,Task,"and close . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Other,"starting off with the um last the last one comm "
A,Other,"oh "
A,Task,"I don't have it here um comm "
A,Task,"but we talked about energy comm "
A,Task,"we're gonna use a kinetic battery um comm "
A,Task,"we want to use a simple chip comm "
A,Task,"because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um comm "
A,Task,"we're gonna need a scroll um comm "
A,Task,"we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved "
A,Task,"and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . "
A,Task,"And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons comm including five pre-set channels . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Task,"Let's do the look and feel design presentation first . "
C,Minor,"Right comm "
C,Task,"do you wanna start ? "
B,Minor,"Right comm well "
B,Task,"we made three different prototypes "
B,Other,"and I guess we'll start with with this one . "
B,Minor,"Um we have "
B,Task,"our colours not are not fixed comm "
B,Task,"but this is the general shape . "
B,Minor,"Um it's "
B,Task,"you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand "
B,Task,"or you switch it over "
B,Task,"and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand . "
B,Task,"You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone comm "
B,Task,"or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand comm "
B,Minor,"or even "
B,Task,"I mean there's a whole variety comm "
B,Task,"you can hold it like this "
B,Task,"and press it with your same index finger . "
B,Task,"Uh we have the on off button at the tip comm very visible comm very big . "
B,Task,"We have our up and down buttons comm "
B,Task,"which are also gonna be our channel selectors comm "
B,Task,"and we have our little menu button here . "
B,Task,"If you push if you're just pushing these normally comm they're the menu buttons comm if uh the volume buttons rather . "
B,Task,"If you press select once comm they become channel changing buttons . "
B,Task,"If we press select three times comm the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up comm "
B,Task,"and you have your five presets down here . "
B,Task,"Um if people wanna grab hold of that comm "
B,Task,"see how it feels in your hand . "
B,Task,"That's our number one prototype . "
B,Elicit,"Um do you wanna present the potato comm "
A,Minor,"like a little lightning in it . "
B,Elicit,"or shall I present the Martian ? "
C,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"um "
A,Task,"The little lightning bolt in it comm very cute . "
C,Minor,"What "
C,Task,"We call that one the rhombus comm "
D,Minor,"I could "
C,Task,"uh the rhombus . "
A,Other,"The v the rhombus rhombus ? "
B,Task,"That's the rhombus comm yep . "
C,Task,"Um this one is known as the potato comm "
C,Minor,"uh it's "
C,Minor,"it's a "
C,Other,"how can I present it ? "
C,Task,"It's an ergonomic shape comm "
C,Task,"so it it fits in your hand nicely . Um "
C,Task,"it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand . "
C,Task,"Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . Um "
C,Task,"the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . "
C,Task,"So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . "
C,Task,"Um the red ones are for uh changing channels comm "
C,Task,"channel up and channel down "
C,Task,"and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected . "
C,Task,"Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu "
C,Task,"and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select "
C,Task,"and that's basically it comm that's the potato . "
A,Elicit,"Um on comm off ? "
C,Task,"Uh that would be one of your channels comm basically comm "
C,Task,"so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Yeah we turn it off . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ? "
C,Task,"Um not really comm "
C,Task,"it would make it hard to turn the machine off comm to turn your T_V_ off . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"If you pressed and held it maybe . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah comm that that'd be one way of doing it comm yeah . That'd work comm yeah . "
D,Task,"If you like held it down comm that would be on off . "
B,Task,"Yeah . On off comm that's a possibility comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear comm either way . "
B,Task,"Um it's a bit different comm just a little bit more of a creative feel . "
B,Task,"Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . "
B,Task,"We have the five preset seeds . "
B,Task,"And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional comm "
B,Task,"you have your channel changing comm volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"that's for your consideration as well comm "
C,Task,"Let's pass . "
B,Task,"plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . "
B,Task,"We figured it could stand up like this on your table comm if you wanted it to comm if I made the bot the bottom flat . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Other,"Sorry comm "
D,Elicit,"what's the yellow one in the middle comm "
D,Task,"I forgot . "
B,Task,"Uh the menu select button . "
A,Task,"Very interesting . "
A,Task,"I think that one's my favourite . "
C,Minor,"So that's "
C,Task,"So that's our three prototypes . "
C,Minor,"Um basically comm "
C,Task,"in terms of making decisions comm what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want comm "
C,Task,"then decide what kind of button layout we want comm how many buttons comm "
C,Task,"and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons "
C,Task,"and if we wanna put any text on the device comm like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"We were we were thinking that "
B,Task,"normally we'd go for fruity colours comm "
B,Task,"but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man comm for an example customer comm might not want a fruity coloured remote comm "
B,Task,"so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down comm "
A,Task,"Mm 'kay . "
B,Task,"maybe with with less contrasts on it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Would "
B,Task,"something still a little bright to make it hard to lose comm but "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Now "
A,Task,"that was one thing that we brought up over email . "
A,Elicit,"I don't know if you picked up your email comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost . "
B,Minor,"Right . Well "
B,Task,"we were we were talking about that a little bit "
B,Task,"when we got that email "
B,Task,"and we think that each of these are so distinctive comm that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . "
B,Task,"It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss "
D,Task,"But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it . "
A,Minor,"It's really "
A,Elicit,"Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device "
A,Elicit,"that like I dunno comm you tape to your to your T_V_ "
A,Elicit,"um that when you press it "
A,Minor,"you ha "
A,Elicit,"a little light beep goes off ? "
A,Elicit,"Do you think that would be conceptually possible ? "
C,Task,"I think it would be difficult technologically comm "
B,Minor,"I think "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee "
C,Task,"and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it comm "
A,Other,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"s so it's "
C,Task,"I'm not quite sure how it would work "
A,Task,"That's true comm mm 'kay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . "
C,Minor,"Uh I mean "
C,Elicit,"ho how many times do you really comm seriously lose your remote control "
C,Elicit,"and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ? "
B,Task,"There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something comm "
B,Task,"but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay comm that's a fair evaluation . "
A,Other,"Getting lost . "
A,Task,"Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,"'cause well comm the designs are very bright comm "
A,Task,"so you're right comm they're gonna stick out comm "
A,Minor,"but um "
B,Elicit,"So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? Um . "
D,Task,"I feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists "
D,Minor,"so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun comm "
D,Task,"even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to comm "
D,Task,"just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . "
D,Task,"I sort of like this one comm "
D,Minor,"like "
D,Task,"I I don't know why comm "
D,Task,"it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking comm "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
D,Task,"But I also like the b the side buttons on that one comm like I think that's kind of neat . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable comm sort of cool looking thing "
D,Task,"that we also need to focus on . "
A,Elicit,"Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? "
A,Elicit,"So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ? "
B,Task,"Mm yeah comm "
D,Other,"Ah comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's possible comm yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"that's good comm that's good . "
D,Task,"there we go . "
B,Task,"Here comm "
B,Task,"stick it on . "
C,Task,"Put an extra the button on . "
A,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria comm "
A,Elicit,"if you've developed some ? "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"do we w "
D,Minor,"like "
D,Task,"I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for . "
A,Other,"Oh "
A,Task,"okay . Okay . "
D,Minor,"That was "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"where "
D,Other,"I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do comm "
D,Minor,"but let me "
D,Other,"I have to like write something on the whiteboard comm so . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Do you need this "
A,Elicit,"or just write on the white board ? "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"'cause I think it would be redundant . "
B,Other,"Right . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing comm "
B,Other,"Ooh . "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Task,"kinda push it . "
C,Other,"Cool . "
B,Other,"Hey . "
A,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Maybe a little smaller than that . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"I kinda like it . "
B,Task,"That's hard to miss . "
C,Task,"It makes look more fruity as well . "
A,Task,"Oh it does comm "
A,Minor,"it's kind of like "
C,Other,"It's like a deformed foot comm "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"There it could have a stem like that comm "
A,Task,"'cause I do l kind of like the stem . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Like "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It almost helps you ge keep a grip too comm "
A,Task,"'cause it goes in between fingers . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Interesting . "
A,Task,"I like this one . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Elicit,"is that where people are leaning then comm the potato ? "
A,Task,"Variety of colours are nice . "
B,Minor,"I like the idea of the "
A,Task,"I think I'm leaning towards the potato . "
B,Minor,"I mean "
B,Task,"that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down comm that one . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I am worried about like um using a menu . "
A,Minor,"Um in that "
A,Minor,"like "
A,Minor,"i "
A,Task,"withing menus there are submenus comm "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Elicit,"and so how do you get back to the main menu ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"that "
B,Task,"on the iPod comm for example comm you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again "
B,Task,"and it brings you back one level . "
A,Task,"But that has a menu button separate from a select button comm "
A,Task,"whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Good point . "
C,Minor,"This is comm it's "
C,Task,"the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"You find the choice that you want "
C,Task,"and you press uh you press the right button uh . "
A,Elicit,"Could these be used for going to submenus "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm so they're used for going into and out of your submenus comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"or "
B,Minor,"Maybe "
B,Minor,"yeah comm "
B,Task,"maybe it can be one of those comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"if you press down and hold "
B,Task,"for two seconds comm then it brings you back one level or something . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Well comm "
A,Task,"as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still comm "
A,Task,"mm 'kay . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so "
D,Elicit,"which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities comm "
D,Elicit,"the yellowy one is that "
B,Elicit,"The potato ? Are we leaning towards the potato ? "
C,Elicit,"Potato . "
A,Task,"I think so . "
D,Other,"Okay comm "
D,Minor,"well "
D,Task,"we can obviously change it after we go through each different one . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"basically what we need to do is "
D,Task,"some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately "
D,Task,"rank each of the following things "
D,Other,"and then I'll tabulate an average "
D,Task,"just to make sure that it does meet that . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"we'll just go through them one at a time "
D,Task,"and we'll just go around "
D,Task,"and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven "
D,Task,"with one being really extremely true "
D,Task,"and seven being not true at all comm or false comm "
D,Elicit,"if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"we can do this one first . "
D,Elicit,"First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . "
D,Minor,"So like "
D,Task,"in my opinion the for now at least comm the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle "
D,Task,"so I'm gonna say it's like a three . "
D,Task,"That's just my opinion . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"What does each of you "
A,Task,"I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two . "
D,Other,"Okay comm "
D,Minor,"well "
D,Task,"give it a number comm "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"sorry . "
A,Task,"I will give it a one . "
B,Minor,"Um I dunno if it's "
B,Task,"it's creative . "
B,Task,"I dunno if fancy is the word I would use . "
B,Task,"I dunno if any of them are fancy "
B,Minor,"in "
B,Task,"I'd say two comm "
B,Task,"because c unique . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"And two comm "
C,Task,"I'll go for two . "
D,Other,"awesome . "
D,Minor,"Alright comm "
D,Elicit,"and same sort of scale for functionality comm is it functional ? "
D,Task,"I think it's extremely functional comm "
D,Task,"I'm gonna give it a one . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"one . "
D,Other,"One ? "
C,Task,"I think it's it's functional comm "
C,Task,"it's also pretty basic comm "
C,Task,"so I'll give it a two . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um functional . "
A,Task,"I think it'll get everything done comm "
A,Task,"I think it might be a little confusing at first comm "
A,Elicit,"um comm I don't know if that's gonna be a later one . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"there's some other ones comm "
D,Other,"I will address that comm "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"then I'm gonna give it a two . "
D,Other,"Awesome comm "
D,Other,"okay . "
D,Elicit,"Um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative . "
A,Elicit,"Did you give a functional ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"she said it was one . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Um is it technologically innovative ? "
D,Task,"Mm . Not really comm I mean not so much comm "
D,Task,"'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen comm "
D,Task,"we don't have fancy chip . "
D,Task,"Other than what it looks like comm I dunno if it's really "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"the kinetic battery . "
B,Task,"In the battery comm that's it . "
D,Minor,"I "
D,Task,"kinetic battery is a big one comm "
D,Minor,"so . "
B,Task,"How many people would notice that comm though ? "
D,Other,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"But it "
A,Task,"But they'll notice it after like a year comm "
D,Task,"but we know it's there . "
A,Task,"they'll be like hey comm I have never changed the battery . "
D,Task,"And if it's made of like latex comm that whole idea comm that's pretty cool . "
A,Task,"Mm . Just the material . "
D,Task,"I'll give it a three . "
D,Minor,"'Cause it "
D,Task,"we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"I I would say that it's "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"like fancy versus creative it's it's different . "
B,Elicit,"But does that equal innovative ? "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"I'll give it a three . "
D,Other,"Alright . "
D,Elicit,"Everyone else ? "
C,Task,"I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique comm "
C,Task,"I mean it's it's just it is just pushbuttons um comm "
C,Task,"so I I'd give it a four . "
A,Task,"Think I'm gonna go with the four as well . "
D,Other,"Mm 'kay . "
A,Task,"I really like that kinetic battery though . "
D,Elicit,"Next comm is it easy to use ? "
D,Task,"Just so you know comm easy to learn will be separate comm "
A,Other,"Mm 'kay . "
D,Task,"so don't overlap them . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I think it's really easy to use . "
D,Task,"I'll give it a two . "
B,Task,"Um I'll give it a one . "
B,Task,"Pretty hard to mess up . "
C,Task,"I'll say one . "
A,Task,"Uh let's say two . "
D,Other,"Alright . "
D,Elicit,"Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality "
D,Task,"and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I it's spongy all the way . "
A,Task,"Give it a one . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"I wonder if it bounces when you drop it . "
B,Other,"Ooh comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"that you couldn't "
B,Task,"it'd be harder to break comm "
B,Task,"harder to lose . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Cause there would be less impact maybe comm . "
D,Elicit,"Iain comm what do you give it ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"I'd I'd give it a one . "
D,Minor,"Alright "
D,Elicit,"and the next is comm does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? "
C,Minor,"Uh um . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Elicit,"is it gonna be yellow ? "
B,Task,"It it might be comm "
B,Task,"'cause that's our corporate colour comm "
B,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
A,Task,"That's right comm yeah comm "
A,Task,"corporate colour comm we didn't keep that in "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We might wanna keep it yellow . "
A,Minor,"um well "
A,Minor,"if we "
A,Task,"I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing comm "
A,Task,"but if we had all the buttons in black comm and a design in and the outside in yellow comm that'd be our corporate one "
A,Task,"and we could also have alternative colours comm one a more conservative one comm one that's more fruity . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? "
B,Minor,"If we had a yellow "
B,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Alright comm so "
A,Other,"Fruity comm so fruity . "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"I think it it's "
B,Task,"it was inspired by the potato comm "
B,Task,"so I think it's pretty fruity . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think i it's kind of mangoey too . "
B,Other,"Oh comm mango "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Mangoey is better comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"I "
D,Minor,"okay comm "
A,Other,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"that that "
D,Task,"I'm giving it a one "
C,Task,"I like mangoes . "
D,Task,"the mango put me over . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"That's a much more trendy than a potato "
D,Elicit,"What are what's everyone's numbers ? "
B,Task,"one . "
C,Task,"Uh two . "
A,Task,"One . "
D,Task,"Alright "
D,Elicit,"um comm and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? "
D,Task,"Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons comm "
D,Task,"that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . "
D,Task,"I think we really took that into account a lot comm "
D,Task,"so I'm gonna give it a one . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm me too . "
C,Task,"Uh one . "
D,Other,"Did you say one comm Rose ? "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Okay um comm "
D,Task,"also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing . "
D,Elicit,"Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? "
D,Task,"I think I'll give it a two comm "
D,Task,"'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do comm something is gonna happen . "
A,Task,"It's gonna be hard . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing comm "
A,Minor,"but um "
D,Task,"Um um worth the risk comm I think . "
A,Task,"I like how it fits in the hand though "
A,Task,"so I I'd go with a two . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I'll I'll say two as well . "
B,Task,"Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Minor,"but "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"I'll I'll say two . "
D,Other,"Alright comm "
D,Other,"awesome . "
D,Elicit,"And the ease of learning it . "
D,Task,"I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that comm "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
D,Task,"It sort of reminds me of the iPod . "
D,Task,"I just got mine comm "
D,Task,"I still haven't read the instruction book "
D,Task,"and I'm doing okay comm so "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"and I'm not good at learning technology . "
D,Task,"So I'll give it a two . "
B,Task,"The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing comm "
B,Task,"but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out comm but you'll have it afterwards . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess . "
C,Task,"I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn comm "
C,Task,"because you have to you have to use the menu system "
C,Task,"and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are "
C,Task,"and that could take a bit of learning at first comm "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"good point . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"but "
C,Task,"once you've comm yeah once you'd learned how to use it comm I think it is a lot easier . "
C,Task,"So I'd I'd give it a four . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I think I'd give it a four too . "
A,Task,"It's a pretty high learning curve comm "
A,Task,"it'll be easy once you've done it comm "
A,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Alright comm um "
D,Task,"also earlier we had something about losing it "
D,Task,"and so now we're not addressing that at all comm "
D,Minor,"so "
A,Minor,"We we "
A,Task,"I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour comm "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Minor,"but "
D,Elicit,"in terms of not losing it comm do you think that on a scale of one to seven comm how easy or hard is it to lose ? "
D,Task,"I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four comm "
D,Minor,"'cause I think that you can still "
D,Task,"if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it comm you're kind of not gonna find it comm "
D,Task,"but anywhere else it's gonna stand out . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um I'd say I'd give it uh a three comm "
B,Task,"I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally . "
A,Task,"Mm I'd give it a four . "
C,Task,"Um I'll give it a five "
C,Task,"'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Small too . "
D,Minor,"Alright comm "
D,Task,"we also said simplicity comm "
D,Elicit,"how w how well does it address just being simple ? "
B,Elicit,"Simple to use or simple in design ? Do you know ? "
D,Task,"I think overall comm "
D,Task,"'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion comm "
D,Task,"so those are the next two things we're gonna look at . "
D,Task,"Separate from fancy comm like that sort of thing . "
B,Other,"Right . "
D,Task,"Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple comm "
D,Task,"so I'm gonna give it a two . "
B,Task,"I'm give it a three I guess . "
C,Task,"I'll give it a two . "
A,Task,"Three . "
D,Task,"Alright comm "
D,Elicit,"and fashionable ? "
A,Task,"It's totally fashionable . "
D,Task,"It's hot comm "
A,Task,"I'd give it a one . "
D,Task,"I mean it's a mango comm come on . "
A,Other,"Mango . "
D,Task,"I mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? "
D,Task,"I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Other,"I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote "
A,Task,"I do like uh the little Martian one . "
B,Other,"or alien or whatever he was . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"the toggle on off switch comm it's really appealing . "
D,Elicit,"Number . "
B,Task,"Um two . "
C,Task,"Three . "
A,Task,"One . "
D,Elicit,"And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal comm that whole thing ? "
D,Task,"Just that it would se serve our audience . "
D,Task,"I don't see why not . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"I think as long "
A,Task,"if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements . "
A,Task,"Um yeah comm that's good . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So I'll give it a a two . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I'll say two . "
D,Task,"Alright comm "
D,Elicit,"did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ? "
A,Minor,"Well um "
A,Task,"we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo comm "
A,Task,"so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it . "
B,Minor,"Shall we uh "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"I think all of them should have an R_R_ . "
A,Task,"All of them should have R_R_ comm "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Elicit,"And so we're gonna do that comm "
D,Task,"so it will address it comm "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
D,Task,"fine . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"That's me . "
A,Other,"Lovely . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"now we're gonna look at finances . "
A,Task,"Um I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um comm "
A,Other,"so let me exit out of this first . "
A,Minor,"Okay um "
D,Other,"Whoa . "
B,Other,"Oh my . "
A,Task,"I know . "
A,Other,"Let me one more space . "
A,Other,"Gonna zoom in real quick . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Hand dynamo . "
A,Task,"We're using kinetic battery comm "
B,Task,"Uh we're n using kinetic comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"Um and we're having one per "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"One comm okay . "
A,Task,"Um electronics . "
B,Task,"Single . "
B,Task,"Simple comm simple rather . "
A,Task,"Simple . "
D,Task,"Simple . "
A,Other,"Mm 'kay . "
A,Task,"Um the case . "
B,Task,"Uh uh uh double-curved . "
C,Task,"Guess it's double-curved . "
C,Task,"It is pretty curvy . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's very curvy comm "
A,Task,"so okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"I never did get a picture of those "
B,Task,"so I don't really know . "
B,Task,"Our case material supplements "
B,Other,"oops comm "
B,Task,"we just skipped by them . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Elicit,"don't we need plastic comm and "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . "
D,Other,"Provided comm okay . "
B,Task,"The supplement is "
A,Elicit,"The wood ? "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"I guess it was rubber rather than latex . "
A,Task,"I mean the rubber . "
D,Task,"It was rubber and special colour comm "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm okay . "
D,Elicit,"Do we have more than one special colour ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Uh well "
A,Task,"we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours . "
C,Task,"Special colours comm "
C,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Elicit,"I don't know what the se the basic colour is though . "
D,Minor,"Per "
A,Minor,"I dunno where it "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"but we know that we're having at least three colours comm "
A,Task,"So let's y say three . "
D,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Elicit,"are we talking about on each colour combination "
B,Minor,"or are we comm "
B,Minor,"you know comm "
B,Minor,"we'll "
B,Task,"like we'll have yellow and black . "
B,Elicit,"Is that two special colours ? "
A,Other,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Elicit,"Or or is white and black comm then two more or "
A,Minor,"That I thi "
A,Task,"I thought that would be under yours . "
B,Task,"Uh . I guess it's three comm "
A,Task,"We'll just say three . "
B,Elicit,"three "
B,Elicit,"three . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well comm "
A,Task,"so yeah . "
A,Task,"Interface comm "
A,Task,"we're doing push buttons . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And how many buttons do we have ? "
D,Task,"We have six . "
C,Task,"We've got five . "
D,Other,"Oh "
B,Task,"Six comm with the power . "
D,Task,"no comm "
C,Other,"Oh "
A,Other,"Six . "
D,Task,"five . "
C,Task,"six . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Anything else ? "
B,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Minor,"we'll do we wa "
B,Elicit,"Are the buttons in special colour comm "
B,Minor,"special f "
B,Task,"I didn't get information on "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"wait . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Minor,"buttons "
A,Minor,"oh comm so um . So "
A,Task,"the case material will just have one colour comm "
A,Elicit,"right comm "
A,Task,"but then the buttons will be in special colours ? "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"does it "
B,Other,"but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where I'm getting confused . "
A,Task,"We're saying per unit . "
B,Other,"per unit comm okay comm okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm per unit . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"so each unit will only have one colour on their "
B,Other,"Alright comm "
B,Minor,"and each button s "
A,Minor,"but the case is "
A,Minor,"could have up to thr "
A,Elicit,"I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours comm "
A,Task,"'cause that how it's designed there . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I like it like that . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"Special form ? "
A,Task,"They're all kind of just push button comm "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"I think they're fine . "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Special material ? "
B,Task,"Material comm we want them rubber as well probably comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Uh . Oh "
A,Minor,"do "
A,Task,"I have to do it per button comm "
A,Elicit,"do I ? "
B,Task,"No comm I don't think so . "
B,Minor,"I think they're "
B,Task,"if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"It's "
D,Task,"I mean it's two to make it rubber . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Oh wait comm "
D,Task,"so maybe . "
A,Task,"Thirteen point seven . "
B,Task,"Oh oh . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"what can we reduce ? "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"let's have our buttons all be one colour . "
D,Task,"Mm comm I kind of like the buttons . "
A,Elicit,"Let's see what that would do . "
A,Task,"It's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway . "
B,Other,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"Okay um comm "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Elicit,"are we sure this is double-curved ? "
A,Task,"Maybe it's single-curved comm "
B,Task,"We have no idea . "
A,Other,"we have no idea . "
B,Task,"I dunno comm "
B,Task,"I didn't get any pictures . "
D,Task,"It's single curved . "
B,Task,"It's single curved . "
B,Task,"Why not ? "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"it's not the "
A,Minor,"yeah . Okay comm "
A,Task,"it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive comm "
A,Task,"but we have a simple chip comm single curve comm "
A,Task,"case material is rubber "
A,Task,"and it's a special colour comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but that's important . "
B,Task,"That is important . "
A,Task,"Six buttons we have to have six buttons . "
B,Elicit,"How did it get more expensive comm "
B,Elicit,"what did you just change ? "
A,Other,"What ? "
B,Task,"It was it was thirteen "
B,Task,"and now it's fifteen . "
A,Minor,"No comm okay comm "
A,Other,"maybe not . "
A,Task,"I don't know what just happened . "
A,Task,"Now it's twelve . "
D,Minor,"We "
C,Elicit,"What was our target price again ? "
B,Task,"Twelve point five . "
A,Task,"Twelve point five . "
B,Other,"Hey hey . "
C,Other,"Twelve point five . "
C,Task,"So we're just just about there . "
A,Task,"So we're okay comm I think . "
B,Task,"We're all set then . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Ish . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we're all set . "
B,Task,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Um save . "
A,Task,"I saved that to our um our big shared folder comm "
A,Task,"so you know . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"back to agenda . "
A,Elicit,"Um are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm they are . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Let's move on to the project evaluation . "
A,Task,"Project process . Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity comm leadership comm teamwork comm the means comm any new ideas found . "
A,Elicit,"So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project comm "
A,Elicit,"the information we got on the news comm how we used it comm "
A,Elicit,"if we were able to um comm you know comm use our creativity with the information comm "
A,Elicit,"um how how well I guess I led it comm "
A,Elicit,"um the how well we worked together as a team comm "
A,Elicit,"um the digital pens comm "
A,Elicit,"the whiteboard . "
B,Other,"Well . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I felt very creative . "
B,Task,"I enjoyed making the prototypes . "
C,Task,"I think we've been successful "
C,Task,"in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and we've come up with a finished project "
C,Task,"and we just about got cost . "
B,Task,"I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information comm "
B,Elicit,"like what's a single-curved case comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"how many colours comm "
B,Elicit,"what do colours count "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"things comm "
B,Task,"but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well . "
B,Task,"Um I think we worked together pretty well . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm I mean "
D,Task,"if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables comm maybe we could've taken that into account . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But the fruits and vegetables comm they really my creativity comm so . "
D,Task,"I know comm I really did comm "
D,Task,"the the whole mango idea was great . "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Minor,"I mean "
B,Minor,"Do you think we could "
D,Task,"I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally comm "
D,Task,"like its heaviness comm and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages comm I dunno . That was a bit of a distraction . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That was the last one comm like I chose not to do a PowerPoint "
D,Task,"'cause I didn't think it made sense to comm "
D,Task,"so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think we all made um very significant contributions comm "
A,Task,"I don't think anybody dominated it comm "
A,Task,"which I thought was really good comm "
A,Task,"like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information "
A,Task,"and I uh I tried to facilitate it without like taking over comm um "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I like our little finished products . "
D,Task,"They're funny . "
A,Task,"Really cute . "
D,Task,"I kind of want one . "
B,Elicit,"Can we market this as the mango remote ? "
B,Elicit,"Should we have that somewhere on the packaging ? "
B,Task,"I have a little R_R_ . "
D,Elicit,"I'm trying to think of a good pun that I could add there . "
A,Minor,"I know comm "
A,Task,"let's think of it like a little jingle . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"I like the R_R_ comm "
D,Task,"that's gonna be etched in . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Other,"Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point "
B,Task,"but um it's quite a useful little gadget . "
B,Other,"All thanks to Iain for the design of that one . "
A,Minor,". "
A,Minor,"Okay um "
B,Elicit,"Mm . What did we find for new ideas ? "
A,Elicit,"new ideas found ? "
B,Task,"People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables . "
A,Task,"Definitely . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm "
B,Task,"I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . "
A,Task,"etcetera . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Task,"I'm so excited . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"That was "
D,Task,"I didn't even know they existed . "
B,Task,"I I knew you can get watches that had them comm like really quite expensive watches "
B,Task,"that just never need a battery comm "
B,Task,"'cause you're always moving your wrist . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"But in other things comm I think it'd be really good . "
A,Minor,"I thi "
A,Task,"yeah comm that's awesome . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"closing . "
A,Elicit,"Are the costs within the budget ? "
A,Elicit,"Is the project evaluated ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Now "
A,Task,"there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . "
A,Minor,"Um so comm "
A,Task,"this is the great product kids comm "
A,Task,"I think we've created something really interesting "
A,Task,"and that we have a market for it comm um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"which we hope um "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results "
A,Minor,"and . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"Real Reaction . "
A,Task,"I do like the Martian remote . "
A,Task,"If we could choose more than one comm that would be my second choice . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"that would definitely be my second choice . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Although the tog toggle "
A,Minor,"I'm afraid I would "
C,Other,"That's cool . "
C,Minor,"Let's all let's all go for the yellow "
D,Other,"I would break it . I would break it . "
A,Task,"It's cool . "
A,Other,"I think I would break it . "
B,Task,"It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem "
C,Other,"Break the stem off . "
B,Minor,"and then "
B,Minor,"alright comm so "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"that's funny . "
B,Task,"Is it started as a pear comm "
B,Task,"but then it started looking more and more like a Martian "
B,Minor,"when I put the "
D,Task,"Kind of looks like a penguin comm like with no eye . "
A,Other,"Oh "
B,Other,"Take me to your leader . "
A,Task,"yeah comm it's kind of a penguin . "
D,Task,"I like that it stands up . "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
B,Minor,"Wow comm "
B,Other,"maybe I should market it to some remote control company now . "
B,Minor,"So are are "
C,Task,"That was bound to happen.$ "
D,Other,"Oh comm sad . "
B,Other,"poor little thing . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay comm "
A,Other,"congratulations . "
A,Elicit,"Um . Anything else to say ? "
D,Task,"Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over comm "
A,Other,"Alright . "
D,Task,"its all timed . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Um anybody have "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"I got more master classes comm "
A,Elicit,"anybody else wanna like take a master's class ? "
B,Task,"It's really funny that you got spam in your work emails . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but check it out . "
A,Minor,"So like "
A,Task,"there are all these like links comm they don't go anywhere . "
A,Other,"But all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management . Um just wanna make sure you do . "
D,Task,"No the first one that you sent like I didn't realise that it was a joke "
D,Task,"and I was like why did she send this to us ? "
A,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"It's very it's very work relevant comm "
D,Task,"'cause people send spam a lot . "
A,Task,"It is . "
A,Task,"Yes definitely "
A,Task,"I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website . "
D,Other,"Oh "
D,Task,"here you can you can view . "
A,Minor,". "
B,Minor,"Let's see comm "
B,Elicit,"what did I get through the corporate website ? "
B,Task,"It's just inspiration about circuit boards . "
D,Task,"You can just see what's up . "
A,Other,"Wow . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Other,"it's it's really deep . "
D,Task,"Hold on . "
D,Task,"Takes a little while to get excited to load . "
D,Minor,"That "
D,Task,"the Excel thing is pretty cool . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that is pretty neat . "
D,Task,"Here comm "
A,Task,"I love Excel comm "
D,Minor,"like comm basically "
A,Task,"it's one of my favourite programs . "
D,Task,"it's like inspiration comm "
D,Minor,"basically "
D,Task,"I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and "
D,Task,"that kind of thing comm "
D,Elicit,"see . "
D,Task,"You didn't miss out that much . "
A,Other,"I see comm mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit comm talking about circuit boards . "
A,Other,"Spongy . "
B,Task,"I learned a lot actually . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Oh wow . "
B,Task,"I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to . "
D,Task,"This one was cooler . "
D,Task,"I got a whole table and everything . "
B,Task,"Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders "
B,Minor,"and "
B,Task,"I wrote it all down comm "
B,Task,"because I thought it would be relevant comm like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control comm "
B,Task,"but then they're like comm you don't actually need this "
B,Task,"you just need to talk about the case . "
D,Task,"That's like mine it was like comm would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control ? "
D,Task,"And then it didn't have like any kind of table comm "
D,Minor,"like "
D,Task,"awesome comm "
D,Task,"I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result . "
B,Task,"It's really interesting though . "
A,Task,"I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"We had a lot of the um "
C,Task,"I think . Yeah . "
A,Task,"otherwise the technology today was kinda cool . "
B,Task,"That was really neat how I got emails "
C,Task,"We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much . "
B,Minor,"and "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me "
B,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Other,"If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case comm the different looks of the case comm I would have probably drawn them up comm "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"'Cause we weren't like voting on anything "
D,Task,"and I think usually comm like whiteboards are good comm you know like crossing out ideas comm or like if we had had like a brainstorming period . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it comm "
B,Task,"but with only four people it doesn't really make sense . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"But I thought we were good orally . "
D,Other,"Get crazy . "
B,Task,"I think if you had a larger group "
A,Task,"And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at comm like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"as that's not as necessary to have . "
D,Task,"And these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"'cause we all needed them separately comm kind of on the whiteboards in this room . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Because we're all gonna be working in different places . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"We "
B,Task,"if we were all gonna stay in here all the time comm then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but everyone needs their own comm like specific notes comm I guess . "
A,Minor,"Now "
A,Elicit,"when you were um creating your um prototypes here comm did you work together or did you like do separate projects ? "
C,Task,"Uh we we worked together comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"um but we were making "
C,Minor,"like "
C,Task,"we sort of made different shapes "
C,Task,"and then discussed how the how the buttons might work comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"um and how we could like improve on the on the design . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"it was a bit of both really comm "
B,Task,"we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it "
B,Task,"and I came up with that rhombus shape "
B,Task,"and he came up with the sort of potatoey comm mangoey shape comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and then just went from there really . "
A,Other,"Cool . "
B,Task,"It was fun . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"well done with the management comm I felt well managed . "
A,Other,"Oh thanks . "
C,Task,"I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time comm "
A,Task,"It's kinda fun . "
C,Task,"and second we actually "
C,Task,"we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Minor,"And I "
B,Task,"That happened to me all the time though . "
C,Task,"I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings comm "
C,Task,"so that we we knew where to go on from there . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but we were able to do it regardless comm "
B,Minor,"so . "
B,Other,"I'm not usually a very decisive person comm "
B,Task,"so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes . "
A,Task,"This is what we'll do . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm for some of the meetings comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Especially last time comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"I think the last time we had a lot of information comm but at the same time not quite enough comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"you know what I mean comm "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"like we we couldn't answer every single question . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Um but "
B,Task,"And I I felt the first two meetings comm that I was coming in with no information comm "
B,Minor,"and not sort of "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"made me really like comm ooh I don't know comm throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information "
B,Task,"and then last time it was like the opposite . "
B,Task,"I had so much information and so much to talk about . "
A,Task,"It was interesting what came out like later comm like as I was doing the when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um comm that more points came out from your presentation even . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Um . I'm a little I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a um something for losing the remote comm "
A,Task,"because that was kind of a big point . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"that was something "
B,Minor,"like "
B,Task,"in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like "
A,Minor,"About "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"the problem was comm even when we just were creating from the Excel file comm there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"so there was no "
D,Task,"we could be like yeah comm it has it included . "
B,Minor,"I think we were "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"There was no way for us to have "
A,Minor,"Considered the re "
D,Task,"written down that it was really there . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"it's interesting that they "
B,Task,"I think we really got into it comm "
B,Task,"I mean I got into it as the day went on "
B,Task,"and I got really like comm ooh I'm designing a remote control comm "
B,Elicit,"I dunno if that's just me comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote "
A,Task,"and yet they didn't provide us with information to um we weren't provided with information to discuss that . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology "
A,Minor,"that "
A,Task,"I just don't know what it is comm "
B,Task,"I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them . "
A,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"I dunno . I mean "
B,Task,"we were talking about it and like i in my household at least comm there's only about two places that the remote is ever "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"'cause there's only one T_V_ "
B,Task,"and "
B,Task,"there's only like three chairs . "
D,Task,"That's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys comm "
D,Task,"and I always do comm anyway . "
D,Task,"You'll lose 'em in your pocket comm "
D,Minor,"like "
D,Task,"you just will forget that "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"there's always ways to lose things . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"It d "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"it depends on how organised you are personally comm "
A,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"or like I guess what the setup of the house is too . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"But comm I mean I am notorious for losing my keys comm "
B,Minor,"I just "
B,Task,"I guess I've just never lost the remote . "
B,Task,"I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night "
B,Task,"and couldn't find them . "
B,Task,"'Cause I was putting groceries away . "
D,Task,"That's funny . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"You you're taking stuff from a bag "
B,Task,"and putting them in the refrigerator "
B,Task,"and then go back to my room . "
A,Task,"Can't get in . "
B,Task,"Can't get in comm "
B,Task,"look all around the kitchen . "
B,Task,"Definitely in the vegetable drawer . "
D,Task,"That's funny . "
B,Minor,"So . "
D,Task,"I always do that comm leaving it in my coat comm and then like using a different coat . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"But I guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Can't really take it into the other room . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot comm alien comm pear comm whatever he is comm have a little voice like comm I am located "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Task,"a G_P_S_ system comm internal G_P_S_ . "
D,Other,"Oh man . "
D,Other,"Here you go . "
B,Other,"Although if it's sitting still for too long . "
A,Other,"We should make one that walks by itself . "
B,Minor,"Yes I "
D,Other,"That really could get up and walk away . "
A,Other,"Or or like some crazy like electro-magnet comm that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there . "
B,Minor,"Or little "
B,Other,"Or just just a wheel comm you know . "
B,Minor,"Just if you "
B,Minor,"like "
B,Task,"you'd have a remote for your remote comm "
B,Minor,"that'll . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Minor,"but if you could attach them to the T_V_ comm then you can . "
B,Minor,"zoom "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Hmm . All kinds of possibilities . "
A,Other,"Mm . Okay . "
A,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Task,"I'm just um trying to update my minutes . "
A,Minor,"I decided to "
A,Elicit,"you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary comm rather than like repeating them . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Just gonna make I'm making full minutes comm "
A,Other,"so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"Wow . "
A,Task,"'Cause that seems a little more useful . "
B,Task,"'Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do . "
A,Task,"But I didn't have like information to sloth through either comm so "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I guess "
B,Elicit,"How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you comm "
B,Elicit,"every meeting . "
A,Task,"Most of it comm "
A,Task,"mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I added slides comm um I added a couple slides each time comm "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"but that was about it . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I didn't even think about adding slides comm "
B,Task,"'cause I would just get slides with titles on them "
B,Task,"and fill them all "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"in w "
B,Task,"didn't even think about adding more . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points comm "
A,Task,"but it wouldn't have a slide for each point . "
B,Other,"Ah yeah. . "
A,Task,"And that's the only way I remember that I need to go other that point . "
A,Task,"I know personally when I do PowerPoint comm that's what I do and so "
A,Task,"I had it once comm "
A,Task,"even if it was just like the title of it comm like the three presentations comm and I would do your three . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
D,Elicit,"You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like "
A,Other,"The slogan on it ? "
B,Task,"No comm no comm definitely not . "
A,Task,"No no no . "
D,Other,"Okay "
D,Task,"good . "
B,Minor,"We "
D,Task,"'Cause I was like comm it could go around the outside . "
B,Task,"No comm I don't think we need to "
B,Task,"I think the R_ and R_ comm especially if the yellow and black one . "
A,Task,"I think we just need the um the R_R_ comm "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Is it yellow and blue ? "
B,Task,"Or yellow and blue . "
B,Other,"Lemme go to the web page . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I was just kinda going by the web page comm "
A,Task,"'cause they didn't give me any clear comm like yellow comm grey comm or . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"I guess it is black comm grey . "
D,Task,"Grey is better than black comm "
D,Task,"doesn't look so bumblebeeish . "
A,Task,"I don't really like yellow in general . "
D,Minor,"Hey "
D,Task,"now I understand the random like newsclippings . "
A,Minor,"But it "
B,Task,"Finish meeting now . "
A,Minor,"Wasn't it interesting that um "
A,Task,"I thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um "
A,Task,"the marketing choices comm "
A,Minor,"you know comm like "
D,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"I will "
D,Task,"I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation comm you wouldn't just have like one set of source comm "
A,Task,"that was a bit of a conflict . "
D,Minor,"it's kind of an "
D,Task,"they were so not backed up comm "
D,Task,"it would just be a sentence like we did a survey comm this is what people said . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"S "
D,Task,"mm comm I dunno . "
A,Other,"People are stupid . "
B,Task,"I guess it i it sort of a grey comm "
B,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
B,Task,"Yellow and grey comm "
B,Task,"but then the slogan's in blue . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"we got some grey "
D,Task,"and we got some blue buttons comm "
D,Task,"we're good . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"we don't have the right colour clay anyway . "
A,Minor,"Maybe comm like I don't know . That could always be . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"we're not comm sadly comm going to actually be producing this comm so . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"If they ever come out with potato "
B,Other,"Potato mango shaped remotes . "
D,Minor,"I'm gonna have to "
A,Other,"I'm claiming it intellectual property . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I can't believe a whole day is gone . "
D,Task,"I know . "
B,Task,"I don't feel like it's been that long . "
B,Task,"Get sucked in . "
B,Task,"Mm I haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet . "
