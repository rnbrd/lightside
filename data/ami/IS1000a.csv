C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Or you get it . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"No I don't think so "
C,Task,"it has to be like that "
C,Task,"yeah "
C,Task,"and you have to adjust the length . "
C,Other,"Okay comm and then . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"we uh we will wait for Anna comm a few minutes . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm s yeah comm um . "
D,Other,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yours is well "
C,Task,"I think you can put anywhere you want comm actually . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"I thin "
D,Task,"but the the mic should not "
C,Task,"It's not a directional mic comm anyway . "
B,Task,"I think it should work like this . "
C,Other,"Uh . "
B,Other,"So I will try to get my presentation running . "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Can't help you with that . "
C,Other,"Last . "
B,Other,"It's no matter . "
D,Task,"Okay comm "
D,Minor,"it's y "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Other,"No problem . "
B,Minor,"Ah "
B,Task,"yes . "
D,Other,"Right . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Then press uh al "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"This . "
B,Other,"I don't know . "
D,Elicit,"You know ? "
B,Task,"Just try . "
C,Task,"'Kay . "
B,Minor,"On this normal "
D,Task,"Oh oh . "
C,Task,"Alt F_ five . "
B,Task,"Good . "
B,Task,"Doesn't appear on the screen here . "
D,Other,"Right well "
B,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Wow . Amazing . "
D,Task,"It's working . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Thank you . Uh . "
A,Other,"Hold that . "
B,Minor,"Yes "
B,Task,"and you can put can clip it uh on your "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Somewhere . "
A,Task,"Okay . Mm . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Other,"good morning comm everyone . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Other,"Welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project . "
B,Elicit,"I hope you all have been uh updated about it . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Good . "
C,Other,"So . Yes . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here . "
B,Task,"Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . "
B,Task,"See what our roles are in this project . "
B,Minor,"So comm um "
B,Task,"We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh to communicate and to well comm learn from each other's plans "
B,Other,"uh as I can say "
B,Minor,"um so "
B,Task,"w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools "
B,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"they are also new to me "
B,Task,"I don't know whether you worked with them before . "
B,Task,"Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . "
B,Elicit,"You all know I hope how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Total . "
B,Task,"Uh then we will uh discuss "
B,Elicit,"uh comm well comm how it should be "
B,Elicit,"and uh wh what uh what our new product should look lite like . "
B,Task,"And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting . "
B,Minor,"So . Um "
B,Task,"basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um "
B,Minor,"We "
B,Task,"When you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original . "
B,Minor,"Be uh "
B,Task,"we want to be distinguished comm "
B,Elicit,"mm ? "
B,Task,"People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think comm well that's the product I I need . "
B,Task,"So it needs to be trendy . "
B,Task,"I mean trendy is what people want comm "
B,Task,"so then I w they will buy our product . "
B,Task,"But then comm uh comm it also should work uh user friendly "
B,Task,"and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um "
B,Task,"You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase "
B,Task,"and uh then we will meet again "
B,Task,"and uh discuss this functional design . "
B,Task,"And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this comm the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design "
B,Task,"in which the the final project should get its definite shape . "
B,Minor,"Alright comm "
B,Task,"but first we will do some uh tool training . "
B,Task,"In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks "
B,Task,"and we have here a a a a white-board . "
C,Minor,"Whitebo "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"And um well it should work uh "
B,Task,"I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . "
B,Task,"I didn't find out yet how it work comm "
B,Elicit,"but maybe one of you did comm so Um "
D,Task,"Under documents in the shared folder . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Yes . "
B,Elicit,"Do Do we have to say something about that ? "
B,Task,"I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . "
D,Minor,"And uh comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yes well "
B,Task,"we will then find out ho how it works . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Um . Well comm "
B,Task,"this seems to me comm yes comm some computer program "
B,Task,"but I didn't find it yet . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"we'll come to that later . "
B,Minor,"So comm uh "
B,Task,"now we will try out the white-board we have here . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"I would suggest uh "
D,Task,"Each of us is going . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"yes comm "
B,Task,"um we uh we should try to t to draw on it "
B,Task,"and then well it should be smart some way . "
B,Task,"I I'm not really sure how this works comm but "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Other,"shall I start ? "
A,Task,"Mm . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"you can start it you know . "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"a good idea Mael . "
A,Task,"I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard comm "
A,Task,"but they'll be recording what we write down . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Minor,"i "
C,Minor,"No "
C,Task,"they will record through that . "
C,Task,"There's a sensor over there "
A,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
C,Task,"which is going to record the strokes that you make . "
A,Task,"But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"But it's "
D,Task,"Actually comm I think I cannot go with uh "
B,Minor,"You you "
B,Elicit,"D doesn't it work ? "
B,Minor,"Maybe someo "
B,Task,"Maybe maybe Anna comm maybe you can start . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right . "
A,Other,"I have to draw . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Minor,"L "
B,Task,"Why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board . "
A,Other,"M my my favourite animal . "
A,Other,"Sorry "
A,Task,"this is all tangled up here . "
B,Other,"Oh comm I see uh "
A,Task,"That's better . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Yeah . Yes . Mm . "
B,Task,"So draw it . "
B,Other,"We will try to guess what it is . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"I'm a very bad drawer . "
A,Task,"Weird . "
A,Task,"Um . You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing . "
A,Other,"I'm a bad drawer . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Mm . "
A,Task,"They're ears comm by the way . "
C,Task,"'s a cat . "
A,Elicit,"No . "
A,Task,"Um close though . "
A,Minor,"Okay so "
A,Task,"like a pet animal . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Like a cat . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's like a cat comm "
B,Task,"so I guess it's a cat . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"not a cat though . "
B,Other,"What is this now ? "
C,Other,"Ah you forget about it . "
D,Elicit,"You're on the knife . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"uh I think it's fine . "
C,Other,"I just don't want to carry it off . "
C,Task,"Man comm this wires comm "
C,Elicit,"eh ? "
C,Task,"We need a wireless microphone . "
C,Elicit,"You know ? "
C,Minor,"Pro specially we should "
C,Task,"next project we should take l like that . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . So . "
B,Task,"that's the cat . "
A,Task,"It's not a cat comm "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"it's a dog . "
C,Minor,"So . "
D,Other,"Mael . "
B,Other,"It's a dog . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"but that's also kind of cat comm "
C,Minor,"Oh "
C,Elicit,"the dog doesn't have a tail ? "
B,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
A,Task,"It's got a tail then . "
B,Task,"B bo both predators . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm sure comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"I thought so . The dogs have a tail . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Other,"thank you . "
A,Task,"So do cats . "
B,Elicit,"Uh d did you uh work out cord ? "
A,Task,"And you guessed cats without a tail . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"I think I will go without without it comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"It'll still not extend comm "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"It's not up to that . "
A,Task,"Okay comm there you go . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"what favourite characteristics . Uh . Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . "
A,Elicit,"A horse ? "
C,Task,"It's a horse . "
A,Other,"This is why you're the designer . "
A,Other,"And I'm marketing . "
B,Task,"Yes . Yes comm yes this is Yes definitely a horse . Yes . "
B,Task,"Oh very good . So "
A,Other,"Ah "
B,Minor,"I suppose it "
C,Minor,"Ah "
C,Task,"I think you can put that . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . That's it . "
A,Task,"A blue and black zebra . "
B,Other,"Yes . "
B,Other,"Can you can meet them in Africa comm I think . "
B,Task,"Yes . Very good . So "
A,Other,"The very rare blue zebras . Yes . "
C,Other,"I'll tell to get it off my "
B,Task,"Ma Matthew ? "
C,Other,"Uh ? "
C,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"You got a lot of room here . "
B,Minor,"Maybe "
A,Task,"You can probably reach . "
C,Minor,"Oh "
C,Minor,"y "
C,Task,"it's not for that . "
A,Elicit,"No ? "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Elicit,"I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael . "
C,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"So what should I draw ? "
C,Other,"Mm . "
C,Task,"He has already to do cat . "
A,Task,"I took a dog . "
A,Elicit,"Um . A mouse ? "
B,Task,"This looks likes a cat who has been driven over . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics comm "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"Yes comm the moustache . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"That's that's definitely a cat . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Uh yeah . "
D,Task,"And i Th They like to sleep comm "
D,Elicit,"that's why you said you they are like this . "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's quite comm you know relaxed situation . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yes comm okay . "
D,Task,"She has the small legs . "
B,Other,"Th thank you comm Matthew . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Thank you comm Matthew . "
A,Task,"It's a very big rat . Or a very small cat . "
D,Task,"Perfect . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Other,"a rat comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yes comm this is certain uh some contribution to our project . "
D,Minor,"And you comm "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
A,Task,"Your turn . "
B,Minor,"So . Let's see . "
B,Elicit,"Which animal has not been drawn yet . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"you've all drawn land animals comm "
B,Other,"so why not draw an animal from the water . "
D,Task,"A bird . "
D,Other,"Okay comm in the water . "
A,Minor,"Ah "
A,Task,"I don't know what that is . "
A,Minor,"It's a bit "
D,Other,"Mm . "
A,Task,"It's a bit hard to guess . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Put it colours . "
D,Task,"Maybe it would help us . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Elicit,"The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ? "
D,Task,"With different pen widths . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm.$ "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"Oh comm "
A,Task,"it's a shark now . "
D,Other,"Ah "
D,Task,"it's a shark comm "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"yes comm why not ? "
B,Task,"Good idea . "
C,Minor,"Ah "
C,Task,"it's a baby shark comm it looks to me comm "
C,Other,"you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish comm no ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Now it's a swordfish . "
B,Task,"Why not . A swordfish . "
D,Task,"You have some in in Australia comm "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Other,"Swordfish . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um comm maybe . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"I've never seen one comm no . "
D,Other,"Oh well . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"I hope it still works . "
D,Task,"Perfect . "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"I dunno if we need to spend time on that comm actually "
D,Minor,"But uh "
C,Task,"You should go for the next one it seems to me . "
B,Minor,"W Well comm "
B,Task,"this uh this tool seemed to work . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm exactly comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Let's continue to uh to the real stuff . "
D,Task,"Wow . "
B,Task,"Um our project uh finance uh thing . "
B,Task,"Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros comm "
B,Task,"so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael comm keep in mind uh uh uh People uh "
C,Task,"Twenty four . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um "
D,Task,"Per remote control comm "
B,Task,"product . "
D,Task,"yeah ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Per project . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Okay . Um "
B,Task,"more interesting for our company of course comm p uh profit aim comm about fifty million Euro . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things . "
B,Task,"Uh we will try to uh "
B,Task,"to get at a international market "
B,Minor,"uh so um "
B,Task,"it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America comm "
C,Other,"Ah yeah comm the sale man comm four million . "
B,Task,"maybe some uh Asian countries . "
B,Task,"Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . "
D,Task,"So it's half of the selling price comm if I am good in mathematics . "
B,Task,"Yes comm of course . "
B,Minor,"Uh um I mean "
B,Task,"we still have to uh to make a profit comm "
B,Elicit,"huh ? "
D,Task,"Of course . "
C,Task,"They have to sell at least four million to make a profit "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"You all have to be paid . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Ah "
B,Other,"Excuse me ? "
C,Minor,"we have to make "
C,Task,"we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . Fifty mill "
D,Other,"Oh "
D,Other,"you're g very good in mathematics . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yes comm indeed . "
D,Other,"Four million . "
B,Minor,"So uh well "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think w when we are working on the international market comm uh in principle it has enough customers "
B,Minor,"uh so "
B,Task,"when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim comm I think . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"that about finance . "
B,Task,"And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control "
B,Task,"and uh well keep in mind this this first point comm it has to be original comm "
B,Task,"it has to be trendy comm "
B,Task,"it has to be user friendly . "
B,Elicit,"Um comm maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Of course it should have a on off button . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yes comm well "
B,Task,"i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control . "
A,Minor,"Mm . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"s "
C,Elicit,"and it depends what application you are using it for . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"You might need uh "
B,Task,"We wer we were thinking television . Uh . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"We are targ targeting the television set . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"you need to record the channels . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way comm "
B,Task,"Yes comm yes . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Th th that's very handy "
B,Task,"I I always miss it "
B,Task,"and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number comm especially when you have a lot of channels . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Minor,"And "
A,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm and "
D,Minor,"And uh just before starting the detailed discussion comm maybe we "
D,Elicit,"are the marketing guy ? Or "
A,Task,"I'm marketing . "
D,Minor,"th "
C,Task,"Marketing . "
D,Task,"So you are the marketing . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"And you are in the u use user interface uh design . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"So just yeah "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I wanted to to be sure . "
C,Other,"Sure . "
D,Task,"And I I'm the the industrial designer "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"okay . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Because I I don't know you very well comm actually comm but yeah . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"I'm Matthew . You know . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Mael . "
C,Minor,"Matth s uh "
D,Other,"Happy to meet you . "
A,Task,"Anna . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Anna . "
D,Other,"It's very uh "
C,Elicit,"And "
B,Task,"A and I'm Nanne . "
C,Task,"um uh Matthew comm yeah . "
C,Task,"I thi think you know me comm "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Uh so yeah uh Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face . "
C,Elicit,"yeah ? "
C,Task,"right yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"So . Um "
B,Minor,"S "
C,Minor,"So . "
D,Minor,"So mm "
B,Minor,"S s "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"Are there some other very important things to to do well comm "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"I "
B,Elicit,"to specify in this first phase of of the project . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"the browse function comm as you m mentioned . "
A,Minor,"Mm . Yeah . Oth yeah . "
C,Task,"And uh comm you'd need the usual ones comm like the changing the volume comm changing the the channel "
C,Minor,"and then you uh "
B,Minor,"Yes . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . "
C,Task,"Tomorrow you might have a some more functions "
C,Task,"which might come through that comm so "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Elicit,"Like what ? "
D,Elicit,"Like internet on the on T_V_ ? "
C,Task,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I_P_O_ or . "
C,Task,"Now we are looking for "
C,Task,"television things or I_P_ . "
C,Task,"For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Ah "
C,Task,"it's it's it's it's coming up comm actually . The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up . "
B,Minor,"Mm comm well uh "
B,Minor,"I I think "
B,Task,"Uh w y you two should should comm I think comm think this over uh w espec what comm what functionality . "
D,Minor,"Actually comm yeah "
C,Minor,"Let's Let's take "
D,Minor,"w "
D,Task,"Of course comm "
D,Minor,"and first before um designing the func "
D,Minor,"well "
D,Task,"thinking about the functionalities comm we need to know what are the user requirements . "
A,Task,"Mm . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um then if they need internet comm then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_ . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But Ninety percent of the time comm ninety nine percent of the time comm people will be using the main functions comm the volume comm the different channels comm "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"we can have all the fancy things as well "
A,Task,"but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use . "
B,Task,"Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit comm "
B,Task,"so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out comm I think . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"twenty five Euro you expect a quite comm well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Oh "
C,Task,"in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that "
C,Task,"and you know comm you you sell their product as well as your product with them comm you know . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to "
D,Task,"but w w we want to design a new one . Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"No comm "
C,Other,"it's okay comm yeah I understand . "
C,Task,"So we need some numbering buttons comm some teletext things "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"and then um "
D,Minor,"The "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"the main is browsing . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"but but but ab about the spec the buttons comm the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Uh I would like to get this wrapped up "
B,Other,"and go to an end of this meeting . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"we are alread mm . Mm . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"you know now the basic the basic things . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"well "
B,Task,"just just for the next meeting comm um "
C,Minor,"L "
B,Task,"well comm uh comm you wor yes comm work on a design comm "
B,Task,"keep it general comm "
B,Task,"I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Um you will be working on on technical function design comm so "
C,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
B,Task,"And uh you and you and uh uh uh well comm think about requirements comm "
B,Elicit,"eh ? "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Does it need internet comm "
B,Elicit,"or or do do we stay at "
C,Minor,"Stam . "
B,Elicit,"basic basic television uh interface . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So comm uh "
B,Task,"I think we should now all go work uh uh at this "
B,Task,"and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Perfect . "
B,Task,"next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh . "
B,Task,"K keep it in mind . "
