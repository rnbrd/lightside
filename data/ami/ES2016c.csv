A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,". "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Elicit,"Is everyone here ? "
D,Task,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"This is our conceptual design meeting . "
A,Minor,"And "
A,Task,"I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . "
A,Task,"Um then each of you will have your presentation comm "
A,Task,"um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . "
A,Task,"And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Other,"I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . "
A,Task,"Um comm we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . "
A,Task,"Um we decided that comm or we know that we need to use company colours comm company logo . "
A,Minor,"Um and "
A,Task,"our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . "
A,Task,"Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . "
A,Task,"People thought their remotes were ugly comm um "
A,Minor,"um "
A,Task,"that remotes zap a lot . "
A,Task,"Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons . "
A,Minor,"Um and that they often lose the "
A,Task,"it's easy to lose a remote . "
A,Task,"Um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . Um "
A,Task,"And uh some sort of locator . "
A,Task,"Either a button or tracking device . Um "
A,Task,"And that it should look different than what's out there . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . "
A,Task,"The younger people said they wanted it comm older people did not . "
A,Task,"Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it comm "
A,Task,"and that it was probably a gimmick comm that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . Um "
A,Task,"Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . "
A,Task,"Um the simple versus the um the complex . "
A,Task,"The simple one being better for a user comm the complex better for an engineer . Um "
A,Task,"Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote comm something simple . "
A,Elicit,"Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote comm because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . "
A,Task,"Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . "
A,Task,"Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . "
A,Task,"Have it s be something that looks different . "
A,Task,"And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . "
A,Task,"Um from energy source comm um uh what we would use . "
A,Task,"Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . Um "
A,Task,"How that would power the remote and the lamp . "
A,Task,"If we were to to have one . "
A,Task,"Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip comm which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . Um "
A,Task,"I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um "
A,Task,"Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . "
A,Task,"And with a comm just a few buttons . "
A,Task,"Just the basics . "
A,Task,"And with a scrolling um function also . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,"and I will leave that comm leave it at that . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"Marketing ? "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We're watching trends . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Can I have your cable please ? "
A,Task,"I suppose that you can have this . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
D,Task,"Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . "
D,Task,"Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . "
D,Task,"I was given a brief executive summary comm and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . "
D,Other,"And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . "
D,Task,"Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design comm "
D,Task,"which I think we've kind of already discussed before . "
D,Task,"Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . "
D,Task,"And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own comm but this just backs it up . "
D,Task,"And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . "
D,Task,"As far as fashion update comm we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths comm shoes and furniture . "
D,Task,"So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote comm "
D,Task,"but we can try . "
D,Task,"Um and also comm as opposed to last year comm this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . "
D,Task,"Okay so from that um comm as we've already said comm we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . "
D,Task,"Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . "
D,Task,"But I think that comm even if it's very subtle comm we need to kind of trick our consumers comm "
D,Task,"so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and "
D,Task,"Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . "
D,Task,"Um for technologically innovative comm we've talked about the tracking device . "
D,Task,"We brought up the idea of having two pieces comm which we could discuss further . "
D,Task,"And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface comm discussing some of those comm um that we could change a little bit . "
D,Task,"We need to keep it simple comm have limited buttons comm "
D,Task,"which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . "
D,Task,"Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . "
D,Task,"I don't know comm "
D,Task,"I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . "
C,Task,"Oh it was sort of banana shaped . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . Right . "
A,Task,"A banana shape ? "
D,Task,"Or with exterior designs . "
D,Task,"But my question is comm I mean the stereotypically speaking comm you kind of picture males with their remote controls comm "
D,Task,"and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . "
D,Task,"So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable comm "
D,Task,"or I don't know comm different options for female comm male target groups . "
D,Task,"And then the spongy feel . "
D,Task,"I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . "
D,Task,"C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . "
D,Task,"So that's that . "
A,Minor,"So possibly like a uh comm "
B,Task,"Alright . "
A,Other,"sorry comm "
A,Other,"just to butt in for a second . "
A,Task,"Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? "
D,Task,"That's what I was thinking yeah . "
C,Task,"Those like comm yeah comm sort of spongy ones . "
A,Task,"You have one with a flag comm and one with a banana and one that's a spongy "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So when you buy your remote you can buy "
A,Task,"feel to it . "
A,Minor,"You can "
D,Task,"various coverings . "
A,Task,"Mm various covers . "
C,Elicit,"What's it called ? "
C,Minor,"Cust you "
D,Task,"Personalise your remote . "
C,Task,"personalised comm yeah . "
A,Other,"We could leave that to the cover department . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"We all know they've got nothing to do all day . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Why can't I see the "
C,Task,"crazy . "
C,Other,"Um yeah I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to comm will use the comm consumer will use the actual device . "
C,Task,"Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent comm um comm try and get some inspiration . "
C,Task,"But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . "
C,Task,"Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they comm the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology comm where you can program questions into such devices . "
C,Task,"They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question comm you program the answer comm and the machine responds accordingly . "
C,Minor,"Um okay . "
C,Task,"There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . "
C,Task,"Um there's a graphical use comm where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . "
C,Task,"A command line where you obviously type things in comm and you get a response . "
C,Task,"Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . "
C,Task,"You can't really see that picture well comm but there's various different remotes comm once again with lots of different buttons on comm making it more complicated . "
C,Task,"So comm then I had a look at new products that are on the market . "
C,Task,"Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . "
C,Task,"Um this is the voice comm there is a voice recognition remote control comm which can control mus multiple devices . "
C,Minor,"I have a "
C,Task,"there is a picture . "
C,Task,"You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . "
C,Task,"Store up to eighty speech samples comm controls four devices comm T_V_ comm cable comm satellite comm V_C_R_ comm D_V_D_ and audio . "
C,Task,"And you can record your own v verbal labels comm that are connected to remote control functions . "
C,Task,"So the technology is there . "
C,Task,"Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting comm where there has scroll down functions on the side . "
C,Task,"You can sort of just make those out . "
C,Task,"And then on the right is obviously an iPod comm "
C,Task,"which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there comm "
C,Task,"and really is comm "
C,Task,"and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . "
C,Task,"That is a possibility . "
C,Task,"And nothing's simpler really . "
C,Task,"Um then there's things like this comm which is a a a kid's remote comm "
C,Task,"where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . "
C,Task,"So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . "
C,Task,"And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . "
C,Task,"So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components comm "
C,Task,"maybe it can have more components you know comm different remotes . "
C,Task,"Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices comm as to what comm you know comm things you use . "
C,Task,"Sometimes an arrow pointing down comm which may suggest volume down comm could become confused just as a V_ for volume . "
C,Task,"Just little things like that comm which would need to be made clear in the design . "
C,Task,"Um I think comm d carrying on from what I've already said comm a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . "
C,Task,"Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing comm where if it was to have a speech recognition thing comm "
C,Task,"you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . "
C,Task,"And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier comm as the actual remote . "
C,Minor,"Um I don't "
C,Task,"it could be a graphical display comm the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . "
C,Task,"Stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . "
C,Task,"And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . "
C,Task,"And that is it . "
C,Minor,"Why am I "
C,Task,"Oh yeah . "
C,Minor,"Just . "
C,Other,"Where are we ? Uh . "
C,Other,"Just to sort of show you . "
C,Task,"M they've even got things like that . "
C,Task,"Huge things . "
C,Task,"Which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ? "
B,Task,"That's industrial design for cranes comm stuff like that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Dunno . "
C,Task,"And that yeah . "
B,Task,"Makes sense comm makes sense . "
A,Elicit,"Notice the giant dog bone shape ? "
A,Task,"Also good for animals . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"See . "
C,Minor,"things . "
C,Minor,". "
C,Other,"Why's my screen crazy ? "
B,Minor,"Uh "
B,Other,"Well let's see . "
B,Other,"I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . "
B,Task,"Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there comm and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . "
B,Task,"I've more information on possible materials um as well . "
B,Task,"What we can and cannot do . "
B,Task,"Um but let's just wait for this to load up "
B,Other,"and I'll show you what we're talking about here . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"The details of the components' design comm as you can see there comm what we have is the board comm main board of the remote control . "
B,Task,"The underside comm that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really "
B,Task,"top left side you can see the chip comm which is the comm what we were talking about comm this was is the device to recognise the signals the input comm "
B,Task,"and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal comm "
B,Task,"which later on is being comm is being transferred to a infrared lamp "
B,Task,"which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television "
B,Task,"which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . Um "
B,Task,"So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . "
B,Task,"Its job is to wait for you to press a key comm then to translate that key press into infrared light signals comm um that are received by the television . "
B,Task,"When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . "
B,Task,"The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . "
B,Task,"It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . "
B,Task,"Right . Pretty clear . "
B,Task,"Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . "
B,Task,"The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light comm and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . "
B,Task,"This is the circuit board from the other side . "
B,Task,"Um the lower part of it comm "
B,Elicit,"I don't know if you can see that properly comm "
B,Task,"with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . "
B,Task,"Um you can see the circuit board itself . "
B,Task,"That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . "
B,Task,"Um what you do is you have comm don't have cables comm but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . "
B,Task,"These are the actual keys that are being pressed . "
B,Task,"They close the electric circuit . "
B,Task,"That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . "
B,Task,"That would be behind here . "
B,Task,"Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that "
B,Task,"amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . "
B,Task,"Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . "
B,Task,"Um the way it works is that you have the keys here . "
B,Task,"The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side comm which closes the circuit here . "
B,Task,"And thus gives on the signal . "
B,Task,"Now this is the simple version . "
B,Task,"Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . "
B,Task,"We are talking something more complicated of course comm it's going to be more expensive as well . "
B,Task,"And not only that . "
B,Task,"Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell comm or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . "
B,Task,"Um I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic comm "
B,Task,"rubber comm as well . "
B,Task,"Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . "
B,Task,"So it's pretty squishy . "
B,Task,"That would that would serve that purpose . "
D,Elicit,"Spongy ? "
B,Task,"Um we could also use wood comm or titanium . "
A,Elicit,"What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ? "
B,Other,"Oh fya "
B,Task,"I don't have an information on that . "
B,Task,"However our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium comm so I assume comm I'm comm I was given an okay to use it . "
B,Minor,"It certainly is an expensive material comm "
B,Task,"I'm aware of that comm "
B,Task,"but I was given an okay . "
B,Task,"But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . "
B,Task,"Now let's first go through the list with the materials . "
B,Task,"So we what we can use is plastic comm rubber comm wood and titanium . "
B,Task,"Can also mix these . "
B,Task,"Um as for the energy source comm um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . "
B,Task,"Um what we could use is comm or what I was offered comm or what we could use comm is a basic bateer battery . "
B,Elicit,"Right ? "
B,Task,"Uh a dynamo . "
B,Task,"Interestingly enough . "
B,Task,"Um we could use solar cells . "
B,Task,"Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . "
B,Task,"Such as like watches you know . Where you just move them "
B,Task,"m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . "
B,Task,"So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"Um solar cell is interesting . "
B,Task,"May fail though comm every here and there . "
C,Elicit,"Would you have to leave it by the window ? "
B,Task,"Mm . Yeah "
C,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,". Or you know you lose it comm it lies behind the couch for a week "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"and yeah mm . "
B,Minor,"Always the you "
A,Task,"Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so "
B,Other,"But "
D,Task,"Y probably not yeah . "
B,Task,"exactly . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um the kinetic energy thing um might work comm um but the same problem . "
B,Task,"You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . "
B,Task,"So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . "
B,Task,"Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . "
B,Task,"We don't need that then . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"However "
B,Task,"our interface options are push-buttons . "
B,Task,"In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . "
B,Task,"And they are possible . "
B,Task,"We have an okay for scroll wheels . "
B,Minor,"Okay . Um "
B,Task,"however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . "
B,Task,"This however may exclude certain um materials . "
B,Task,"If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control comm then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . "
B,Task,"Hence we might not be able to put it in there . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"There's also restrictions to comm when it comes to the chip . "
B,Task,"If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented comm um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . "
B,Task,"I don't have any details to comm when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . "
B,Task,"I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip comm "
B,Task,"but that's not up to me to decide really . "
B,Task,"So that's for the for the scroll wheel . "
B,Task,"Um it limits our choice "
B,Task,"and squishy is hip comm so I'd say rather not go for for that . "
B,Other,"Let's see now . "
B,Minor,"Um um "
B,Task,"solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . "
B,Task,"But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells comm I assume "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"Or is anybody still "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go . "
B,Task,"alright . "
D,Task,"No . Hmm . "
B,Task,"Alright . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . "
B,Task,"We would just be able to make it flat and "
B,Minor,"and um yeah "
B,Task,"a straight design pretty much . "
B,Task,"Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions . "
C,Task,"Would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing "
C,Task,"y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Like a covering . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic . "
C,Elicit,"But then where do people hold it ? "
C,Task,"Just all be sort of spongy . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts comm so they can remove it . "
C,Minor,"So you "
C,Elicit,"as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it comm like a screen ? "
C,Elicit,"Like the iPod ? "
B,Task,"You can have an L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Task,"Um but therefore no rubber will be used . "
C,Task,"Right . "
B,Elicit,"Alright ? "
B,Task,"So plastic yes comm titanium yes comm but this will of course influence the form . "
B,Task,"With plastic comm as I understand it comm you can use any form . "
B,Task,"Um latex "
B,Task,"is tricky . "
B,Task,"Or rubber "
B,Task,"and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . "
B,Task,"So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular comm uh add an L_C_D_ screen comm and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or wood even . "
B,Task,"Um if you wanna make it a particular shape comm use plastic . "
B,Task,"Add an L_C_D_ screen comm add a scroll wheel comm that'll be fine . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or make it just push-buttons . "
B,Task,"Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . "
B,Task,"Maybe not the nicest feel . "
B,Task,"Or not much originality really . "
A,Elicit,"So the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? "
A,Task,"Or the rubbery we cannot ? "
B,Task,"With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it comm "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"but we cannot add scroll wheels comm and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"That's the tricky thing . "
C,Task,"Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen comm "
C,Task,"and then j just sort of that initial shape we had comm just which is uh sort of banana-esque . "
C,Task,"So that's thing if we did it yellow . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . "
C,Minor,"They wouldn't have any "
C,Task,"they're just on the exterior . "
C,Task,"They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . "
A,Elicit,"Is that an option comm a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? "
B,Task,"S Certainly can be done yes . "
B,Task,"Um yeah . "
B,Task,"if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Like say just the underside or so then it can be done . "
B,Task,"I assume . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"The fruit design um "
B,Task,"How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? "
B,Task,"Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"but uh give it like the surface of "
B,Task,"an orange comm banana comm whatever . "
B,Task,"You name it . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"What about a smell ? "
B,Minor,"Just design-wise . "
A,Task,"T to the remote ? "
B,Other,"Mm . Nice one . "
C,Task,"You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . "
C,Task,"In different ye yellows . "
D,Task,"Bright citrus colours yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I don't suppose we have to stick to co "
B,Task,"Well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though comm "
C,Task,"Stick to the colours yeah . "
D,Task,"Oh yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Yellow and grey . "
B,Task,"that's yellow and grey . "
A,Task,"Yellow and grey . "
B,Elicit,"So what have we comm "
B,Task,"lemon comm banana comm is "
C,Task,"Mm grapefruit . "
A,Task,"Grapefruit . "
B,Task,"Grapefruit "
B,Task,"is what we'd go for comm when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . "
B,Minor,"But mm . "
A,Task,"I would say comm if I were to make a decision comm I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,". "
A,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous comm "
D,Minor,"like "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well we have it banana-shaped already comm kind of . "
D,Task,"Well we kinda do yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And if it's yellow ? "
B,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"and if it if it was done yellow comm which is a company colour . "
A,Task,"It's it's yellow . It's curved . "
B,Task,"I it's yellow . "
D,Task,"Grey buttons yeah . "
B,Task,"Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ? "
A,Minor,"It's sort of "
A,Task,"couple of couple of grey stripes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . "
C,Minor,"On the the gr "
C,Task,"the rubbery grips could be grey . "
A,Task,"It would look like a banana just sitting on their table . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"There you go . "
A,Minor,"Rather than rather th "
C,Minor,"It could "
C,Task,"and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl comm on the coffee table comm "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"and then people would always know where it was . "
A,Task,"Maybe the holder comm if we were to have a holder comm it could be shaped like a fruit . "
D,Task,"Nice . "
D,Task,"Could look like a fruit bowl . "
B,Other,"It could be an ape . "
A,Task,"Could be comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . "
A,Task,"we could have a variety of options here . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Do you have more to your presentation ? "
B,Task,"That's pretty much it . "
B,Task,"I informed you about the materials comm what the interior has to look like comm and what the limitations to certain materials are on "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
B,Other,"there you go . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"I'm gonna plug in here real quick . "
B,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"If I could . "
B,Other,"Hang on . "
B,Other,"There you go . "
A,Task,"Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Other,"ow . Ow . "
D,Elicit,"So is the two piece idea out ? "
D,Elicit,"Or have we not decided ? "
C,Task,"Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery . "
C,Task,"And the base station might not be necessary . "
D,Task,"Oh right okay . "
B,Task,"Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base comm having one of them be a base station comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions comm or you take out the smaller piece . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"We can still do that . "
B,Task,"However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So um which then comm as I understand it comm would probably limit the comm limit again the the the use of certain materials comm because they would be too expensive . "
B,Task,"Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them comm or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button "
B,Task,"design which we saw there . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"But could be done comm of course . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . "
A,Task,"Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source comm um the chip-on-print comm and the case . "
A,Task,"Probably case um material . "
A,Task,"And probably a shape also . "
A,Task,"Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape comm what comm what the type is . "
A,Task,"And what kind of supplements we'll have . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Energy source I think we've comm I think we've decided batteries comm although not exciting comm are probably our best bet . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"And we have five minutes . "
B,Task,"Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print comm as I said comm the the more advanced features you want comm um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . "
B,Task,"Uh if you want just a normal button version comm the chip-on-print is gonna be "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"a cheap one . "
B,Elicit,"Right ? "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Um I guess we should pick the case then . "
A,Task,"If we go with the plasticky case comm or the the plastic case comm um then the chip-on-print is still kind of comm we could have either or . "
A,Task,"We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ? "
D,Task,"Well what about what you said comm like putting the "
C,Minor,"Just "
C,Minor,"just maybe "
D,Task,"finger grips just on top of the plastic ? "
C,Task,"yeah . Just a little bit of . "
A,Minor,". "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So we would comm "
A,Elicit,"we would have the L_C_D_ screen ? "
B,Task,"as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls comm yes . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"So I guess the case would be plastic comm "
A,Task,"with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . "
A,Elicit,"It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,". "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"M more of a l lamination perhaps . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So then for the scroll comm are we going for the iPod type ? "
C,Task,"Yeah I think so . "
D,Other,"Yeah ? "
C,Minor,"I think "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? "
B,Task,"Yes . It does . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"I guess that comm is that comm is that about it ? "
A,Elicit,"So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ? "
B,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . Um "
A,Task,"Here's what's gonna be going on . Um "
A,Task,"Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um "
A,Task,"Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . "
B,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . "
A,Task,"And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh "
A,Task,"maybe and and get us a prototype . "
A,Task,"Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . "
A,Minor,"So that "
A,Task,"basically just be working on the prototype comm uh we'll accomplish your other two actions . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Let's do it . "
