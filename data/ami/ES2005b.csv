Speaker,DialogAct,Text
C,Task,"Um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you comm "
C,Task,"however comm um there are some changes that I've got from on high "
C,Minor,"that um "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"are a bit uh "
C,Task,"well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So the all in one idea goes out the window . "
C,Minor,"And they require that the uh "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"actually I'll get to that at the end point number four comm "
C,Task,"um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . "
C,Task,"So um comm presentations comm "
C,Elicit,"were you anybody got comm raring to go ? "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Raring to go ? "
C,Task,"Okay . Good stuff . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"Um . So how "
C,Other,"Oh I need to plug you in . "
B,Minor,"S "
D,Other,"Wow . "
C,Task,"Just about . "
A,Other,"It's a inspired design . "
B,Elicit,"Sh do you want me to hold it ? "
C,Other,"Uh there we go comm "
C,Task,"just screw 'em on in . "
C,Task,"Gonna have to swap them round so "
C,Task,"now comm it was function F_ eight . "
B,Elicit,"So comm after that ? "
B,Other,"F_ eight . "
C,Task,"That's the wee blue one . "
B,Other,"f oh sorry F_ eight . "
C,Task,"Blue one F_ eight . "
C,Task,"Should do it comm good one . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh comm me again comm Rajan the Marketing Expert . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out comm "
B,Other,"sorry comm yeah sure . "
C,Task,"Hold on comm sorry . "
C,Task,"and if you just click that it'll go ahead comm one at a time . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh actually comm sorry I have to see the other comm sorry . "
C,Other,"Sorry comm uh . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm thank you . "
B,Task,"Uh comm yes comm I have to look at the uh market potential for this product comm "
B,Task,"uh comm like consumer likings and everything comm "
B,Task,"what is the potential for this product "
B,Task,"and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? "
B,Minor,"Then "
C,Task,"P press F_ five to start it first . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Task,"Okay . Yeah comm I can comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Other,"Jesus . "
B,Task,"Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey . "
B,Task,"A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings comm what they prefer what they not prefer comm w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . "
B,Task,"And what we got was comm we found that if you uh comm what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . "
B,Task,"Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . "
B,Task,"They are not so good looking . "
B,Task,"So comm we have to put stress on this comm "
B,Task,"uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design comm uh should be appropriate comm should be good looking for the consumers . "
B,Task,"And yes that's wi uh this will definitely comm this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . "
B,Task,"Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . "
B,Minor,"So even if the available market goes for the available "
B,Task,"uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros comm "
B,Task,"which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs comm then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . "
C,Task,"Excellent . "
B,Minor,"Then "
B,Task,"And the second thing comm some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls comm "
B,Task,"but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want comm what they operate comm rather than making it too complicated . "
B,Task,"Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons comm "
B,Task,"so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky comm too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . "
B,Task,"Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . "
B,Task,"So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . "
B,Task,"So we have to take care of this fact also . "
B,Minor,"Then . "
B,Task,"Uh it was function I want to go to . "
C,Task,"Oh you wanna go back ? Just escape . "
B,Task,"Uh comm escape comm okay "
B,Other,"thank you . "
B,Task,"Then if we look at this slide comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"uh these are in your shared documents comm you can see comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"like "
B,Other,"Uh comm sorry . "
D,Other,"So comm sorry "
D,Other,"I was just gonna say comm "
D,Elicit,"what was the question for this ? "
D,Elicit,"Or is are you coming on to that ? "
B,Task,"Ah t look all the market potential comm what uh how we should design consu our remote controls comm what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit comm enhance our sales . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"So these percentages are are what ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm these are different age group persons "
B,Minor,"like uh "
B,Other,"sorry comm "
B,Other,"I can open it in another way . "
C,Task,"Okay . Speech recognition . "
B,Task,"Uh comm yes . "
B,Task,"If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not comm we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point comm like for speech recognition in a remote control . "
B,Task,"So we can emphasise on this point also like comm "
B,Task,"because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five comm "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T_V_ are belong to this age group . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"So we should look "
C,Task,"We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well . "
B,Task,"Yeah . We can look at that that factor also comm so yes . "
C,Task,"Uh comm which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual comm sort of . "
D,Minor,"Mm comm mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So comm and "
B,Minor,"And then "
C,Other,"Fifteen to twe "
B,Task,"Yes . I think so . "
B,Task,"Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . "
B,Task,"They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . "
B,Task,"So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls "
B,Task,"and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn . "
B,Task,"They need not to have any comm much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . "
B,Task,"So um this is all about "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"uh market potential by me . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm yes comm "
B,Other,"th thank you . "
C,Other,"Okay comm thank you . "
C,Elicit,"Um comm follow on with Helen ? "
C,Other,"Yeah please . "
D,Other,"Yep comm sure comm that's cool comm um "
B,Task,"Yeah we have to take that out . "
C,Task,"Oh comm so we do yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Other,"Fun and games . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Task,"Don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough . "
B,Other,"Uh sorry comm "
C,Task,"I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well . "
B,Minor,"I have . "
B,Task,"Brian comm this one also I . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay . "
B,Other,"Thank you very much Brian . "
B,Other,"If you want me to help comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Um comm yep . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Okay comm and then what do I press comm F_ eight ? "
B,Task,"Uh F_ eight . Function F_ eight . "
C,Task,"Function F_ eight . "
D,Task,"Oh right . "
B,Minor,"Mm s . "
D,Task,"Okay comm cool . "
B,Task,"It's not coming . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"Function F_ eight comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . No signal . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Computer . "
C,Task,"There you go . "
B,Task,"Computer adjusting comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . Cool . "
D,Elicit,"Okay and then how do I press the the big one comm to get it on to the big "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh F_ five . "
D,Other,"F_ five "
D,Elicit,"and I press that again to get it off as well do I ? "
C,Task,"Um comm F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing . "
B,Task,"Escape . "
D,Task,"Okay comm so um I'm the interface design designer comm "
D,Task,"User Interface Designer sorry comm "
D,Task,"uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user "
D,Minor,"and um I'm I'm also "
D,Task,"I want to point out that our motto comm put the fashion in electronics comm "
D,Task,"so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable comm it's a big concern of ours . "
D,Elicit,"Okay comm and how do I press n just the next button ? "
C,Task,"Uh just a left uh "
D,Elicit,"The arrow ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"left mouse button . "
D,Task,"So um I looked at existing designs "
D,Task,"and also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like comm what people dislike . "
D,Task,"Um and what people fashionable comm because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our T_V_ I think . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So um what they like and what they find fashionable . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"And ergonomics comm "
D,Minor,"we said um comm "
D,Task,"I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself comm "
D,Task,"but um maybe that comes up comm "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
C,Task,"That can come under Arlo as well . "
D,Task,"And the findings comm well "
D,Task,"the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . "
D,Task,"That's what people want to do . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Um comm so they need to be included comm um comm "
D,Task,"but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones . "
D,Task,"I don't know how to get to them comm "
D,Elicit,"do I press F_ five is it ? escape ? "
C,Task,"Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar . "
D,Task,"Oh okay comm cool . "
D,Task,"I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one . "
D,Task,"These are two leading um remote controls at the moment . "
C,Minor,"Uh okay . "
D,Task,"You know they're grey comm "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"they've "
D,Task,"I mean this one's got loads of buttons comm "
D,Task,"it's hard to tell from here what they actually do comm "
D,Task,"and they don't look very exciting at all . "
D,Task,"Um comm personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use comm "
D,Task,"it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"um comm but there you go comm that's what we're up against comm "
D,Task,"and I think we can do much better than that . "
A,Task,"Of course . "
D,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"We hope so . "
D,Other,"hang on . "
D,Other,"F_ five comm "
D,Other,"okay comm sorry . "
D,Task,"Personal preferences . "
D,Task,"Um comm well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important comm um "
C,Task,"Yeah comm particularly if we've uh there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well . "
D,Task,"Uh-huh . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And um I thought not too edgy and like a box comm "
D,Task,"more kind of hand-held more um not as uh computery and "
C,Task,"Organic . "
D,Task,"or organic comm yeah comm more organic shape I think . "
D,Task,"Um simple designs comm like the last one we just saw comm "
D,Task,"not too many buttons "
D,Task,"and as Raj pointed out comm only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . "
C,Task,"Sales comm . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Um comm hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important "
D,Task,"because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen comm anyway comm so um "
C,Task,"Yeah it's like a comm yeah . "
C,Task,"It's . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm no seven inches isn't that big "
D,Task,"but um anyway um so hand-held and portable "
D,Task,"and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that comm "
C,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"so maybe we forget about that . "
C,Task,"And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It's for one T_V_ oh right okay comm sure . "
D,Task,"And so the last thing I thought "
D,Task,"w which I quickly mentioned in the other one "
D,Task,"was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people comm like glow-in-the-dark "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Exactly . Yeah . "
D,Task,"um which does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Easy finder with the a whistle function or something comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And I think that comm yep comm that's it . "
C,Task,"That's cool . "
A,Task,"So uh comm I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling comm "
D,Elicit,"Okay ? "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"and uh I was just curious to know comm have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? "
A,Minor,"Um comm or if "
A,Elicit,"is that a function we want in the remote ? "
D,Minor,"Um comm I haven't been able to "
C,Elicit,"Um comm do you have trouble whistling ? "
A,Task,"I don't comm but I I know a lot of people do right . "
C,Elicit,"Really ? "
C,Other,"Ooh . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"it just "
A,Task,"I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too comm right ? "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm comm yeah "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I suppose that's true . "
D,Task,"or some sort of voice "
C,Minor,"Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the "
C,Task,"you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just comm you know comm where are you ? . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's costly though . "
A,Task,"Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um comm shouting comm you know comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Sounds good . "
A,Elicit,"uh and then comm what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm something . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Well comm uh let me set this up . "
A,Elicit,"So I plug it in comm press F_ five ? "
A,Elicit,"Function F_ five ? "
C,Task,"Function F_ eight for the um the uh "
A,Other,"Or function F_ eight ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . "
A,Task,"Okay . I think it's uh just to lock it in . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's got it . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys comm "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"um so it's good you went first comm "
A,Task,"and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . "
C,Task,"Let's remember that . "
A,Task,"Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products comm "
A,Task,"and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . "
A,Task,"Um comm a lot of the buttons aren't used comm "
A,Minor,"and uh "
A,Task,"he mentioned that they're not fun to use . "
A,Task,"And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote comm "
A,Task,"there could be a little microphone on it comm "
A,Task,"and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah comm yeah comm that's true . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Well maybe you could have a "
A,Minor,"um hmm "
A,Task,"tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
C,Other,"Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there . "
A,Task,"Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um comm "
A,Task,"and then as for the user interface it should be trendy comm "
A,Task,"um and not computery comm "
A,Task,"right comm so more low tech and not too many buttons . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So I took these all into consideration "
A,Task,"and also I have some limitations from the boss . "
A,Minor,"Right um comm "
A,Task,"and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window . "
A,Task,"And so I did a little research "
A,Task,"and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before comm "
A,Task,"which include comm you know comm um space craft comm coffee makers comm and bullet trains "
C,Task,"Ah is that what that is ? "
A,Task,"Or uh or a high speed train . "
A,Minor,"Right "
A,Task,"and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these . "
C,Task,"Well that's cool . "
C,Other,"If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Right . So comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah sure . "
A,Other,"I figured comm just put 'em all together . "
A,Other,"You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ comm and um "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Other,"as for the user interface problem comm you know comm too many buttons . Give it one button "
A,Other,"and and it's a you know comm for the the cowboy in all of us "
A,Task,"I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but "
C,Task,"Right okay . "
D,Task,"Well I like that design . "
A,Minor,"Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a "
C,Elicit,"Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated comm is it ? "
A,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So I think I I missed the budget thing comm "
A,Elicit,"it was fifty million Euros ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And we gotta sell twenty five of them ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Right . Okay . "
D,Task,"not a problem . "
B,Minor,"Fifty million was uh prof "
C,Task,"Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g "
B,Task,"As a profit . "
A,Task,"Oh okay comm so I I mixed those numbers . "
C,Task,"gotta make profit comm "
C,Task,"so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Well I guess more realistically then comm we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing comm "
A,Task,"cheap plastic uh comm you know comm "
A,Task,"um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"um comm we don't wanna have it "
C,Elicit,"Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? "
C,Elicit,"Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Or a little base station or something comm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm we could do that too . "
A,Task,"Um comm I hadn't thought of that . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That might cost more though comm "
D,Task,"'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide comm well we provide the first batteries comm but it's more comm it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it comm "
D,Task,"A battery in it comm kinda . "
C,Task,"so I don't think it'd up up the price that much . "
A,Minor,"Right comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"so so "
A,Minor,"the unirs the user interface "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons comm "
A,Task,"but since we're a cutting edge company comm we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition comm whistling recognition and rocket power "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"behind our product . "
A,Task,"Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh comm just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um so here's you know comm a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me . "
A,Task,"Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that "
A,Minor,"and um "
A,Task,"you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . "
A,Task,"And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it "
A,Task,"and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so "
A,Task,"uh personal preferences comm I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory comm "
A,Task,"uh non volatile memory comm "
A,Task,"just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm me too . "
A,Task,"Oh okay . "
A,Task,"And the uh comm the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know comm they take more budgeting comm um more technical uh expenditure of effort "
A,Task,"and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's all I got . "
C,Task,"'Kay comm "
C,Other,"thank you very much comm "
C,Other,"um I'll take that back . "
A,Task,"Ooh that's tight . "
C,Task,"Right comm also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting comm "
C,Task,"so didn't manage to forward it on to you comm "
C,Minor,"it is "
C,Other,"let's see comm "
C,Other,"I'll find it myself comm um "
C,Minor,"Ta "
A,Task,"Okay comm I don't think we need to screw it in . "
C,Task,"nah . "
A,Task,"Just push it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated comm and everybody uses the internet anyway . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Um comm dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind . "
C,Task,"Um it's only for the television comm "
C,Task,"which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"and um instead of colours and sorta colour options comm they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . "
D,Other,"Corporate colour . "
C,Task,"Yellow . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yellow . "
C,Task,"I presume . "
C,Task,"Um comm everything comm all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh "
C,Task,"I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor "
C,Task,"I mean comm I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Uh comm where am I ? "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay comm so comm we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have . "
D,Task,"'Kay . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm now comm "
C,Task,"we had as listed options we had "
C,Task,"speech recognition potentially comm "
C,Task,"flat screen interface comm L_C_D_ interface um "
C,Task,"we also want to limit the number of buttons "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"so we'll pretty much take that one as read . "
C,Task,"We'll use the the basic functions for a television . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"No teletext . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"okay hold on . "
D,Task,"Although the the danger with that is comm it could look a bit cheap . "
C,Elicit,"Not enough buttons you mean ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"or it looks like we're just cutting on the um "
D,Task,"On the number of buttons comm kind of functions and stuff . "
C,Task,"I do however have this from over my head comm that they don't want teletext on it . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm comm okay . "
D,Task,"Okay comm cool . "
C,Task,"Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that comm "
C,Task,"or maybe they'll send "
B,Elicit,"About cost . "
C,Task,"some information about that comm "
C,Minor,"about um what people comm "
C,Task,"whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay um . "
C,Elicit,"So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display comm interactive display . "
C,Task,"However that does sound a bit like the "
C,Task,"more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um "
C,Task,"said people didn't like . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Although I guess if there's a sort of "
C,Task,"If you think about standard interfaces that people use already comm sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"I think maybe that's a bit comm going a bit far "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons comm "
C,Task,"and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have "
C,Task,"um it goes to a different selection of buttons comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so it sorta keeps it simple . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Um glow in the dark comm is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Glow in the dark material I was thinking . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Um comm so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think . "
B,Minor,"I "
B,Other,"Uh may I say something about ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh actually I think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market "
B,Task,"because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote comm in the room . "
B,Minor,"But "
D,Other,"Often lost s was that comm "
C,Task,"Lost comm yeah . "
B,Task,"yeah are lost "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark . "
B,Task,"Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control comm "
C,Minor,"That's cool . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
D,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"That's cool . "
B,Task,"and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales comm "
B,Task,"so we should take it into consideration also . "
C,Task,"Okay comm cool . "
C,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Well hmm . "
C,Minor,"speech recognition I take it "
A,Minor,"Oh it's "
C,Minor,"I don't comm I've "
C,Task,"I know of no products um that use speech recognition well . "
A,Minor,"They're act there "
A,Task,"there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . "
A,Task,"You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel . "
C,Elicit,"Really ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . "
A,Task,"Right comm right comm "
A,Task,"and so there was a lot of this comm you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"but if you can work around that that noise problem "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"Well what about "
D,Task,"this might get a bit too expensive actually comm "
D,Task,"but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal "
D,Task,"you know like the ones that we can't hear or something "
C,Task,"Ah comm that's a good idea . "
D,Task,"um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . "
D,Minor,"If you find if y "
A,Task,"Right and then it would do just you know comm uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"What you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker comm "
A,Task,"or not a remo I'm sorry comm "
A,Task,"a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote comm "
A,Task,"'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s . "
D,Task,"Mm . Yeah comm that's the only thing comm yeah . "
A,Task,"But yeah comm then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker "
C,Task,"That we should just stick on comm "
C,Elicit,"yeah . "
D,Elicit,"That comes with our remote control . "
A,Minor,"which "
A,Task,"Right comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap . "
A,Task,"Right comm right . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Right comm right . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Yeah that's certainly possible "
A,Task,"then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . "
A,Task,"If you do have this sorta speech interface to it comm you don't even need to find it . "
A,Task,"You just say you know comm um whatever you whatever you want the remote for comm "
A,Task,"you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off comm "
A,Task,"you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know comm within hearing range . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . "
D,Task,"That could also be built into the T_V_ though comm which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well comm hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve . "
C,Task,"It might do us out of a job . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . "
C,Minor,"Um so I think rather than "
C,Task,"and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"And the expense . "
C,Minor,"so I th "
C,Task,"yeah and expense and the time . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"So I think if we're going to go "
C,Task,"well I mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of "
C,Task,"uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Um comm but I guess not "
C,Task,"I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . "
C,Minor,"Um uh "
C,Elicit,"and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? "
C,Minor,"Is that "
A,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"Maybe not even all of it "
D,Task,"'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important "
D,Task,"so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Contrast contra well . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and then uh if you're comm if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Minor,"So if it's dow it's d uh "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Or if it's down under the couch cushions "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"um which is where I usually find mine . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"Okay comm well we can use "
C,Task,"we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"'cause what I thought comm main "
C,Minor,"um if we're gonna have to "
C,Task,"if we're gonna have the logo on as well comm "
C,Task,"bright yellow logo in our our um "
C,Task,"slogan . "
D,Task,"Slogan comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway comm "
C,Task,"and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well comm of the glow in the dark material comm just as gimmickyness . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"'Cause yeah comm that w more than finding it comm that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark comm you can um still see the remote control . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Alright comm so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback comm sort of remote finder comm then that kinda stuffs that one out then . "
D,Task,"That was more of a a gimmick . "
C,Elicit,"Do you think ? "
D,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm unnecessary . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um comm okay so scratch that . "
C,Minor,"Uh so we've got "
C,Elicit,"do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the is that far too expensive ? "
A,Task,"Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now comm "
A,Minor,"I I think "
C,Task,"Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Well comm I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot comm "
A,Task,"you know they get thrown around comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"They're pretty fragile . "
D,Elicit,"So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ? "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um no comm I mean that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff comm um "
A,Minor,"Yeah mm . "
C,Task,"Uh you were finding out about teletext . "
C,Task,"If you could find out that uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Totally comm it takes cheap speech recognition comm "
B,Minor,"she they wi "
C,Task,"Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a "
A,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"um expensive comm "
D,Elicit,"Yeah you think so ? "
C,Elicit,"no ? "
A,Task,"Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ comm it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . "
C,Task,"Oh right comm okay . "
C,Elicit,"Is it not the circuits that cost "
A,Task,"And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system comm "
A,Minor,"like a "
C,Task,"Oh right comm okay . "
C,Task,"Uh well that kind of takes back the R_F_ the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"Five minutes . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Decisions . "
C,Task,"Uh comm votes comm let's vote . "
C,Elicit,"Who wants T_F_T_ ? "
C,Task,"No-one does . "
C,Task,"Excellent comm "
C,Task,"so we'll go with speech recognition comm yeah ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm comm that's cool . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um comm speech recognition comm limited buttons comm organic design . "
D,Minor,"Um "
C,Elicit,"And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head comm "
C,Task,"programmability . "
B,Elicit,"Glow in dark . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick . "
C,Task,"Uh o okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And also comm integrating the comm remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so . "
C,Task,"Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . "
C,Task,"So comm it just helps me summarize them . "
A,Other,"Yeah yeah . "
B,Other,"Here ? Sure . "
C,Minor,"And um I'll put any "
C,Other,"I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway comm "
C,Minor,"so uh "
D,Other,"And where is it sorry ? "
C,Task,"Uh pro uh project documents . "
C,Minor,"On "
A,Task,"So it should be when you save "
C,Task,"A_M_I_ scenario controller . "
A,Task,"on your desktop comm so it goes save as comm or "
D,Other,"Oh . "
B,Elicit,"Uh it is in shared documents ? "
A,Task,"And then uh hit that little folder up thing again . "
C,Other,"Where am I ? "
B,Elicit,"Projoct uh projector . "
C,Task,"Project documents comm yeah comm it's on your desktop as well . "
A,Task,"Again . "
A,Task,"All the way to the top comm yeah that's up to desktop . "
A,Task,"Right and then project documents . "
D,Task,"Okay comm cool . "
B,Task,"Hmm . It is not giving anything . "
B,Other,"Shared documents . "
C,Minor,"And I will tr "
C,Task,"getting strings of um information comm "
C,Other,"I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular comm "
C,Task,"as soon as I get them now comm rather than "
C,Task,"I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting comm and then the meeting turned up comm so "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"Did you get my email ? "
C,Task,"I did . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Just making sure . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material comm but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material comm "
D,Task,"it's a bit more bouncy comm "
D,Task,"like you said they get chucked around a lot . "
D,Task,"Um comm a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The rubber rather than "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"More sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Wow . "
B,Minor,"Um but we have to take care like "
B,Task,"But we have to take care of our children also "
B,Minor,"if they "
B,Task,"means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful . "
B,Task,"So comm whatever material we use it should be yeah . "
C,Other,"Oh no comm ethics comm that's gonna cost us money . "
B,Task,"So we have to safety point of view also comm we have to take care . "
C,Task,"Okay comm safety . "
D,Task,"Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that comm so that's something good comm um "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I dunno comm I mean "
C,Minor,"It sme "
A,Minor,"We could go comp yeah . "
C,Other,"smells good for children . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . "
A,Task,"And it's got the thing on the inside . "
A,Task,"And there's no buttons at all comm "
A,Task,"it's always on comm and just yell at it comm and it works . "
D,Task,"That's a good idea . "
C,Minor,"That sounds comm "
A,Task,"And then ch children will love it . "
C,Task,"yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball comm yeah comm sorry . "
D,Task,"Interesting . "
A,Task,"Oh yellow comm yellow ball . Right . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah comm d with the colour comm um does it have to be all yellow comm do you know ? "
C,Task,"Please God no . "
C,Minor,"Um . Well comm I wouldn't th I mean comm "
D,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror comm so "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think just having it "
B,Task,"Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it . "
D,Task,"Having a little bit . "
C,Task,"surrounding the logo . "
D,Task,"Okay cool . "
D,Minor,"Mm mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm comm okay . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
C,Other,"And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the "
C,Elicit,"what was it ? "
C,Task,"We put we put fashion into "
C,Other,"Whoops comm "
C,Task,"it's not working . "
C,Task,"Can't believe I've forgotten it . "
C,Task,"We put the fashion in electronics "
D,Other,"Oh yeah comm that's a good one that . "
C,Other,". I bet that'll catch on well . "
D,Minor,"Yeah so . "
C,Elicit,"Okay comm any last "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"worries comm queries ? "
A,Task,"Twelve thirty . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"S s "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"I know what you're thinking . "
C,Task,"Okay then comm lunchtime comm "
C,Task,"yay . "
B,Task,"That's good . "
C,Task,"Okay comm that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one . "
C,Task,"This is quite fun actually . "
D,Other,"Wow . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Has anybo oh . "
C,Minor,"I really don't "
D,Elicit,"Has anybody pressed okay comm "
D,Task,"it vibrates . "
D,Task,"It's pretty cool . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Check here . "
C,Task,"Wow you've your first page . "
C,Task,"I was just writing really big . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm got small writing . "
A,Task,"Yeah I've been using up the pages . "
D,Task,"I don't wanna waste it . "
C,Task,"I've finished the meeting now . "
C,Task,"Oh comm everybody needs k questionnaire . "
A,Task,"Another questionnaire . "
