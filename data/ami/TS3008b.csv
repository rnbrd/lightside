B,Other,"Here we go again . "
C,Task,"My mouse is not working anymore . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Minor,"He's uh "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"when I put it in comm is is going to beep beep beep . "
D,Task,"Oh comm I got a nice little screen here over here . "
D,Task,"I got like this big black border uh on every side . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Mm comm okay . "
A,Elicit,"Everybody ready ? "
D,Other,"I'll I'll fix it . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm whatever . "
A,Task,"Welcome at the functional design meeting comm again presented by Maarten . "
A,Task,"Uh this is the agenda comm the opening . "
A,Task,"Uh comm we've got three presentations . "
A,Other,"And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . "
A,Task,"And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions . "
A,Task,"We have uh forty minutes . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Oh comm well this is the the closing already . "
A,Task,"So uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then . "
A,Task,"Uh comm I think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Maybe the "
D,Task,"I don't know what the right order is . So "
A,Minor,"Well comm it "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Minor,"Oh that . It won't doesn't "
A,Task,"Maybe we should start with the the technical functions . "
C,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Elicit,"how can I get this on the whiteboard ? "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder . "
B,Task,"In project . "
C,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"I've done that . "
A,Elicit,"You've already done that ? "
B,Task,"No can that open . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Well let's close this one . "
A,Task,"We'll just uh open a new one . "
B,Task,"Open it there . "
A,Other,"Uh comm well . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Uh-oh . New thing . "
A,Other,"Oh yeah comm uh I have to say something . "
A,Task,"Uh comm due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . "
A,Other,"But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"About the get "
A,Other,"And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too . "
C,Task,"'Kay comm we're going to um uh talk about working design . "
C,Task,"Um comm the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy comm "
C,Task,"it activates a chip uh in the remote . "
C,Task,"It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . "
C,Task,"Mm comm it's a nowadays very uh known comm a known uh uh technology . "
C,Task,"Um comm the known technology can make a cost very low . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm it's a wild uh "
C,Task,"a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . "
C,Task,"And and the components are very uh very cheap . "
C,Minor,"Um comm "
C,Task,"Uh comm diodes comm uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights comm they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . "
C,Task,"Uh comm again comm it's a fair price . "
C,Task,"It's a common uh technology uh comm like I told um "
C,Task,"Uh comm the circuit board comm it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . "
C,Task,"Uh comm we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires comm "
C,Minor,"it's it is uh "
C,Task,"can be made as fast as printing paper . "
C,Minor,"It's uh it's all very uh "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm they're making it uh all the time . Uh comm "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"and it's not uh very specialised uh technology . "
C,Task,"I haven't come to here comm but um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . "
C,Task,"They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows . "
C,Task,"So I don't know uh why I should put it here . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Okay . But it's the technical side of the remote control . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Task,"but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time . "
A,Task,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Okay . Well comm we'll we'll have to skip that part then . "
C,Minor,"What ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"It's gonna be easy ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"But nothing restricted for user interface ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . M "
B,Elicit,"With technical "
C,Task,"Um comm no comm it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology comm yeah . "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"Remote control is nothing special nowadays . "
A,Elicit,"R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . Doesn't really matter . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"But I kind of uh "
C,Task,"I don't think so comm "
A,Task,"Okay . Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions comm "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ? "
A,Task,"Well comm we'll see . We'll see later on . "
B,Task,"Well comm the technical functions . "
B,Elicit,"Um comm well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got comm "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"but uh I got these two comm "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"and I think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . "
B,Task,"th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements comm "
B,Elicit,"I don't s uh know who's doing t "
A,Task,"Well comm uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but it I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control . "
A,Task,"The ones I I've uh received from the account manager . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well comm we'll keep this in mind comm and then discuss it later on . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah comm when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . "
A,Task,"we should we should choose one uh "
A,Task,"we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v "
D,Task,"Yes comm I agree . Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Elicit,"Well comm what that's what you want trying to say . "
B,Task,"Well comm yeah "
B,Task,"w if you want try a a a huge market comm if you want to reach a huge market comm uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But I don't know . "
B,Task,"It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm well some of these "
A,Task,"Uh comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well comm some of that will "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm probably comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Other,"So "
B,Task,"Uh well comm there are l at least uh basic functions comm "
B,Task,"uh like just th the channels uh one till nine comm "
B,Task,"uh on and off switch comm which must be clear with a red button or something like that . "
B,Task,"Um comm most standard uh have volume comm of course comm and a mute function comm and comm of course comm the next and previous channel . "
B,Task,"I think that's just basic what we need . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And from that on we can user requirements what we need more . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets comm "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Elicit,"and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions comm more buttons comm maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that . "
B,Minor,"M you can just you can k "
D,Task,"I haven't really found a conclusion like that . "
B,Task,"you can keep it in mind that . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"Uh comm I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh "
D,Task,"Design . "
B,Task,"yeah comm more trendier design comm I think . I think . "
D,Task,"Sounds interesting . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"Uh comm well comm that's all I have to say comm I think . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that was it . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Well comm then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market . "
D,Other,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yeah . It's alright . "
B,Minor,". "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Alright comm I've done some research for functional requirements . "
D,Minor,"Um yes . "
D,Task,"The working method um "
D,Task,"there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people comm uh how do you say uh comm f watched using remote controls in the usability lab "
D,Task,"and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . "
D,Task,"Uh comm I've lined them up here . "
D,Task,"Uh comm ask whether um common remote control looks good or not comm "
D,Task,"about willingness to spend money on remote control comm "
D,Task,"about zapping behaviour comm and uh and stuff like that . "
D,Task,"I uh have found some interesting things . "
D,Task,"We do we do got a market . "
D,Minor,"Um comm "
D,Task,"three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . "
D,Task,"So if we make a trendy design comm we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market comm which you can reach . "
D,Task,"Um comm three out of four users uh zaps a lot comm as I uh quoted here from the uh results . "
D,Task,"Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . "
D,Task,"That's quite a lot . "
D,Minor,"Um comm "
D,Task,"relevant options are comm of course comm power buttons . Although comm only used once per hour . "
D,Task,"Uh comm channel selection comm volume and buttons for text comm "
D,Minor,"and the more um comm yeah comm "
D,Task,"other functions comm like audio settings comm video settings comm sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . "
D,Task,"Furthermore comm fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . "
D,Task,"That doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . "
D,Task,"Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . "
D,Task,"And um an important thing here comm "
D,Task,"the most important customers uh comm which is over seventy percent of our market comm is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . "
D,Task,"And uh elderly people comm our market comm are less interested in uh nice features comm but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . "
D,Task,"So comm what I was thinking "
D,Task,"oh comm wrong side . "
D,Task,"We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control comm because elderly people will get th lost . "
D,Task,"Group features for a higher usability comm "
D,Task,"uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . "
D,Task,"Um comm all the settings comm about audio settings comm video settings and channel settings comm which are not very often used comm we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever comm "
D,Task,"because they are used very rarely and well comm "
D,Task,"it uh there are a lot of options there comm so we can really make uh yeah comm how do you say comm we can spare at buttons over there . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And um comm if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options comm group them in the button comm "
D,Minor,"not too uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Small buttons comm so they won't be very um comm "
D,Elicit,"how do you say "
A,Task,"Visually presents . "
D,Task,"Yes comm won't be very present comm "
D,Other,"thank you . "
D,Task,"And a trendy look comm well uh comm although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever comm I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . "
D,Task,"That was kind of what I found . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Well comm then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements "
A,Task,"and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Uh comm well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant comm I think . "
A,Task,"Because um uh s decided to put They have decide to put two additional requirements forward . "
A,Task,"Well comm now I see four . "
D,Elicit,"Two ? "
A,Task,"That's kinda strange . "
A,Task,"Well comm they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . "
A,Task,"Well comm I think that may be so comm but well comm we can't just leave the teletext button off . "
B,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"No uh comm I agree comm I agree . "
A,Task,"It's impossible comm I think . "
B,Task,"No way . "
A,Task,"So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button comm you know comm like on and off comm "
A,Task,"and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or "
D,Task,"Not too much comm no . "
A,Task,"You know comm it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext comm but not to play with it that much . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So we have to think of that . "
A,Task,"The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise comm the project becomes more complex comm which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . "
A,Task,"So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"I think that uh that's what they're trying to say . "
A,Task,"Uh comm our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . "
A,Task,"New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . "
A,Task,"So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"But comm well comm they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger "
D,Task,"I don't really agree actually comm to be honest . "
D,Task,"It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . "
D,Task,"It's only like thirty percent of the total market . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about comm we already cover that . "
D,Minor,"Mayb "
D,Elicit,"yeah ? "
A,Task,"Our company already sells remote control to the older people comm but we we also want comm you know comm a new customer group . "
A,Task,"That's the one we haven't covered yet . "
A,Task,"So I think that's what the problem is . "
A,Minor,"We haven't got remote controls for uh "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Well I think comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
A,Minor,"Maybe if it's "
D,Task,"Not too much then comm bu alright . "
A,Task,"no no comm but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . "
A,Task,"So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group comm but isn't that bad for an older person either . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Uh comm our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . "
A,Task,"Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . "
A,Task,"Okay comm something else nice to know . "
B,Elicit,"But what's our slogan ? "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
A,Other,"Yeah comm you will have to look that up . "
B,Elicit,"The slogan uh "
D,Other,"Yeah comm I'll have a look . "
D,Task,"We put the fashion in electronics . "
A,Minor,"I think it's something about the "
B,Task,"Puts fashion in electronics . "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Task,"I thought it w might be comm let's make things better or something comm but "
D,Task,"Sense and simplicity . "
B,Task,"Sense simplicity . "
A,Minor,"Okay well comm "
A,Task,"let's go back to the the agenda . "
A,Task,"So we've now had to the three presentations . "
A,Task,"We know about the new project requirements . "
A,Task,"That means we can uh well d yeah comm discuss on the remote control functions . "
A,Other,"Well comm if I can uh make a start comm "
A,Task,"I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be comm "
A,Task,"and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . "
A,Minor,"I think we're we're looking for some "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . "
A,Minor,"Y well comm that "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Well comm to be honest comm if um our uh aim group is uh till forty comm not older than forty comm maybe that's not very uh yeah comm we don't really need to have a simple remote control . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think we can implement more functions then comm "
D,Task,"because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but wha "
D,Minor,"and therefore will be a more "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"M yeah comm that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me comm I think they are are c are contradicting each other comm "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"because they want a simpler design comm and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ comm but they s do aim at a younger "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used . "
A,Minor,"Well comm ma "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"So why should j we put this function in ? "
D,Minor,"Well comm I think "
B,Minor,"I think more "
B,Task,"I think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions . "
A,Task,"But I think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the comm know comm th th in functions you have "
A,Minor,"Y "
A,Task,"Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room comm like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"You can uh comm know comm you "
A,Task,"you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the comm you know comm audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . "
A,Task,"We don't want that . "
A,Task,"I think that was that became clear . "
A,Task,"We don't want . "
A,Minor,"But w maybe we should put some func uh comm "
A,Task,"I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to comm "
A,Task,"you know comm they want to uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm control . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but uh you said "
A,Task,"control comm remotely . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm d yeah comm but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making . "
A,Task,"No comm yeah comm th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to "
B,Minor,"It's n "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But maybe w Yeah . I think we maybe should "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it . "
A,Task,"But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind comm "
A,Elicit,"or n what d what do you guys think ? "
C,Task,"But you can put them under the same button . "
D,Task,"Not much more than that . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm if as far as possible . "
D,Task,"Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever . "
D,Minor,"So t "
A,Elicit,"But what do you think ? "
A,Elicit,"Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices ? "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"No comm you don't think so ? "
B,Task,"No comm new requirements say no . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm the new requirements say so . "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"But you can put a play and stop and and rewind . "
A,Minor,"Well comm maybe it's "
A,Task,"maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but "
A,Task,"You know comm a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with "
C,Minor,"Yes comm but we "
D,Minor,"Y yes . "
B,Task,"I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control comm they use their own th th with lot more functions . "
A,Task,"Yep comm exactly . "
A,Minor,"That's that's wha "
D,Task,"But but for for example comm V_C_R_ comm that's better example in this case . "
D,Task,"I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever comm "
A,Task,"No no comm you don't No no comm you don't need it . No comm no . "
B,Task,"No comm no . Exactly . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
D,Task,"just play comm stop comm rewind and uh fast forward . "
A,Task,"Okay comm but we have to think uh w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh comm I guess comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I know comm "
D,Minor,"but uh "
A,Task,"so um but uh from my experience it's kinda a lot of D_V_D_ players comm you know comm like forwarding comm goes differently . "
A,Task,"Uh comm you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . "
B,Minor,"Mm comm yeah . "
A,Task,"It's c sometimes a bit difficult . "
A,Task,"Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh "
A,Task,"Well comm I was thinking about putting it in comm but concerning the project requirements and what you just said comm I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but just "
B,Task,"keep it simple "
B,Minor,"and look more at th "
A,Task,"And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . "
A,Task,"If you want to keep it simple comm you can make a universal remote . "
B,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"It's only for television . So "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yes comm but there are there are "
A,Task,"It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table comm "
A,Task,"and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch comm you pick up the the the nice remote comm the simple one comm just to put on the television comm nothing more . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm nothing more . Exactly . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"Um comm but what televis "
C,Elicit,"But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? "
C,Task,"There are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we we'll make w this one trendy . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And simple . "
B,Task,"The user interface is easy . "
A,Task,"Well comm we we will come to that comm "
A,Task,"but ju first on the on the functions . "
A,Task,"So we should put uh zap buttons on it . "
A,Task,"Um comm also numbers comm to uh to go to the specific channels . "
B,Minor,"And the basic "
B,Task,"yeah comm basic functions comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yes comm definitely comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm "
B,Task,"It's too much integrated in the other . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"a t a teletext button should be there . "
A,Task,"But just one big teletext button comm on and off . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Probably . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"and maybe two or three other options comm but not nothing more than that . "
D,Task,"I think stop function is very useful . "
D,Task,"If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages comm and you are not a very quick reader comm "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
D,Task,"then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up comm but "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but uh I think that becomes too difficult comm "
A,Task,"it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then . "
D,Task,"Well comm I use it very regularly comm the action . I re I use it quite often . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm but maybe you s yeah yeah comm maybe y you do comm but I've never heard of it in the first place . And "
B,Minor,"Will you look "
A,Task,"we have to "
A,Task,"well t yeah comm and t and teletext is becoming outdated . "
B,Task,"Look at the market . "
A,Task,"We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . "
A,Task,"Yeah . I don't know . "
A,Task,"I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote . "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Elicit,"I don't know what you th guys think . "
D,Task,"Might be . Might be . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm I uh comm it's "
B,Task,"Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah comm for the soccer uh "
A,Elicit,"Yeah comm but do you like to have a such a s stop button ? "
A,Minor,"Or do you think it uh "
A,Task,"I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function . "
B,Minor,"Well comm uh when you uh uh when you look uh "
B,Task,"for example um comm a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights comm and there are a lot of flights in one page comm so if if th "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm it goes "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . "
A,Task,"That's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements . "
C,Minor,"Yes comm but you could put "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but "
C,Task,"on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . "
C,Task,"If you have seven pages comm you can go up and down . "
A,Task,"Well yeah uh comm "
A,Task,"lots of new televisions can store pages comm you know comm and then you can just skip manually through them using "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"True . "
A,Task,"I think we should just put one teletext button on it . "
A,Task,"Then we meet uh the new requirements . "
A,Minor,"we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re "
A,Task,"we have to choose for the the simple design comm I guess . "
B,Task,"A simple yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um comm "
A,Elicit,"well comm what functions do we have to decide on ? "
A,Minor,"Or do we "
A,Task,"uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . "
A,Task,"We have the zap and uh the volume . "
A,Task,"Should we do m make them very big ? The the the zap button . "
A,Minor,"D d "
D,Task,"I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present comm "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also . "
B,Task,"But trendy comm yeah . "
D,Task,"yep . "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"Or maybe you should place them on a uh comm in a special way ? "
C,Task,"Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm something "
A,Task,"or uh somethin special way to to zap through the "
A,Task,"it has to s it has to be "
A,Task,"yeah comm and quick . You have to use it very quickly . "
B,Task,"Original . "
B,Minor,"It was uh "
D,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"True . "
D,Task,"If you grab the remote comm your hands should be on top of the plus . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Other,"Oh comm what should we decide on then ? "
A,Task,"I think in a in a case of this simple remote control comm the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already comm but it w shouldn't be a problem then . "
C,Minor,"But "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"No comm it's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Maybe uh "
A,Task,"No comm okay comm but we don't have to uh comm when we don't want to uh control other devices comm I think it makes it even more simple . "
C,Minor,"No . "
B,Minor,"Uh maybe we "
B,Elicit,"uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries . "
C,Task,"The most standard batteries . "
A,Minor,"I think "
A,Minor,"I think that we should use uh d "
D,Task,"I think double A_ . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"yeah comm not not uh the b the watch kind "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"th the most uh "
A,Task,"Well comm it has to be simple comm and I wi "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The most ordinary uh batteries . "
A,Task,"Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house comm you know . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Elicit,"Oh . How much time do we ha we have left uh ? "
A,Elicit,"M m m more than thirty minutes ? "
D,Task,"I think about twenty minutes . "
A,Task,"Uh ten twenty minutes . "
C,Task,"But i in a way we have to be uh uh special . "
A,Minor,"Well comm uh these these shouldn't "
B,Task,"Early break . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"But that's that's "
A,Elicit,"Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can what the extra touch can be . "
C,Minor,"Maybe th m "
A,Elicit,"Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or "
A,Task,"Well comm it was something about how we lose them . "
A,Task,"Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing . "
D,Task,"I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever . "
B,Task,"To find him . That's maybe yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I don't know . I don't know . "
A,Task,"Nah comm um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . "
A,Task,"It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone comm and it is i has something nice . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm that's good one comm yep . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it comm "
A,Minor,"or maybe it should or an "
A,Task,"or the like the the can opener . Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control . "
A,Task,"I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control comm we have to do something to make it special . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's gonna cost twenty five Euros . "
D,Task,"Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually comm because television and beer is not a rare combination . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but the well comm it's already been done . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but that's "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Nah . Yeah comm that's true . "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"and I think it's gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something comm "
A,Task,"so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"it has to be used something special comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"and you really it has to comm "
A,Task,"you know y not s people comm when they buy it comm they have to think comm well this one lasts for a long time . We're really gonna use them . "
A,Task,"Not some thing you you throw away next week comm you know . "
D,Task,"No comm that's true . "
A,Task,"So maybe uh that's i I think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions comm know comm basic functions comm uh it's very important to find something like this . "
A,Task,"So there's a very important task for you . "
A,Task,"And maybe we can all think about it . "
B,Task,"Be original comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh comm also for you maybe comm when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy comm and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well comm you know . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And use friendly comm yeah . "
A,Task,"So big buttons comm flashy design comm and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Must brain-storm . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"a swapable front or whatever . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm or just different colours would be uh I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . "
B,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"For the remote control . "
A,Minor,"It could be be "
A,Task,"Yeah comm you never know comm but "
B,Task,"Why not ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"More money for us . "
A,Minor,"But it "
A,Task,"and I think we have to make it quite big . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Quite big . Yeah comm you think ? "
D,Task,"Yes comm definitely comm definitely . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"That's to be uh a formed for your hand . "
A,Minor,"people "
A,Task,"So comm and and also because uh it is expensive . "
A,Task,"If you want it to be something comm you know comm it's ha doesn't have much functions "
A,Minor,"want to be you don't want to get it l make it "
D,Task,"Yes comm it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room . "
D,Minor,"As I uh as I said during my presentation comm fifty percent uh o "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . "
A,Task,"I I think you m might wanna put it uh "
B,Task,"A standard or something . "
A,Task,"yeah comm that it it it it stands up . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . "
D,Other,"A face ? "
D,Task,"Or uh yeah comm yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"no no comm put stuff inside it . But comm it's like like a statue or something "
C,Task,"More like a joystick then . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm I see what you mean comm yep . "
B,Task,"It's like you have uh four phones . Something like that . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah comm but yeah comm but you also can put it somewhere near the window in "
D,Task,"If you do that comm but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . "
A,Task,"That it's it's fashionable . "
A,Minor,"I I don't "
D,Task,"I in in the base we could like make uh a button comm and if you push it comm the remote control itself s makes noise . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm yeah . "
D,Task,"That's probably stupid comm "
D,Task,"but uh as I found here uh comm fifty percent comm "
D,Other,"was it fifty ? "
C,Task,"But that's that's fun for the first time comm and then the second "
D,Minor,"Uh fifty percent "
D,Task,"fifty percent often loses remote control . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but but when you when it gets lost comm how can you press the button to make it "
D,Task,"No uh comm of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in . "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
B,Task,"On the television . "
B,Task,"Oh comm like this . "
A,Task,"Uh comm that's kind of nice . "
D,Task,"If an a button in in that uh "
C,Minor,"Or you can "
A,Task,"And then also you don't even need batteries comm because you can make it uh chargeable . "
B,Task,"A char chargeable . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you can ma make rechargeable one comm yeah . Why not . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm that w yeah comm but yeah comm the pro No comm well I think that it might be t p Well comm nee but we don't Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Why not . "
A,Task,"Maybe you comm but we don't know much about production cost comm "
A,Task,"but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control comm then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know comm rechargeable units . "
C,Task,"With recharger . "
D,Task,"It should only cost twelve and a half Euros comm of course . Aye ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So comm it's not gonna be that expen "
B,Minor,"Production . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"It should be possible . "
A,Task,"Uh I I think it's a great idea . "
B,Task,"I think it's a good idea . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"S some kind of be "
B,Elicit,"To make a base or something ? "
A,Task,"I've never seen that before comm and you make it uh um be uh comm you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays . "
D,Task,"Yes . Yes comm definitely . Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Yes comm but is that handy ? "
A,Task,"Well comm I well it's really ch you can recharge it comm so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one . "
B,Minor,"It's it's it's it's "
A,Task,"And uh you can always find your remote control up "
C,Task,"But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years comm three years comm with with t two batteries . "
B,Task,"it's not the purpose to be handy comm it's "
A,Task,"Uh comm okay . "
A,Task,"Well comm maybe yeah comm you could when that's when it's too costly comm you could probably skip the recharger comm "
C,Minor,"And then you "
A,Minor,"but you will you do need uh also an "
A,Task,"uh comm also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well comm you know . "
A,Minor,"Does it makes it kinda "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts comm of course . "
C,Minor,"Or "
B,Task,"Mm . Yeah comm but that's not it's ugly comm I think . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . Okay . Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it . "
B,Minor,"No . "
D,Task,"On the other hand comm if you don't do it comm we can also make a nice bay . "
D,Task,"I mean comm it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it comm "
D,Task,"but um I think the bay is definitely uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it's a good idea . "
A,Minor,"And make it comm you know comm we we um "
A,Minor,"Well comm we uh it's "
A,Task,"it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . "
A,Task,"We can save on the on the functions . "
A,Task,"We just put some simple button in comm "
A,Task,"make it big and sturdy comm nothing more comm "
A,Task,"and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make comm "
A,Task,"or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up comm "
D,Task,"Sure comm why not . Yep . "
A,Task,"it's also nice . "
A,Minor,"And if you put it away comm I think it's uh w we have to we uh that's uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"it's not a easy market . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We have to something special . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control comm "
B,Minor,"True . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions comm "
D,Task,"Definitely . "
A,Minor,"because we aren't gonna put "
D,Task,"With eye candy comm ear candy comm whatever . Yeah comm definitely . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And then uh when make it comm you know comm nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing . "
A,Task,"Yeah . I think I think it's a good idea . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it must be must be a gadget to have . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Definitely comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm if it let's "
A,Task,"well comm we will see what's possible concerning the the costs comm and if it's possible we'll do that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . "
A,Task,"And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . "
A,Task,"If that's too expensive comm we won't do that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm we c "
A,Task,"But it would be nice . "
D,Task,"It would be nice comm yes . "
A,Task,"It's the idea . "
A,Task,"I know that batteries last long nowadays . "
A,Task,"And and what people just think about comm well comm I'll never have to buy any r batteries again comm so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . "
A,Task,"And you know then when you haven't batteries around comm and probably for two weeks comm your remo I've experienced that that "
D,Task,"Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty comm so yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"So comm easy functions . Well comm we will we will I think we'll work that out comm "
A,Task,"zapping comm numbers on it comm bi "
B,Task,"Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm why not . "
A,Task,"Yeah . But it's also annoying . "
A,Task,"'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working comm you're not very motivated to do something about it . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"true . "
A,Task,"Then it beeps all the time and . "
D,Task,"No comm that's true . "
A,Task,"You don't want to have ever have those problems comm and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable . "
A,Task,"And you don't have to use the unit comm you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm i i in the in the ma "
D,Task,"Why not . "
C,Task,"But you pay for it . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but it w I mean comm if if they pay for it because they think comm oh comm that's a great idea comm I'm gonna use it . "
A,Task,"And when it comm you know comm when time goes by and they think comm well comm I'll never put him in the recharger comm I think last long enough comm then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . "
A,Minor,"Then when they look get m I I "
A,Task,"I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control comm within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control comm they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it's brilliant . "
D,Task,"Bleep bleep bleep comm oh there it is comm yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I've never it's so simple comm but I've never seen it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"No . Nearly . "
B,Task,"And you can leave it just there . "
A,Task,"M maybe we should really do this . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Okay now comm well comm how much time have we got left ? "
A,Task,"These clocks aren't uh synched . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm now I've put uh well comm "
A,Minor,"it is twenty p "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm I'll "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm so we have ten minutes or something ? "
D,Task,"Something like that comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but we're uh we're done . I think . "
B,Task,"Uh fifteen minutes . "
A,Task,"We've decided on the functions . "
A,Minor,"Well comm there is some oh . "
A,Task,"There is a closing sheet . "
A,Task,"We have lunch break comm and then we have thirty minutes of individual work . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Oh okay comm I'll make sure I'll "
A,Task,"I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes comm "
A,Task,"the the s the next minutes won't be a problem comm "
A,Other,"but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too comm "
A,Task,"but maybe it won't work comm but you'll see . "
A,Task,"I think these are more important than the first ones comm so "
D,Minor,"We'll see . "
B,Task,"Can you make an uh uh a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ? "
B,Task,"That not not everything in one one uh folder . "
A,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Maarten comm five minutes . "
A,Task,"Oh comm five minutes . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm because uh I I d I did uh the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy comm you know . "
A,Task,"Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout comm which I could uh comm know comm use for the other ones well comm "
A,Task,"but uh I d think uh I forgot to do put done under the first one comm "
A,Task,"and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Maybe . "
D,Elicit,"No comm that's true uh comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"And then you "
A,Task,"you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . "
A,Task,"Becau I d uh comm it was not my uh pen . "
D,Other,"Should we by the way draw um "
A,Task,"this kind of looks you like . "
D,Other,"on our nice whiteboard comm um a little uh idea of "
A,Elicit,"Of the shape . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Or the sh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm probably comm it would be nice . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
D,Elicit,"Has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? "
B,Elicit,"Do you get an idea of the shape ? "
D,Task,"I don't comm for one . "
C,Task,"Maybe like this pen . "
D,Task,"A bit bigger I guess comm but "
A,Task,"No comm bigger . "
B,Task,"A little bit bigger comm yeah but "
D,Task,"The shape is nice comm "
D,Task,"it's um something different comm and we want we want that . "
C,Task,"It has to feel nice in your hand . "
A,Task,"Well comm I I I have to say comm I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"or I think some maybe we should "
A,Task,"no comm that will be too costly . "
B,Task,"Oh comm uh look uh look at the pictures . "
A,Minor,"We shou we could also comm "
A,Task,"that was a would also be an idea comm "
A,Task,"but I don't think it I don't know if it exists already comm "
A,Task,"you should like make Alessi or something design it . "
D,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
A,Task,"That would also be nice . "
A,Minor,"But that's gonna then you c then you don't "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but twelve and a half Euros ? Uh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but then you don't have t yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time comm you know s was it's a single cost . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm m but but then you can "
A,Minor,"nah comm I don't thin "
A,Task,"I think that it would be more expensive comm "
A,Task,"because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
A,Task,"Would be a nice idea though . "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"I think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something . "
A,Task,"Like something like that or so or so "
D,Task,"Something like that is very ergonomic . "
A,Task,"And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Put it in there uh wire on it . "
A,Task,"Maybe uh comm I don't know comm some some lights comm a big but well . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm flash lights at the side . At the side comm or something like that . "
A,Task,"Volume and programme comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yes comm volume and programme should be there I guess comm because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part . "
A,Minor,"And some of the extra funct "
A,Task,"Some of the extra functions over here . Numbers . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"and the numbers on top comm I guess . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And and lights ? "
A,Task,"How we're g well comm maybe uh s a ring of "
A,Task,"no comm no comm you have to "
A,Task,"Maybe on the side of it . "
D,Minor,"Maybe ro roun rounds "
D,Other,"uh uh l sorry . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm side of it . "
A,Task,"Along the side uh strip of yeah . "
B,Task,"Just two LEDs or something on the side . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but I also meant the the blinking li w you know comm the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well comm theys have to be "
B,Task,"Well comm uh probably at the side . "
B,Task,"You know look at the front comm but "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm yeah . Exactly . "
A,Task,"When you you see it from the side comm then it would look just like that . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm exactly comm "
A,Task,"And then you have a strip of uh lights or something "
B,Minor,"and then there is yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm something like that comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Well comm uh I think it's nice comm for one thing . "
A,Task,"maybe put something on top of it or comm you know comm like that's looks funny . "
B,Task,"No . No . "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"Or some bump . "
D,Task,"I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then . "
A,Minor,"Maybe some "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"Bumper or something . "
A,Task,"We'll have to think about it . "
A,Task,"I think we're we're done . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yes comm we are . "
A,Task,"We can save this one . "
B,Task,"Lunch break . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
D,Task,"Yes comm I guess it's lunch time . "
B,Task,"Okay then . "
A,Minor,"Mm mm . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Elicit,"Half and hour ? "
D,Task,"I thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour . "
B,Task,"Okay comm five uh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that was what uh "
D,Task,"I don't know about the lunch break . "
A,Task,"Mm comm we'll hear about it . "
D,Minor,"Well "
B,Other,"Oh . "
B,Minor,". "
