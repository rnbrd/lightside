Speaker,DialogAct,Text
A,Task,"So we come again for the the second meeting . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one . "
A,Task,"And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And we have think I got a new project requirement . "
A,Task,"So I think uh teletext becomes outdated . "
A,Task,"So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"and I think we don't need lighting adaptive comm "
A,Task,"so the remote control should be only used for the the television . "
A,Task,"And of course we should have our image in the in the design . "
A,Task,"So comm let's start with the the industrial designer . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm alright . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"So uh "
A,Task,"Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want . "
C,Task,"Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder "
A,Other,"Here . "
C,Task,"so I I I think you can reach it from here . "
D,Task,"Just go to explorer . "
D,Task,"Or open . "
A,Minor,"Oh okay . "
D,Task,"Participant two . "
C,Task,"Participant two . "
A,Elicit,"This one . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Open uh . "
C,Task,"Uh open . "
A,Other,"Do you want to open "
B,Other,"Because it's open you mean . "
C,Task,"Right comm so um I will talk about the the w working design and "
B,Task,"F_ five . "
D,Task,"Slide show comm view slide show comm . "
A,Minor,"Ah . "
C,Task,"And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . "
C,Task,"So uh can you go one page down comm please . "
C,Task,"So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . "
C,Minor,"So uh mm I'm thin uh "
C,Other,"I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market "
C,Other,"and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . "
C,Other,"Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype "
C,Other,"and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like . "
C,Other,"And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . "
C,Task,"And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . "
C,Task,"Okay so can you go down uh "
C,Task,"So comm wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired "
C,Task,"so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the . "
C,Task,"Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . "
C,Task,"And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication "
C,Task,"So uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls "
B,Elicit,"Did you draw it ? "
A,Task,"Wow . "
C,Task,"so uh you can you can see the components comm uh battery "
C,Task,"and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set . "
B,Minor,"This . "
A,Minor,"This "
B,Elicit,"What is the other chip for ? The one on top . "
C,Task,"The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities "
D,Task,"One is a communication . "
C,Task,"and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well comm putting things together comm "
C,Task,"um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T_V_ set . "
B,Minor,"For men . "
B,Minor,"To the in "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And comm that's it . "
C,Task,"I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"What is F_P_G_A_ ? "
C,Task,"It's field programmable uh something array . "
D,Task,"Gateway arrays . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It's a field programmable gateway arrays . "
B,Elicit,"So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ? "
C,Task,"Well comm uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Programme it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
B,Elicit,"So this are the they have to work together ? "
B,Elicit,"Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice "
C,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Well comm th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? "
D,Task,"And the second one is for the software . "
B,Minor,"Is the is the software par "
D,Task,"Yeah to run th to make it run . "
B,Other,"alri okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"That's it . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm okay . "
B,Other,"So you can control if you want comm right ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"Alright and that's it for the working design . "
C,Elicit,"So if you have any questions ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"Okay comm and how about the battery power ? "
D,Elicit,"Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? "
C,Task,"Uh no no no no comm "
C,Task,"I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the "
A,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Into the "
C,Task,"yeah into the t . "
D,Minor,"more compact and uh okay comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"And uh I I don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run comm so "
B,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . Okay . "
B,Task,"Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's a good idea . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"We just make a small charger "
B,Minor,"Uh mm . "
B,Minor,"Y yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"and put it "
B,Task,"Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth comm if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to comm right ? "
C,Task,"That's a good idea . "
A,Minor,"You can i yeah . "
A,Minor,"Ma "
C,Task,"Also comm but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control . "
D,Minor,"Bu "
B,Other,"I dunno . "
A,Minor,"Yeah we can change the b . "
D,Task,"Our remote comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . "
C,Other,"S okay comm so charger for is the . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"So is mine . "
A,Task,"It's mine . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Elicit,"Participant one comm no ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm this your "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Oh we have "
A,Task,"so let's move to to user interface design . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So you can open uh "
A,Elicit,"Participant "
B,Task,"three . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"So I'm working on the technical functions design . "
B,Task,"can you show the next slide . "
B,Task,"So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . "
B,Task,"So so I found on a webs on the internet "
A,Other,"During the weekend . "
B,Other,"yeah . "
B,Task,"I spent a lot of time searching "
A,Task,"That's good . "
B,Task,"and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"G "
B,Task,"For example switch on comm switch off comm switch the next channel and so on and so on . "
B,Task,"So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors "
B,Task,"so can you "
A,Elicit,"This are usual functionality . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Ours is a bit uh different . "
B,Task,"So these are two example . "
B,Task,"One is from "
B,Task,"the other one is from comm yeah comm uh engineering centr yeah . "
A,Other,"Tasks . "
B,Task,"This is the most competing prototypes I've found . "
B,Task,"But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons "
A,Task,"And they are small . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so it's very lousy . "
C,Task,"Of course . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So you so you move to the next the next one . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so I talk about the problem . "
B,Task,"And then I I look at the user manual "
B,Task,"they are a hundred pages thick comm "
B,Task,"so we don't want that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . "
B,Task,"You can navigate on T_V_ screen "
B,Task,"and we can the user's preference "
B,Task,"and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ "
B,Task,"and we need some to do some preprocessing . "
B,Task,"From the technical aspect comm the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller comm right ? "
B,Task,"And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ . "
A,Elicit,"What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ "
B,Task,"Yeah comm all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the "
A,Minor,"than the "
C,Minor,"So we have to t "
A,Elicit,"So we should have specific T_V_ ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Or ? We can use this . "
C,Task,"We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm we don't "
B,Elicit,"Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm not the T_V_s . "
A,Task,"J j just the remote control . "
C,Task,"I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So i the processing on on the remote controller "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"so it can u be used in any T_V_ comm any conventional T_V_ sets ? "
A,Minor,"we . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Mm . Okay . "
A,Other,"Speech recognition . "
B,Task,"N yeah comm that's all . "
B,Task,"The next one ? "
B,Task,"So I come up with a simple design comm "
B,Task,"just keep the v navigation buttons . "
C,Task,"Yes comm that's a good idea comm I think . "
A,Task,"Keep the navigation "
C,Task,"We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh "
A,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Well comm f four five buttons comm it's sufficient . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"It's easy to build comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
C,Task,"it does not consume much power . "
A,Minor,". "
B,Task,"Okay comm that's all . "
D,Task,"Oh comm but you have a catch there comm "
D,Task,"um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine comm then . "
C,Task,"Well comm then y you you go to the main menu "
C,Task,"and uh you have uh go to channel "
C,Minor,"and then uh you can "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"No comm because you choose by channel comm "
B,Task,"so you choose by T_V_ program "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh huh huh huh . "
C,Minor,"Maybe you "
B,Task,"so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm hmm hmm . "
B,Task,"If you go by channel comm you don't have to do that . "
C,Minor,". "
C,Task,"but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"So you are "
B,Minor,"Ah . "
B,Other,"Ah comm a big jump . "
D,Task,"Yeah then yeah that's right . "
B,Task,"A mouse or "
C,Task,"Well comm not a mouse "
C,Task,"but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right comm left comm up comm down comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm hmm hmm . Okay . "
C,Task,"well comm the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator comm maybe directly comm or "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"But we'll see . "
A,Elicit,"How the this remote ? "
B,Task,"Uh it's gonna be small . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm of course small . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So it'll beep if you wanna find it "
D,Other,"too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . "
B,Minor,"you just uh shout y h just "
B,Task,"it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"that's . "
B,Task,"I dunno how bu "
D,Task,"just give it a name and we call him . "
B,Task,"And responds to you comm and "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . Yeah comm that's right . "
C,Task,"Okay comm so uh next presentation "
A,Task,"Participant four . "
A,Task,"So Harry . "
D,Task,"Okay comm after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface comm I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested comm then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines comm "
D,Task,"and the users send the feedbacks comm "
D,Task,"and based on that These are the findings which we got "
D,Task,"and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote "
D,Task,"but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier "
C,Task,"Well I I think it will be a comm yes comm a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts "
D,Task,"An it does how feasible it is . "
B,Minor,"I- mm . "
B,Task,"But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . "
B,Task,"I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary "
D,Task,"Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"We just have the "
C,Task,"And this can allow to choose the the program comm for instance without uh adding uh buttons "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so it's a good idea . "
D,Task,"it's not going to take much space also . "
D,Task,"It's going to be very slim . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And next one was the size of the remote control . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"It has to be of course a very slim and small one . "
D,Task,"And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"so this is an important criteria here is "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Elicit,"But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . "
D,Task,"I mean we have to look for a trade-off . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"The features and the cost . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Maybe not less comm but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort comm "
D,Task,"Little bit more if it's with extra features . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"It "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"yeah comm extra features . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm s s speech is a important extra feature I think "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . That's right . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But is it useful or not u "
C,Minor,"Well comm uh "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"There is in the "
D,Task,"I mean comm for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Or they say movie name "
D,Task,"or I don't go for movie names "
D,Task,"but only for the numbers on the channel comm or volume up comm volume down comm brightness comm contrast . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So comm I think this should be a good idea comm to put this features . "
D,Task,"And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . "
C,Task,"we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control comm so "
D,Minor,"Mm comm I think "
C,Minor,"I well "
A,Minor,"I think i "
C,Task,"it will be alright . "
B,Elicit,"What is the teletext ? "
A,Task,"If it's necessary can you can do that . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"We can integrate small microphone in the remote "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so it's not really a problem . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"What about lighting adaptive options ? "
D,Task,"Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting comm but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . "
A,Task,"According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? "
B,Task,"Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? "
B,Task,"It's very complex . "
D,Minor,"I mean "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I think it's a bit complex too "
D,Task,"I mean yeah comm it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Other,"For our next product comm our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light "
D,Minor,"I think "
B,Other,"Yeah comm then we can conclude that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but it's quite possible "
B,Task,"but maybe not in this project . "
A,Task,"So we have I think we have s still we have couple of minutes . "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
A,Elicit,"So any things to to discuss ? "
D,Task,"I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing . "
A,Elicit,"Or any suggestions ? "
D,Task,"The speech interface "
D,Task,"and uh less uh reasonable uh cost . "
A,Task,"Expensive . "
A,Task,"Price . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And the lighting adaptation "
D,Task,"and the teletext . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"If you are watching an foreign movie comm you get subtitles sometimes . "
B,Other,"Yeah . Okay . "
D,Task,"And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German . "
C,Minor,". "
D,Task,"So comm the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . "
C,Task,"Function . "
D,Task,"That should be a good uh point . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah comm but well what about the the new project's requirement ? "
C,Task,"I I I think we should give up with teletext comm no ? "
A,Minor,"I think we we can we "
A,Minor,"is the . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Well comm so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Because if "
B,Elicit,"Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? "
B,Other,"I didn't quite understand "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . "
D,Task,"We already have some . "
C,Task,"So if we already have it in our remote control "
A,Task,"So you have to anticipate the the future ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"The future demand comm market demand . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm to desi "
C,Task,"well comm not not to implement it comm "
C,Task,"but to well comm to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah comm in an in an easy manner comm if is possible . "
B,Task,"The functionality in the future . "
A,Minor,". "
A,Task,"In future . "
B,Task,"Alright . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital comm right . "
B,Task,"All the programmes comm everything will be in digital than analog . "
B,Task,"Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm . "
C,Minor,"Okay . So "
A,Task,"Okay . So let's go for the the lunch break comm "
A,Task,"and we will meet after . "
C,Other,"Okay comm thank you . "
D,Other,"Okay comm thank you . "
B,Other,"Okay . Thank you . "
