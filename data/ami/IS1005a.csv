A,Task,"Uh comm I guess you all know what is it about comm "
A,Task,"you all received the email comm I guess . "
A,Task,"Uh comm we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control . "
A,Task,"So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project . "
A,Other,"And uh so I'm present myself . "
A,Task,"I'm Fabien Cardinaux "
A,Task,"and uh I I guess you can present yourself . "
A,Task,"So I dunno comm you can starts . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"so my name is Petre . "
B,Task,"You can call me Petre comm or Peter if you like . "
B,Task,"I don't care . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Uh my name's Bob Mor . "
A,Elicit,"And you are ? In the project ? "
B,Task,"Uh comm in the project I'm supposed to be the technic . "
D,Other,"Oh comm sorry . "
D,Task,"'Kay . So my name's Bob Morris . "
D,Task,"I'm the Marketing Expert for this project . "
B,Other,"Bob comm "
D,Task,"Bob yeah . "
B,Task,"okay . "
C,Task,"My name is Hamed Getabdar comm "

B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So comm uh comm so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project comm "
A,Minor,"so um We are gooding "
A,Task,"we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project . "
A,Task,"We are talking about the project plan comm "
A,Task,"and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on comm "
A,Task,"and comm yeah . "
A,Task,"So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . "
A,Task,"Um . So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control . "
A,Task,"So it should be comm of course comm new and original comm "
A,Task,"and um it should be trendy comm and user friendly . "
A,Task,"That mean it's a very challenging project comm "
A,Minor,"and uh "
A,Minor,"uh . So w it's "
A,Task,"we will try to do our best comm "
A,Task,"and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy . "
A,Minor,"So comm um "
A,Task,"So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project ? "
A,Task,"So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities "
A,Task,"and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Yeah and everything is will be like this . "
A,Task,"Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project . "
A,Task,"So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . "
A,Minor,"So uh . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Uh . So uh "
A,Task,"So I will ask you all to do the same . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Just to get used to the whiteboard . "
B,Other,"So probably I would try to try to draw the animal . "
B,Elicit,"Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ? "
B,Task,"I I th I think I should . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm you can draw the picture comm of course . "
D,Task,"Yeah go ahead . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm so . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Other,"Okay comm American comm um . Um . "
B,Task,"I would use the bird . "
B,Task,"So I tried to sketch it out . "
B,Task,"I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it comm but ah . "
B,Elicit,"Can you recognise it as a bird ? "
B,Task,"Okay it's your turn to "
D,Task,"Okay comm okay . "
D,Task,"So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"That's its head . "
D,Task,"Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I dunno if I should go with this . "
B,Task,"Oh it's okay . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
C,Task,"If it is enough line . "
C,Other,"I'm sorry . "
D,Task,"Maybe put it up "
D,Task,"Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I should get used to the tool comm so . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Oh just wait a little bit . "
B,Task,"C could we put it here comm to make it as straight as possible ? "
B,Task,"Ah probably not . "
C,Task,"They should be remote . "
B,Task,"Okay comm it it works like this . "
D,Task,"Uh comm that's better . "
C,Other,"Okay comm thanks . "
D,Task,"Your lapel microphone's fallen off . "
B,Elicit,"Are you left-handed ? "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Oh comm pity . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Should I clean ? "
C,Task,"Okay comm I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful comm "
C,Task,"so if I want to write it here comm I think I can . "
A,Task,"Never mind . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"Ah comm it's maybe better if you leave it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Maybe we should just continue . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm don't worry about it . "
A,Task,"comm no worry . "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"You won't draw them comm or ? "
A,Task,"You can draw it comm if you want . "
C,Task,"I dunno if I can . "
B,Task,"Just try . "
B,Task,"I would like to see how it looks like . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"It may be like a cow or I dunno comm whatever . "
C,Task,"I'm not good very good in drawing . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so this is very "
C,Task,"It's a bird comm I think . "
C,Task,"I dunno what is it . "
B,Task,"No comm I think it's clear . "
C,Other,"Four . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . I'm shameful "
D,Task,"Oh that's good comm it's good . "
B,Task,"It's okay . "
B,Task,"It's in it's indeed beautiful . "
A,Task,"Good . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm and strong . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Bob . Have to remember it . "
B,Other,"Bob . "
A,Minor,"So good um "
A,Task,"So comm let's talk about money . "
A,Task,"Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro . "
A,Task,"And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro . "
A,Task,"And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world . "
A,Task,"So n not only for Switzerland comm but for the world . "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Minor,"So comm um . "
A,Minor,"The "
A,Task,"We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro . "
B,Task,"Per unit comm I guess . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
B,Task,"Y oh okay . "
A,Task,"Um comm so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control comm and any idea ? "
A,Elicit,"So comm if you have some experience comm good or bad comm with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . "
A,Task,"Anything . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Well comm from experience comm um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small comm "
D,Task,"and it's been very hard to to to use comm because there's so many buttons comm "
D,Task,"and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what comm "
D,Task,"and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . "
D,Minor,"Um and and normally you only every use comm "
D,Task,"you know comm on a T_V_ remote you only ever use comm mostly comm you know comm f four or f six buttons . Um . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"So it's frustrated me in the past comm th that . "
B,Other,"Okay comm I have also some points uh . "
B,Task,"Maybe two points . "
B,Task,"Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light comm "
B,Task,"so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room comm so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery comm so . "
B,Task,"So something like this . "
B,Task,"And the second thing comm f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control . "
B,Task,"But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Ah comm okay . Okay . "
B,Task,"You know comm some slider or "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Not just two discrete buttons for volume comm "
D,Minor,"Okay comm n "
B,Minor,"but something which "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"Is that because the of the discrete volume levels comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"or is that "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down comm or or make a high volume . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly "
B,Minor,"Ah comm n . "
A,Minor,"and it can "
B,Task,"If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"also if y when you take the the remote control comm for example on the table comm you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud comm and "
A,Task,"you have a heart attack . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah comm f It depends what what you feel about that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards comm "
B,Task,"but if you have some more notes on that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Other,"Uh I Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"so you can "
A,Elicit,"Do you have something ? "
C,Task,"just a simple experience . "
C,Task,"I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves comm "
C,Task,"because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm that's true . "
A,Task,"Yeah without obstacles and . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . Let's continue . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"I have a meeting in five minutes comm "
A,Task,"so maybe we should hurry . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"Um . So we will close uh this meeting . "
B,Other,"just a second . "
A,Task,"So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Uh . The So I will ask you to do some work . "
A,Task,"Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control comm "
A,Task,"start to to have new idea and "
B,Elicit,"Which i which is Hamed comm ? "
A,Task,"read about "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"He's the Industrial Designer ? "
D,Task,"No comm you're the Industrial Designer . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh I am the Technical Designer comm "
A,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"I dunno which one comm uh v . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I think that's the first . I_D_ . Industrial Designer . "
A,Minor,"Industry and Oh . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "

A,Minor,"So comm um "
A,Task,"For the User Interface Designer comm which is Hamed um comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"uh comm you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control . "
B,Minor,"I see . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And for the Marketing uh Manager comm I dunno comm okay comm which is Bob comm uh "
A,Task,"you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control . "
A,Task,"Um comm you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach . "
B,Other,"Sign . "
A,Task,"Yep finished . "
A,Task,"So I see you in thirty minutes . "
D,Task,"Great comm okay . "
