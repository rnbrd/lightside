A,Elicit,"Do you need to change anything on it ? "
D,Task,"Um Mm comm don't think so . "
A,Other,"Because otherwise I will already open it . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Unless uh things have suddenly change again . "
A,Elicit,"Is it much changes ? "
D,Task,"Uh don't know . "
D,Task,"Maybe uh you've got new information comm like uh last time . "
A,Task,"Uh I didn't No no . I do hot have Only the same information . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Hello comm Sebastian . "
C,Other,"Hello hello Mister P_M_ . "
A,Task,"I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well comm in the control room . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"that's where the thinking goes on . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Other,"it's that Roo again comm always late . "
A,Other,"Bongiorno . "
B,Other,"Bongiorno . "
C,Other,"I think you should punish him . "
C,Task,"You're the P_M_ . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Punish . "
A,Other,"I see some interesting "
A,Minor,"okay . "
C,Other,"Possibilities comm yeah ? "
B,Other,"You wish . "
A,Other,"People comm welcome back . "
B,Other,"Welcome . Uh "
A,Task,"The third meeting . "
D,Other,"Oop . "
A,Other,"Um I have some points I would like to uh some some issues I would like to point out . "
A,Elicit,"Um first of all comm um if you make minutes yourself as well comm uh like Sebastian does comm um could you put them on the shared folder ? "
A,Task,"If you do not make minutes comm no problem comm "
A,Task,"but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"so I could uh can uh um use that in the in the report . "
A,Task,"Um the second thing comm um I was th uh s thinking to myself comm I have this little remote control comm and I'm talking to it comm but I still need to point to the television comm "
A,Task,"because it works with infrared . "
A,Task,"That's quite strange . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"So "
A,Task,"We'll come to that later comm I g I think . "
A,Task,"Um the agenda for now "
A,Elicit,"uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ? "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Not at all . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um "
A,Task,"we wi we will have your individual presentations comm "
A,Task,"uh then the decision on the remote control concept comm "
A,Task,"um and uh the closing . "
A,Task,"Forty minutes in total for this . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations comm um the progress you've made . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first comm "
D,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation . "
D,Other,"Hmm ? "
B,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Just press the okay button comm it works . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Other,"My method ? "
C,Other,"How surprising . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"findings . Uh "
D,Task,"Ease of use is important comm "
D,Task,"but uh innovation is more important comm "
D,Task,"and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . "
D,Task,"And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes comm shoes and furniture comm "
D,Task,"and that they want spongy material . "
D,Task,"Probably watch too much Sponge Bob . "
D,Task,"Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes uh m material . "
D,Task,"But we since we are concentrating on uh the younger group "
A,Task,"Uh w wait a sec wait a se "
C,Task,"Oh wait uh wait up . "
A,Elicit,"uh could you go to the previous slide ? "
A,Task,"Um because I'm taking minutes "
D,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"Um were the important themes enclose . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"okay . "
A,Task,"The feel of to be spongy "
C,Elicit,"Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ? "
D,Minor,"Well comm uh "
D,Task,"one example given was this comm "
D,Minor,"so um "
D,Task,"I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something . "
C,Task,"Not something dull . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But they like dark colours comm "
B,Minor,"you said in the p "
D,Task,"No comm uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"then I suggest that "
B,Task,"the corporate colours are grey and yellow . "
D,Minor,"But "
B,Minor,"I had "
C,Elicit,"But can you can you go back to that slide ? "
C,Minor,"The uh "
D,Elicit,"Which one ? "
D,Elicit,"This ? "
C,Task,"just one slide back comm "
C,Task,"no no no . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"and the feel of the material has to be spongy . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Elicit,"Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also comm do you think ? "
D,Minor,"Uh well comm "
D,Task,"it might . "
D,Task,"But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . "
D,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so so comm yeah comm "
A,Minor,"it might not be t uh it "
A,Task,"it shouldn't be too hard . "
A,Minor,"It it "
A,Task,"maybe it rubber "
A,Minor,"or or "
D,Task,"Yeah comm exactly . "
A,Task,"yeah . Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"and like uh the older group likes familiar materials comm "
B,Minor,"Or we could make oh . "
D,Task,"but that doesn't mean we should use wood comm "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"this this is an example of what they would like . "
D,Task,"But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group comm "
D,Task,"I think we should use soft materials "
D,Task,"and uh make it colourful "
D,Task,"or uh like cell phones comm exch exchangeable covers . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"that's interesting . "
C,Task,"It's quite interesting . "
A,Task,"You could make a few v very colourful ones comm and uh a very traditional co cover . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"o o "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"It's the it's the rubber uh cover . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it is comm it is i yeah . "
B,Task,"And it's uh colourful . "
B,Task,"It looks likes a banana . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We have the fruit comm we have the colours . We have the simple design . "
A,Elicit,"Do you know the phone ? "
C,Task,"I don't know the phone comm "
C,Task,"but I can imagine it . "
A,Task,"It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five comm "
B,Task,"Um thirty five . "
A,Task,"I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away comm "
C,Other,"Oh comm that one comm yes . "
A,Minor,"the very "
B,Minor,"And the b "
B,Task,"the light blue and it's also in yellow . "
C,Task,"Now I kn uh oh comm I know comm I know . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Task,"I I've seen it . I've seen it . "
A,Elicit,"You kn you know comm Ruud comm as well ? "
A,Minor,"About th "
D,Task,"I've seen it comm "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"Okay . Okay . Um uh "
A,Elicit,"okay . "
A,Minor,"Do you have uh thit that was "
D,Task,"'Kay . Uh that's about it . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials . "
D,Task,"Uh soft material . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So So "
C,Task,"ease of use is important comm "
C,Task,"but technology is twice as important . "
C,Elicit,"And what was even more important ? "
D,Task,"Uh the fancy look and feel . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"that's the most important thing for our customers . "
D,Task,"Yes . Apparently . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"Roo comm "
B,Elicit,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"could you do your presentation ? "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I don't ha really have much to add comm "
B,Task,"um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
A,Task,"it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about . "
B,Task,"Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . "
B,Task,"These are both with uh with voice recognition comm "
B,Task,"but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um comm well comm a weird um shape . "
A,Task,"Shape . "
B,Minor,"So I suggest I couldn't uh "
B,Task,"I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper . "
B,Task,"But it didn't work . "
B,Task,"My pen didn't load um the information . "
B,Task,"So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um PowerPoint . "
B,Task,"But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic comm "
C,Task,"so that's very good . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And what I'm thinking about comm maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip "
A,Task,"um I mean this is how you hold a remote control . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt comm too slippery comm "
C,Task,"Slippery . "
A,Minor,"s because um "
B,Task,"But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone comm it's rubber . "
C,Task,"You have to grab it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm exactly . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm ex for your fingers comm yeah . "
C,Task,"so you can get a really good grip on it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . "
C,Task,"It's it's a lot easier . "
A,Task,"Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"m "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Other,"But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation . "
A,Task,"okay . "
A,Task,"Okay comm good . "
B,Other,"Great . "
B,Minor,"Oh and um "
B,Other,"to add on um Ruud's information comm "
B,Task,"in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh comm well comm the the fancy colours and uh and so on comm "
B,Task,"and still have the ease of use comm "
B,Task,"because we have an easy interface . "
B,Task,"And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Way too much I think for our goal comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"So if you have the voice recognition comm you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"b but I think we'll "
C,Other,"but I'll I'll go into that comm "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . "
C,Task,"Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division comm "
C,Task,"and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . "
C,Task,"Uh these are the things we've looked at . "
C,Task,"And of course I used the web to uh find my information . "
C,Task,"About the casing comm we have three different casing possibilities . "
C,Task,"We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh "
C,Task,"we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box . "
C,Task,"I'm sorry "
C,Task,"I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . "
C,Task,"We have uh a curved one . "
C,Task,"It's uh curved in two dimensions . "
C,Task,"You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . "
C,Task,"So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape comm "
C,Task,"which is curved in three dimension . "
C,Minor,"I c "
C,Task,"I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control comm something like that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"But it's quite uh advanced "
C,Task,"and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . "
C,Task,"Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . "
C,Task,"We can use plastic comm "
C,Task,"which is uh very slippery "
C,Task,"and maybe not so nice comm "
C,Task,"but you can give it any colour comm "
C,Task,"uh which is the same for rubber comm "
C,Task,"but it's not slippery . "
C,Task,"We can use wood and titanium . "
C,Minor,"Well comm um "
C,Task,"we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . "
C,Task,"And these latex cases comm there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source . "
C,Other,"Which brings me to the different energy sources . "
C,Minor,"Um well comm "
C,Task,"we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls . "
C,Task,"You really have to imagine like winding up your uh "
B,Task,"Great . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Minor,"I d "
A,Task,"it would be very new to the market comm "
A,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"It would be very new comm "
C,Task,"but it's a kind of a retro uh style comm I think . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh Well comm "
C,Task,"this is quite interesting . "
C,Task,"Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . "
C,Minor,"So um "
C,Task,"when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall comm whatever you wish . "
B,Task,"Like the watch . "
C,Minor,"It have it "
C,Task,"it has to move comm that's the the sense of it . "
C,Task,"And you can store the energy in the in the thing . "
A,Task,"I think um comm if if I can hook on to that comm um the kinetic thing is very funny . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"It's very funny indeed . "
A,Task,"I mean solar is of course it's nice comm "
A,Task,"but it's comm well comm your uh your calculator has a solar panel . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Indeed . "
A,Minor,"Um hand dynamo "
B,Elicit,"But if you're watching a movie comm how many times uh you take the the remote control and and "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Minor,"maybe m "
B,Minor,"if uh if you have a watch comm "
B,Task,"you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I know . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Yes . "
B,Task,"You you walk "
B,Minor,"and uh but uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . "
B,Task,"you you're sitting on a couch . "
C,Task,"the the shaking of your body comm which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake comm uh it charges it . "
C,Task,"But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . "
C,Task,"So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time comm and you want t to switch uh the channel or something comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"And wha "
C,Minor,"well comm "
C,Minor,"m "
C,Task,"it might not work . "
C,Task,"So that's something you have to keep in mind . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries comm "
C,Task,"so we can save on the batteries "
C,Task,"and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy comm use the kinetic energy comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and otherwise use the batteries . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power . "
C,Task,"Uh yes comm it does . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"I'll come to that later . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And we of course have the traditional uh solar power comm "
C,Task,"which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . "
C,Task,"The user interface controls comm "
C,Task,"um of course we have the push-buttons "
C,Task,"and uh we also have scroll-wheels . "
C,Task,"And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . "
C,Task,"So it's just like a mouse . "
C,Task,"You can scroll 'em comm "
C,Task,"you can also push it . "
C,Task,"Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays comm "
C,Task,"which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"uh and we also have double scroll-buttons comm "
C,Task,"which are just two of these things . "
C,Task,"So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting comm the the thing with the the round with the four "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round . "
C,Task,"Yes . That is possible too . Yes . "
B,Minor,"But I th I don't think uh "
B,Task,"the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels . "
A,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"I d "
B,Task,"I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Minor,"mayb "
C,Minor,"uh well comm "
C,Task,"m me neither . "
C,Task,"Maybe when you integrate some functions . "
A,Task,"This will be the remote comm "
B,Elicit,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"Um with uh maybe a channel selector . "
A,Elicit,"What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm uh that's a possibility comm "
C,Task,"Uh it's do it's done before . "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"Because this is how you keep it "
C,Task,"Yes . It's quite quite good comm yes . "
B,Elicit,"But Flores comm think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for "
A,Task,"Volume ? "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Minor,"it's it "
C,Minor,"well comm "
C,Minor,"i "
C,Task,"what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel . "
B,Minor,"A "
B,Minor,"volume comm okay . "
C,Task,"There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . "
C,Task,"You just use the wheel . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Elicit,"what about mute ? "
C,Other,"About mute . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Minor,"Thi i i m I guess uh th "
C,Task,"yes . "
A,Task,"this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"okay . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"that that that's one possibility comm okay . "
A,Task,"And click it to muten the device . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"okay . It's quite goods . "
A,Task,"And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . Yes . "
A,Task,"So maybe um I guess that that's something you two uh need to think about . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Uh Ruud comm wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel . "
D,Minor,"Um Uh well comm "
B,Task,"Wheel . "
D,Task,"it's obvious obviously new . "
D,Task,"So it might attract uh the young customers . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"But it's done before comm "
C,Task,"uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio comm pocket radios . "
C,Task,"We use this . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And Well comm "
C,Task,"it's it's been done years ago "
C,Task,"and I don't see it anywhere now . "
C,Minor,"So maybe it's not no . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"all the Sony telephones use it comm for example comm for volume . "
A,Task,"Nokia has a well comm okay comm it's not really a scroll-wheel comm but on their side th the the volume button is on the side comm "
A,Task,"because you gri grab it like this . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yes comm "
C,Task,"but it uses two separate buttons . "
A,Task,"Yeah . I know comm it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"It doesn't use a . "
C,Minor,"Well . Uh "
C,Task,"something for uh Roo here . "
A,Task,"For you too comm "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said comm um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control comm so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . "
C,Task,"Wi within reach . Yes comm you have to . "
B,Task,"So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Sebastian . Um "
C,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"um we have to know comm if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case comm um you must use these push uh push-buttons . "
C,Task,"There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . "
C,Task,"There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels comm "
C,Task,"because it's all curved . "
C,Task,"There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So that's a limitation . "
C,Other,"About um the components comm uh just the hardware . "
C,Task,"We basically have uh three types of chips we can use "
C,Task,"and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . "
C,Task,"Uh we have a simple comm regular and advanced chip . "
C,Task,"And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker comm "
C,Task,"which is a little cryptic uh to me . "
C,Task,"But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about . "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah comm "
B,Minor,"you can "
B,Task,"um I have some information about it . "
B,Task,"Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute comm let's say mute . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So so "
C,Minor,"okay . "
B,Task,"Um you programme it comm you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and uh when you speak in the the remote control comm it repeats uh your saying . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"that's the sample sensor . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So if you say mute comm it says mute again comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and then it's um well comm I believe it's uh "
A,Task,"It performs the action . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So you say mute comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"he repeats mute "
B,Task,"and you makes a computer sound mute comm "
B,Task,"and then goes to the mute function . "
C,Other,"Okay . Okay comm "
C,Task,"so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip comm I thought . "
C,Task,"Um no op I'm not very sure . "
C,Task,"No comm it's not in here . "
C,Task,"If we want to use the L_C_D_ display comm we really need the advanced version comm "
C,Task,"which is a bit l little bit more costly . "
C,Task,"If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . "
C,Task,"And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip comm "
C,Task,"which is a bit cheaper . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Uh well uh "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"d did we already decide on the display ? "
A,Minor,"To "
C,Task,"Um no comm "
C,Task,"but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Well comm "
B,Minor,"I don't have "
B,Task,"um I haven't looked for uh for information about it comm "
B,Minor,"but I don't think information uh "
B,Task,"y I don't think you need it on a display . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Especially when when we have to look at a cost comm I don't think uh "
C,Task,"I I don't think either . "
C,Task,"No . I don't think you need it . "
B,Task,"'cause uh uh all any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen comm "
A,Task,"On screen display . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Okay comm well "
A,Task,"Okay "
A,Minor,"th "
C,Task,"my conclusion comm um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than I thought . "
C,Task,"I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing comm "
C,Task,"but they seem to like natural uh stuff . "
C,Task,"So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . "
C,Task,"Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . "
C,Task,"It's more reliable comm "
C,Task,"it's cheaper . "
A,Task,"Okay . Good . "
C,Task,"So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . "
A,Minor,"Kineti "
A,Minor,"okay . "
C,Task,"The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility . "
C,Task,"It's it's more advanced comm "
C,Task,"but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"it's maybe a bit too too flashy comm "
C,Minor,"Otherwise it will not too advanced comm "
A,Minor,"too "
C,Minor,"uh well . "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Task,"It's in in in some way it can give us an advance comm "
C,Task,"because you will save on your batteries . "
C,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but that that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"And I think it's more robust . "
C,Task,"It's more uh Uh it's more functional . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Okay . "
B,Task,"But what about um the markets uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? "
B,Minor,"So if you use titanium "
A,Task,"No no comm "
A,Task,"but the uh um that's what Sebastian said . "
C,Task,"The titanium thing uh we have to skip it . "
A,Task,"He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"But but yet comm I understood that the market is different . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Other,"sorry . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So um "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and we should uh use wood or something like that . "
D,Minor,"And "
B,Minor,"And I would think "
D,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"No comm "
D,Minor,"the "
A,Minor,"r "
A,Task,"rubber with colours . "
D,Minor,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"the older people liked wood . "
C,Other,"Oh okay comm "
C,Other,"sorry . "
C,Task,"So it it needs to be rubber . "
D,Minor,"No the "
A,Task,"Colourful "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"the younger people liked soft material . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"and "
C,Task,"Okay comm spongy materials . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm um well um "
C,Task,"these scroll-wheels comm I think uh they they can be they can be handy . "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"And they can be implemented with a regular chip ? "
C,Task,"Yes comm they can . "
C,Task,"But they really need the regular chip comm "
C,Task,"you cannot use the sa simple "
B,Other,"Okay comm "
B,Minor,"but we also "
B,Task,"uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"I'm not very sure . "
C,Task,"Maybe that's an uh a different "
B,Other,"oh comm "
A,Elicit,"But but do we want the curved uh uh design comm "
B,Minor,"evalu "
A,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"I think so comm "
C,Task,"if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design comm i uh it's too dull . "
A,Minor,"I "
A,Task,"it's too dull . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I don't think c our customers will like it . "
C,Task,"And um if you uh take the double-curved comm uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So I think this is the best of two worlds . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Because it it's of cour "
C,Task,"It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's very unlogical . "
B,Task,"But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"the "
A,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"there has to be some pointing at . "
C,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"It depends also on your on your "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"if you if you take your hand before it comm okay comm it won't work comm "
B,Task,"but you can point it just to the other wall . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"it depends on your walls actually . "
A,Task,"If you have uh have um smooth walls comm it it it probably you're probably right . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But if you have carpets on the wall comm which our natural loving friends probably do have comm then um yeah comm th th it might be a bit more of a issue . "
C,Task,"All lights get absorbed comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Task,"because the walls they they reflect the infrared light . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So it has an "
C,Task,"it's easier . "
C,Task,"Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip . "
B,Task,"And the regular chip . "
C,Minor,"I think uh it gives us the advantage of "
B,Task,"And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . "
C,Task,"Yes comm yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I like the scroll wheels uh idea . "
C,Task,"And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I don't think it it's any uh value added thing . "
B,Task,"No . Think so too . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Minor,"it looks "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"uh yeah comm well um "
A,Task,"according to Ruud comm the the the market likes um new flashy technology comm "
C,Task,"Technology . "
A,Minor,"and I mean L_C_D_ is "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"It's not very flashy and new . "
A,Minor,"well comm "
A,Task,"ok I know comm "
A,Task,"but it's m it's less um s standard "
D,Task,"Standard ? "
A,Minor,"than than "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . "
A,Task,"That's the problem . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance comm I would say do integrate it comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"But we already have the scroll-wheels comm the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition comm the rubber comm the fancy colours . "
A,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh I think our customers will go insane . "
A,Task,"Okay comm okay . "
C,Task,"It's it's too much . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Okay comm I I agree . "
A,Minor,"I think i "
A,Elicit,"Ruud comm do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts "
A,Minor,"or "
D,Task,"Nah comm um n no comm I don't think so . "
D,Minor,"M "
A,Elicit,"No ? "
A,Minor,"Sebast "
A,Minor,"uh nee comm "
A,Elicit,"Roo ? Roo comm do you have any other "
B,Task,"Um no . Nothing more . "
A,Other,"Nothing more . Um "
C,Minor,"Okay . Uh "
C,Minor,"the n the next phase will be um the um not the "
A,Minor,"Sebas "
C,Elicit,"what is the next phase f Flores ? "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"we we need to describe uh decisions now . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So um "
C,Minor,"So i "
A,Task,"on the energy comm well comm we decided . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Chip . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm okay . "
A,Minor,"User interface um "
B,Elicit,"Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? "
C,Task,"Yes comm they can work . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Other,"Sorry comm "
C,Task,"They cannot work with double-curved . "
B,Other,"yeah . "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
B,Other,"sorry . "
C,Task,"That's that's problem . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"I'll check it for you . "
A,Task,"Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . "
A,Task,"I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . "
A,Task,"Uh you talked about it before comm the colours comm grey and yellow . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Keep it in mind . "
A,Task,"And um the buttons comm well we talked about it now . "
A,Task,"The next phase comm um Sebastian comm um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And for you comm the product evaluation . "
A,Task,"Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that . "
A,Task,"Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"And I'm going uh to plan my holidays . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"So you will be on the Bahamas . Uh "
B,Elicit,"The project drawing is for the next "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"it's it's "
A,Task,"uh when we come back in thirty minutes comm uh you will have a uh prototype ready . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm right . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ? "
A,Task,"Yeah ? I can . "
A,Elicit,"Um maybe one of you could write it down . "
C,Other,"I'll do . "
A,Other,"Great . "
A,Task,"Um Uh you you need to help me . Um "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"W "
C,Task,"start with the casing . "
A,Task,"The casing is curved comm single-curved . "
B,Task,"Single-curved . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm single-curved case . Okay . "
C,Elicit,"What about the energy source ? "
A,Task,"Traditional batteries uh and solar . "
B,Elicit,"But can there be uh wor can they work together ? "
B,Elicit,"Or do we have to choose between them ? "
B,Minor,"'Cause if we have to choose "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"they can be complementary . "
C,Task,"I I think they can . Yes . "
A,Minor,"Uh al al I uh "
B,Elicit,"yeah ? "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Well comm uh "
B,Elicit,"What if not ? "
A,Minor,"Every device "
C,Task,"It it should be . "
C,Task,"There should be really no problem . "
C,Task,"They can be supplementary . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"That's no problem . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Okay comm um "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"So uh uh "
A,Minor,"th "
C,Elicit,"just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar . "
A,Task,"Battery and solar comm yeah . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"What about uh the finishing of the case ? "
C,Elicit,"We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm with colourful rubber . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers comm "
A,Task,"but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish . "
C,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . uh black and yellow . "
A,Task,"Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Grey and yellow . "
C,Other,"Grey yellow comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yellow case and grey buttons comm I think . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course comm "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours . "
C,Minor,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"I think it's uh it's not very dull . "
C,Task,"It's quite modern actually . "
C,Elicit,"Don't you think ? "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before . "
B,Minor,"I believe the "
B,Minor,"But you have already "
B,Task,"um you must have a red uh on and off button . "
B,Minor,"And um Well well "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"it it doesn't have to be red . "
A,Task,"Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . "
A,Task,"Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours comm "
A,Task,"it should be a full colour cover with such an image "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"or or "
A,Task,"I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group comm I guess . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Or black and yellow . "
A,Task,"Black and yellow comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . "
C,Task,"Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"there is . "
B,Task,"Just a week ago comm a keyboard manufacturer would print comm "
C,Minor,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"I've read . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"with and uh "
C,Minor,"Yes comm "
C,Task,"but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . "
C,Task,"They're actually very slow in its techniques . "
B,Minor,"No . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"So So I'm afraid it's not possible . "
A,Task,"so we have to deal with wh what's possible here . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um "
A,Task,"more f more more decisions we made . Um Um "
B,Task,"A scroll-wheel . "
A,Task,"The scroll-heel . Yes comm "
A,Task,"the voice recognition we already decided . "
B,Task,"Voice recognition comm of course . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so "
C,Other,"scroll-wheel . "
C,Task,"But there will be some additional buttons comm I guess . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And th the they should be spongy also comm "
C,Task,"because they're they're rubber too . "
A,Task,"Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two . "
B,Other,"What what did you say ? "
C,Minor,"Well uh "
C,Minor,"you can use "
C,Minor,"well comm "
C,Task,"when you use the buttons comm they'll they'll be made of rubber too . "
C,Task,"So it has th the spongy uh feel also . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"or you could use plastic buttons . In the rubber . "
A,Task,"I think rubber is nice . "
A,Minor,"Because it uh i "
A,Elicit,"I mean what do you touch "
A,Task,"the button comm "
A,Elicit,"and what do they want "
A,Task,"spongy uh uh devices comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"b "
A,Minor,"or or i "
B,Task,"But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually . "
A,Minor,". "
B,Task,"What I said in the in the first uh discussion comm uh the digit six on the button comm it will disappear when it's from rubber . "
A,Minor,"Uh is that "
A,Elicit,"uh does our our supplier say so ? "
B,Minor,"It is not uh something uh "
B,Task,"it's no information I read about it or so comm "
B,Minor,"but it's just from "
D,Elicit,"Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits "
D,Elicit,"or uh leave them to the speech recognition ? "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Minor,"but but uh it "
D,Task,"'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"You could place a "
A,Task,"um uh this this would be the button . "
D,Minor,"There the icons . "
A,Task,"The scroll-wheel comm I mean . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm b yeah . "
A,Task,"And you could place the indica th th the signals the "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"So you don't touch the icons that much . "
C,Task,"That's okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's possible comm "
B,Task,"but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case . "
B,Task,"So still then comm if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control comm you just rub on the cover comm so you rub on the painting . "
A,Task,"No no comm there's no painting comm "
A,Task,"only uh yellow or But it's into the rubber . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but but the the plus or the minus . "
C,Other,"Yes comm the signs . "
B,Minor,"You have to draw the "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"but this is on the pla "
A,Other,"yeah comm I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"it's on the cover . "
B,Minor,"So if you uh "
B,Task,"You just move the problem . "
A,Elicit,"What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ? "
C,Other,"Uh I see what you mean . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"maybe that's possible comm "
C,Task,"because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . "
C,Task,"So maybe they can combine these two . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Well actually comm "
A,Task,"we should have it the other way around comm I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . "
A,Task,"I mean comm this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But the front comm on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"I mean "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"I'm I'm not so sure comm "
C,Minor,"I think it c should be "
B,Minor,"Y "
B,Elicit,"uh can you separate these uh these "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"I'm not sure comm "
C,Other,"I have to ask with manufacturing comm "
C,Task,"but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want comm "
C,Task,"because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel comm "
C,Task,"and that's what you get with rubber . "
C,Task,"So if you want the spongy feel comm you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber . "
A,Other,"I know comm "
A,Elicit,"but do you touch this "
A,Elicit,"or do you touch this ? "
A,Task,"I mean comm I I never touch between the buttons . "
C,Task,"I think both . "
B,Task,"I do . "
C,Task,"I do . "
B,Task,"Or the s uh the sideways . "
C,Minor,"I think "
B,Task,"Or the the back . Or the back . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm the side comm exactly comm the sideways . The side comm "
A,Elicit,"but do you touch between the the these buttons ? "
B,Minor,"I think "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"especially when there are l a few buttons on it comm you have uh a lot of space to touch . "
B,Task,"So you just have it in your hand completely "
B,Task,"or or i you play with it . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Well comm "
A,Task,"we do not have very much time uh left . "
A,Task,"Um I guess you two have to figure that out . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"I'm going to leave the decision to you comm "
A,Task,"um because you have to make its prototype comm "
A,Minor,"and um yeah "
A,Minor,"y "
A,Task,"you have the most knowledge about the suppliers comm the possibilities "
A,Minor,"and uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"so I'm going to leave it the decision with you . "
A,Elicit,"Um Sebastian comm did you write enough decisions down ? "
C,Task,"Um not quite . "
C,Elicit,"Um what about uh the chips ? "
C,Elicit,"We use the regular chip ? "
B,Task,"Regular . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And "
B,Minor,"Use with . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"no comm "
C,Task,"I think that's about it . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . "
A,Minor,"The chip is is not really "
C,Task,"The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . That's all . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well . "
C,Task,"And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"then I think we are uh quite finished . "
A,Task,"Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes "
A,Minor,"and um "
B,Minor,". "
B,Task,"For the finishing touch . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm um "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"if you write wrote anything down comm uh could you put it on the shared folder ? "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But um Sebastian has everything . "
A,Task,"I know comm "
A,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"well "
C,Other,"I'll put it online . "
A,Other,"Great . "
A,Other,"Right . "
