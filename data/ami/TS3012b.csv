A,Task,"Wait for the marketing director actually comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
A,Minor,"Anyways . Uh . See comm "
A,Elicit,"shall we wait ? "
A,Task,"I'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever comm "
A,Other,"so I'm gonna start soon comm "
A,Minor,"we have now "
A,Task,"don't have much time anyway . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"there he is . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"There you are comm "
C,Minor,"we "
D,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Minor,"okay . "
D,Task,"a little bit of pl little problem with computer . "
A,Other,"Uh no problem . "
A,Task,"We're about to start comm "
A,Task,"so have a seat . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"welcome again . "
A,Task,"Today comm functional design phase . "
D,Minor,". "
A,Other,"I'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"that was just to get to know each other comm "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project comm "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the the project share comm "
A,Task,"so if you wanna review them comm they're there . "
A,Other,"I will do so after every meeting comm "
A,Task,"so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there . "
A,Minor,"Anyways comm um "
A,Task,"today three presentations comm from every one of you . "
A,Task,"Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board comm "
A,Task,"so we're gonna go af go after over this later . "
A,Task,"But I wanna start with uh stuff you did first comm "
A,Task,"so we can see what everybody came up with . "
A,Task,"And after that we can have the new requirements "
A,Task,"and share some thoughts comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
A,Elicit,"Who would like wanna go first ? "
D,Other,"Yeah comm sure comm no problem . "
B,Task,"Go ahead . "
A,Task,"Take it . "
D,Task,"Um there was a little problem with my computer "
D,Task,"so not uh the whole uh presentation uh "
A,Other,"Anyway comm "
A,Task,"let's see what you have . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um Okay comm "
A,Task,"Uh it's still a bit open . "
D,Minor,"I want to open the my s "
D,Task,"oh no . "
A,Task,"You should close it on your own notebook comm I guess . "
A,Other,"Yeah . So there ? "
D,Task,"Oh no comm "
D,Task,"that's okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Uh slide show . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"The functional requirements comm it's uh uh very important for uh the user comm "
D,Minor,"he he wants to "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"The the method we used uh it it's not m not a slide comm "
D,Task,"because it went wrong comm "
D,Task,"but the method we use uh comm um we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men comm "
D,Task,"and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like "
D,Task,"and uh what what's uh important . Uh "
A,Elicit,"If I can cut in comm "
A,Elicit,"is it people or men ? "
D,Task,"People comm "
D,Other,"sorry . "
A,Other,"Is it people comm okay . "
D,Task,"Both women and men comm "
A,Task,"'Cause I thought it was only men comm "
A,Minor,"so "
D,Other,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . Uh "
A,Other,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"the findings um uh "
D,Task,"seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . Um "
B,Task,"That's pretty shocking uh . "
A,Task,"So we have to s we have to do something about that . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"and "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Minor,"most th th "
D,Task,"they want to spend money for a better system comm for better remote control comm "
D,Task,"so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it comm "
D,Task,"and um they use yeah comm they use zap a lot comm "
D,Minor,"um uh fifty percent say they only "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"that's the most important things . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Um oh yeah comm "
D,Task,"not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation comm "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"but um uh the relevant buttons are the power comm the channel selection and the volume selection . "
A,Task,"just talk ahead . "
D,Task,"It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Uh less important is tel teletext comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"uh um they use it comm "
D,Task,"but it's not uh very uh important "
D,Task,"uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh "
A,Minor,"Okay comm that's okay . "
D,Minor,"and "
D,Task,"but not important is the channel selection comm "
D,Minor,"the the "
D,Other,"hmm ? "
A,Task,"That's a little weird . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Minor,"the the "
B,Elicit,"Which channel selection ? "
D,Task,"no no no no no comm "
D,Task,"that's very important comm "
D,Task,"but uh w and not important in the audio settings comm display settings "
D,Minor,"and uh "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we can we can hide those under a menu or something comm "
B,Other,"Oh comm okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"okay . "
D,Task,"Um new preferences preferences . "
D,Task,"Uh um um beep to find your control comm "
D,Minor,"was "
D,Task,"that was in the test comm the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control comm "
A,Elicit,"That's like a button on your T_V_ ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Remote comm okay . "
D,Task,"so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . "
D,Task,"And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition "
D,Task,"um so they can say uh what they want to let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen "
D,Task,"um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it ? "
A,Task,"We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Is that manageable ? "
B,Task,"'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too . "
A,Minor,"That sounds too "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's possible comm "
A,Task,"but uh I think it's expensive comm "
A,Task,"but do continue . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Um "
D,Task,"Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel comm "
D,Minor,"so I can uh I dunno comm "
D,Task,"so I can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel "
D,Minor,"wh what I uh "
D,Task,"so comm the remote mu must see or um must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel comm "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"you don't set it yourself comm "
D,Minor,"so I can zap t to "
A,Task,"it just remembers the channel that you are on most comm for example . "
D,Other,"What ? "
A,Elicit,"You want the you want it to be programmed comm for example "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"y programmed f "
A,Elicit,"or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Recognise "
A,Minor,"Let's see comm "
A,Task,"you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so it recognises your favourite channel . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's uh what my personal preference like . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Minor,"it's it it does "
A,Elicit,"it recognise itself comm "
A,Elicit,"you don't have to set it "
D,Task,"No comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"itself . "
D,Task,"Maybe it's easier to to sell it comm "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I don't know it's manageable comm "
D,Task,"but we will uh we will see . "
A,Other,"I see . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"it's a little bit "
D,Task,"uh it's the end of it . "
D,Task,"It's a little bit uh I lost it comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"the computer uh crashed comm "
D,Minor,"so . "
A,Other,"No problem comm it's it's okay comm "
A,Minor,"that's "
B,Elicit,"Shall I go ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm go ahead . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"some technical functions . "
D,Other,"Darn computer . "
B,Task,"Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Uh let's just start with the method . "
B,Task,"It sounds really easy comm "
B,Elicit,"what does the user do comm what does the th remote control do comm "
B,Task,"but there are quite some issues . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Other,"the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect comm "
B,Task,"because the technical aspect comm that's pretty much covered . "
B,Task,"We can do that . "
B,Elicit,"What goes wrong at the user . "
B,Task,"Gets the remote control . "
B,Task,"Where is the remote control ? "
B,Task,"We've all had it once comm "
B,Task,"I want to watch some television comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"where's the remote control ? "
B,Task,"That was one of your ideas "
B,Task,"which you posted in the network folder comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That seems very good . "
B,Task,"a really good idea . "
B,Task,"Uh these are just the issues . "
B,Other,"I come to some uh personal experience comm findings comm possible solutions later . "
B,Task,"Searches for the button . "
B,Task,"There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . "
B,Task,"Uh so either we lose those "
B,Task,"or we try to make it a little bit more clear . "
D,Minor,"Mm uh . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . "
B,Task,"There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols comm "
B,Task,"because you don't know which channel is this button comm "
B,Task,"so possibly we could find uh something for that comm "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"have it more make it more durable actually . "
B,Task,"yes . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh covered that . "
B,Minor,"Oh yes comm "
B,Task,"user presses the button . "
B,Task,"Um usually when you have a lot of buttons comm buttons are small . "
B,Task,"So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that comm "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Minor,"the buttons should be "
B,Task,"so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . Yeah . "
B,Task,"And possibly also the size comm so more important buttons comm bigger "
A,Minor,"Wow . "
A,Minor,"The s "
A,Task,"Yeah . Make it make them bigger . "
B,Minor,"si "
A,Task,"Even more durable uh . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols comm locator comm a sound comm "
B,Minor,"uh so "
B,Task,"clear we should stick to existing symbols comm "
B,Task,"but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others . Uh "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"This I pretty much covered . "
B,Task,"So what we want to go to is not this one comm "
B,Task,"but more less buttons comm easy comm some bigger buttons . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's true . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"that's basically uh what I had in mind . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's clear . "
B,Task,"This is not the final design comm "
B,Task,"this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea . "
A,Other,"No comm of course uh "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I must say that it "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"that was it . "
A,Other,"That was it . Okay comm "
A,Other,"that was good . "
A,Task,"So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think it's a really good idea . "
A,Task,"and increase it the durability of of the thing comm "
A,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"The other aspects comm we'll just see how what you came up with "
A,Task,"and what's possible for that budget . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay comm that's fine . "
C,Minor,"Um . Okay comm now "
C,Other,"work a little with me . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Well comm "
C,Other,"let's start it as it is . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"uh the method . There are a few questions that need to be answered comm "
C,Task,"uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . "
C,Elicit,"Which buttons are wanted comm "
C,Elicit,"uh is our remote control universal "
C,Elicit,"or should it be programmable . "
C,Task,"Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . "
C,Task,"Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? "
C,Task,"I'll tell you why that's important to me . "
C,Task,"Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control comm "
C,Task,"so uh uh that's why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs comm "
C,Task,"uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens comm "
C,Task,"but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of comm it has to b to be built . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"it's "
A,Task,"Yeah . Of course comm hmm . "
C,Task,"that's not as easy as it s might look like . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh material study comm I'm working on that um for the the costs . "
C,Other,"I have to check out how far I can go with that . "
C,Task,"Normally comm a circuit board is made of fibreglass "
C,Task,"uh and the wires are made of copper . "
C,Task,"Uh that is how it is done "
C,Task,"and all the remote controls work that way comm "
C,Task,"I think we can just go on with that . "
C,Task,"Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . "
C,Task,"The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece comm uh that is cheaper . "
A,Elicit,"You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . "
C,Task,"Exactly comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it comm then that's cheaper . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"So we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again . "
A,Minor,"So you have "
C,Task,"This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button comm "
C,Task,"so this is not the entire thing . "
C,Task,"You have the the power coming in comm "
C,Task,"then you have like a switch . "
C,Task,"The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor comm that thinks over a Morse code comm "
C,Task,"that's how you should see it . "
C,Task,"The Morse code goes to the amplifier comm "
C,Task,"then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . "
C,Task,"You have infrared "
C,Minor,"and an interv "
C,Elicit,"um uh how to say it ? "
C,Task,"Uh a light in indication comm light that you know that it's functioning . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh here again comm that's my story about the different modes comm "
C,Task,"if you do want to make remote uh universal comm then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . "
C,Task,"That makes it much more complex comm "
C,Elicit,"so we really need to have a look comm do we want that or not . "
C,Task,"Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far comm "
C,Task,"except for uh the materials to be used uh light comm that they are light . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"That was it ? "
C,Task,"That was it . "
A,Other,"I'll get back to my thing then . "
A,Minor,"Uh Okay comm "
A,Task,"back this up to the screen . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I got some new information on the project specifications "
A,Task,"are changing a little . "
A,Task,"Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore "
A,Task,"because the uh the internet comm "
A,Task,"nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly comm "
A,Minor,"so it can either "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"I don't think we should remove the button comm "
A,Task,"because there are always people who are using it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But I don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example . "
A,Task,"Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . "
A,Task,"It's not important anymore . "
A,Task,"Um we're targeting young people now comm "
A,Minor,"because our um "
A,Task,"This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people comm "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Minor,"which are "
A,Task,"um the younger people were defined under forty . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"I so I think it's "
D,Minor,"B "
A,Task,"that's also good with the fashion and everything comm "
A,Minor,"so yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"and they want to pay for it "
D,Minor,"and uh "
A,Task,"They want to pay for it comm people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . "
D,Minor,"With more Where "
A,Task,"If they like the way it looks comm the way it functions comm so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it . "
D,Task,"with more technical specifications "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"in the "
A,Task,"see how far we can go with it anyway comm so "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable comm "
A,Task,"which is apparently black and yellow comm "
A,Minor,"but I'm not sure if we "
A,Task,"I think we should keep the the logo in mind comm "
A,Task,"because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it comm which suits everybody's taste . So "
A,Task,"With that concept I started thinking comm so why not just steal Nokia's idea "
A,Task,"and just make changeable covers for your "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"I mean those cost hardly anything I think comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover "
A,Task,"and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . "
A,Minor,"Or we can sh "
A,Task,"for example we can make a different a basic design . "
A,Task,"And sell the covers separately comm for example . "
A,Task,"That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied comm "
A,Minor,"so you can p "
A,Task,"it appeals to really everyone . "
A,Task,"So you don't have to I think you don't have to make entire remote controls . "
A,Task,"We make a basic one "
A,Task,"and manufacture this cover separately . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"just "
A,Elicit,"I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime comm after making a presentation . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Would you like to share ? "
C,Minor,"No comm "
C,Task,"I think this is a good idea . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"But "
D,Minor,"But oh ? "
B,Elicit,"Is it manageable ? Is it easy ? "
C,Task,"Go ahead . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"with with an L_C_D_ screen you can "
A,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
A,Task,"I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen comm "
C,Task,"Y Yes comm I think so too . "
A,Task,"like you said . "
D,Elicit,"Why ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think for example it's it's huge I think the L_C_D_ is huge comm "
D,Minor,"Nokia w "
A,Task,"it consumes batteries like hell . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . "
B,Task,"And it costs too much to fabricate comm "
A,Task,"It costs a lot comm I think . "
B,Task,"so we're on a tight budget here . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm uh "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"What we could do comm what could be possible comm is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview comm "
A,Task,"but y I'm not sure if it's even possible . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"For example comm a little T_V_ guide . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Like you have a little "
A,Task,"just just a text only comm not colour comm just a little text thing "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide . "
A,Elicit,"I'm not sure it's even possible comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Other,"I have to check that out comm "
A,Minor,"but maybe okay comm make it "
C,Task,"I'm not sure . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"find a little compromise in that comm "
A,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"What did I write down ? "
A,Task,"I think the p yeah comm the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement comm "
A,Task,"just make a button on your T_V_ "
C,Task,"That must be possible . "
A,Task,"and just hit the button comm it beeps somewhere . "
A,Task,"I think it's easy to implement comm "
C,Minor,"Ja . "
A,Task,"we should go for that . "
C,Minor,"I'm sorry comm "
C,Minor,"whe where do you wanna hit the T_ you wanna "
B,Minor,"And it's "
A,Task,"Uh speech recognition . "
C,Elicit,"we want a button on the television . "
A,Minor,"I thin "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"I mean where else should you put it ? "
C,Minor,"In th "
C,Other,"okay comm "
C,Task,"but that rules out a universal remote control . "
C,Task,"Because that's not possible uh . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"but how are you gonna use that if your "
A,Elicit,"I mean if your remote control is lost comm how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ? "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
B,Task,"Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal . "
A,Other,"A slap-on sticker . "
A,Other,"Oh comm "
A,Elicit,"you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_ . "
D,Minor,"Mm uh . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm exactly . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that could be possible . "
A,Task,"A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then comm okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Elicit,"then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not comm "
C,Task,"because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do . "
A,Task,"I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal comm "
C,Minor,"If not "
A,Task,"because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think universal remote control should be possible . "
D,Minor,"Um "
C,Other,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"Everyone uh wants to buy it comm "
C,Task,"then I go for that . "
D,Minor,"so we w "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think we're targeting everyone comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"so remote "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"No comm "
C,Task,"it's fine with me comm "
C,Task,"but then I know what to look for . "
A,Task,"Okay comm universal is good . "
A,Task,"Speech recognition comm I think it's very hard comm "
A,Task,"because we're selling across multiple countries . "
A,Task,"So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus comm it's very hard to do . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Or one . "
D,Task,"Or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough comm "
B,Minor,"And it's "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but I don't see Arabian people speaking one comm two uh whatever . "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Minor,"But "
D,Other,"Oh yeah . "
B,Task,"Besides that comm the technology isn't really super yet comm "
B,Task,"so that is a problem in implementing this . "
A,Minor,"It's "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's not a mature technology comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control comm "
B,Task,"It's a good idea comm "
A,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"but it's just not I don't think the market's ripe for that yet . "
A,Task,"I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"What else do we have ? "
A,Minor,"Um well "
A,Task,"you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So the the the symbols won't fade comm "
A,Task,"maybe a little harder plastic "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
C,Task,"I already noted that . "
A,Minor,"or especially li we don't "
A,Task,"maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons comm "
A,Task,"but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons comm "
C,Task,"Mm comm okay . Okay . "
A,Task,"so those always fade first . "
A,Task,"Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Let's see . "
C,Task,"If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers comm then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . "
C,Minor,"That's fo is "
A,Elicit,"For example ? "
C,Task,"uh especially for older people comm that they can read it read it in their own language . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"we're not we're not targeting older people comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"we should remember that . "
A,Task,"Everything we target is under forty comm "
C,Minor,"That's "
C,Other,"okay comm okay . "
A,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"You assume that that they read correctly "
A,Minor,"and I think they're "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Task,"The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world comm "
D,Minor,"But b "
C,Minor,"Uh okay . "
A,Minor,"so "
B,Elicit,"But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves "
B,Minor,"or just the "
A,Task,"No comm of course . No comm "
A,Task,"I think it's just something you you put over them comm "
A,Minor,"because "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah we c Yeah comm you ca Well comm "
D,Minor,"But every "
B,Minor,"C "
A,Minor,"tha that's not a that's not a bad that's not even "
B,Task,"that's a problem with the with the text then . "
A,Task,"it's not even a bad idea . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"I mean comm for example comm if you're if you're into the durability issue you could "
A,Task,"For example comm if your buttons are faded comm after I mean if you make a durable remote comm they are faded comm you can just buy a new cover . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve comm "
A,Task,"So it's a good and a bad idea . "
C,Task,"so you don't have to change your whole cover . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . "
C,Elicit,"Know what I mean ? "
D,Other,"Oh . "
B,Other,"Oh yeah comm I know what you mean . "
C,Task,"It works the same as a Nokia telephone comm "
C,Minor,"it's it's in my uh 'kay . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm I know comm "
A,Task,"it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
A,Minor,"okay . Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"that's what I "
A,Other,"something I have to look into . "
A,Elicit,"Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover comm "
A,Task,"I'm not sure which which is easier comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Minor,"Um anyway comm yeah comm "
A,Task,"this is what we're gonna do afterwards comm "
A,Task,"just lunch break and have more individual work after that comm "
A,Minor,"so let's see what we let's see we "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"you have to come up with a components concept comm "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"I want some "
A,Task,"you should do some trend-watching comm "
A,Task,"because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything comm what people really want comm that's what we need to know in this phase comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think user interface is fairly obvious . "
A,Task,"I mean it should be very intuitive comm "
B,Task,"Pretty straightforward . "
A,Minor,"s "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"it should speak for itself . "
A,Task,"Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ comm "
A,Task,"it was it l it's like all buttons "
A,Task,"and you have no idea what it does at first comm "
A,Task,"and I'm total T_V_ new comm anyway . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I think it should be have less or l very little buttons "
A,Task,"and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . "
A,Task,"Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu comm "
A,Task,"like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever comm they're more complicated comm "
A,Task,"just stick 'em under one menu "
A,Minor,"and uh give it a "
A,Task,"just put it in in s in a software piece comm "
A,Task,"you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"because we're working with different types of television comm "
B,Elicit,"so we're going to work with that ? "
A,Task,"That is true . "
C,Task,"I don't think so . "
A,Task,"No comm that's true . "
C,Task,"No comm I don't think so . "
C,Task,"Because the television needs to respond to the signal comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
B,Task,"It's an in-built menu comm "
C,Minor,"and if it doesn't know how comm it's "
B,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Exactly comm "
C,Task,"that's not possible . "
B,Minor,"So basically "
B,Minor,"we "
A,Task,"I'm not sure if it's impossible comm "
A,Task,"but uh there's a chance it's not comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
B,Task,"Or we could use a double-sided for less used functions "
B,Minor,"you "
A,Other,"A double-sided remote control ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I don't think that's useful . "
B,Task,"with the cover . "
B,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"it's basically an idea to overcome these issues comm "
B,Minor,"because "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons . "
A,Task,"For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a Sony that won't for a Philips T_V_ . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Minor,"but basic functions "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but functions which are not frequently used . "
B,Task,"Because if we use a universal remote control comm we're going to have to have most buttons on it comm "
A,Task,"I don't think we should "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"for exam "
B,Minor,"so "
D,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
A,Minor,"I'm not s "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Minor,"for ex "
A,Elicit,"you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s comm not not the very complicated settings "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . "
C,Task,"But that might be broken . "
A,Task,"I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands . Especially the big ones comm the big brands comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"so . "
A,Minor,"'Cause everybody "
A,Task,"I have a universal remote control "
A,Task,"and it can use the menu button comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"so I think "
A,Task,"I'm not sure comm "
A,Task,"if you can put some research into that comm if it's possible . "
A,Minor,"Uh I think just a b "
C,Task,"Mm okay . "
A,Task,"and the navigation is very basic comm "
C,Task,"Mm . But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . "
A,Task,"it's usually the same thing . "
C,Task,"For instance comm if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours comm then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm that's true . I think so "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our "
A,Task,"uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu comm "
A,Task,"I think it's possible comm "
C,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"just the way how to . "
C,Task,"I thi I think so too . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"then then you could do everything I suppose comm "
A,Task,"because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software comm "
A,Task,"so it's okay . "
C,Task,"And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . "
C,Task,"For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and you always grab the wrong one "
C,Task,"because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same comm only the labels are different . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else comm "
C,Task,"We should not do that . "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
A,Minor,"because it's either it's both mayb "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I have some ideas . I have some ideas . "
A,Task,"maybe the shape can be a little different . "
A,Task,"Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever . "
D,Minor,"Um yeah . "
C,Task,"Mm that's your uh division . "
D,Task,"And uh with different colours uh . "
A,Minor,"So um "
B,Other,"I'll put some on paper "
B,Other,"and present them next time uh the ideas that I have . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"this . "
A,Minor,"Not sure what "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"because we have forty minutes comm "
A,Task,"I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
B,Task,"I heard a beep go . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but it wasn't me comm "
A,Task,"it was him closing something . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So anyway comm yeah comm "
A,Task,"we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . "
A,Elicit,"I mean what do you want comm "
A,Minor,"do you want comm but "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but we like some some curves "
B,Minor,"or "
A,Other,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"may maybe something like this . "
A,Task,"But though smooth inside . "
A,Task,"So you have the transmitter here for example . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Let's see that you what would be handy . "
D,Task,"Uh . And a light uh "
A,Task,"I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own . "
A,Minor,"Let's see "
A,Other,"one comm two "
A,Other,"God damn it . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"we get the general ideas comm yes . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Other,"Another one here . "
A,Minor,"Let's see what "
A,Minor,"I think this should "
A,Task,"these are always on top of the of the control comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"so they should be here . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"and since you're holding it like this comm I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume "
A,Task,"Think it's like this . "
D,Minor,"Volume . "
A,Minor,"Withi within the "
B,Minor,"yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"just take it . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"you have the up channel the down channel "
B,Elicit,"the volume comm do we want that horizontal or vertical ? "
A,Elicit,"Do you take triangles "
A,Minor,"or "
D,Task,"Uh it's it's fine comm I think . "
A,Minor,"Um I think it should be I think it "
B,Task,"This is basically what people are accustomed to comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but this is just a g general idea . "
D,Minor,"Oh d "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm in the middle . "
A,Task,"It's it's usually uh there comm "
A,Minor,"but "
B,Other,"Whoa . "
A,Other,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it comm if you if it's lost comm for people that are deaf . "
C,Task,"They they won't hear the the beep . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but for example if it's lost in your armchair comm we'll not see the flash . "
B,Task,"You won't be able to find it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And flash takes up a lot of batteries again . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's true comm "
C,Task,"but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost . "
D,Minor,"Just "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up . "
C,Minor,"So . "
D,Task,"And L_E_D_ uh on it . "
C,Minor,"deaf people ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I thought about for deaf people for example comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"We could do that . "
D,Task,"Just a light on it "
A,Minor,"Uh let's see . "
D,Minor,"or "
B,Task,"So we have the basic channels we've got here comm "
B,Elicit,"uh the power button somewhere over here ? "
A,Other,"Oh yeah comm it's true . "
A,Task,"Um that thing should be central . "
D,Task,"Very important . "
A,Minor,"You shouldn't be "
A,Task,"you uh shouldn't press it by accident comm "
A,Task,"but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"I usually press it on top . "
D,Minor,"that's "
D,Minor,"It's "
B,Task,"At least that's what I'm accustomed to . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I have another idea comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"like that's gonna work . "
C,Task,"I'm not sure if it's possible . "
D,Minor,"And "
B,Minor,"What would you like to ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I thought maybe we should move the buttons down "
D,Minor,"But you r "
A,Task,"and put it here for example "
D,Minor,"And you are reading from the t "
A,Minor,"to "
D,Task,"you always read from the top to the the bottom of it . "
A,Task,"From top to bottom . Yeah comm that's true comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"so it's "
A,Minor,"you should "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I think the bu the power button should be on top comm "
A,Task,"'cause it's the first thing you do comm turn it on . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So power button on top . Um "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Elicit,"mute button . Is that somewhere here ? "
A,Other,"Mute . "
A,Minor,"Do we hardly "
A,Task,"I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . "
B,Elicit,"Is that used often ? "
D,Minor,"So i it's "
D,Other,"sorry ? "
B,Elicit,"The mute button ? Do people use that often ? "
A,Task,"Mute . Turn the sound off . "
D,Minor,"No comm it's no . "
B,Task,"'Cause uh I'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here comm at least in general comm "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"I don't think it's important comm "
B,Task,"It's not that important comm no . "
A,Minor,"but I think it I think it should be you c "
A,Task,"you could put it somewhere here . "
D,Task,"Or or with the volume selection . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"because it "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"people are accustomed to that comm "
D,Task,"Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection . "
A,Minor,"it's "
A,Task,"Can I have that ? "
D,Task,"I don't know where exactly comm "
B,Task,"Sure . "
A,Minor,"That's j "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Other,"Take this out and here see "
A,Elicit,"Uh are we gonna take triangles anyway ? "
A,Task,"I'm drawing triangles comm "
A,Task,"but "
B,Task,"That's pretty much what people are accustomed to comm "
B,Elicit,"aren't they ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . "
A,Minor,"So anyway comm "
A,Task,"I think this is should be the channels "
A,Minor,"and or sh "
D,Minor,"Wha "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I'm accustomed to the channels being on top . "
D,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm me too . "
A,Task,"Here comm "
A,Task,"okay . Okay comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's better . "
D,Task,"On the right . "
A,Minor,"should we chan "
A,Minor,"okay comm "
A,Task,"this two comm channel up and down . "
C,Elicit,"Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? "
C,Task,"That you don't have to buy new batteries if every "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Minor,"for that is it's "
A,Task,"on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it "
D,Task,"Maybe it's more ex expensive . "
C,Minor,"Mm comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Maybe we should what "
A,Task,"what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Minor,"You have "
A,Task,"just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable comm "
C,Task,"But that's already possible . "
A,Task,"because it's an it's it's it's very annoying . "
B,Elicit,"But isn't that expensive in the entire package ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive comm "
A,Task,"but just take a look at it comm "
A,Task,"because it might be a very good idea . "
A,Task,"Because if it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable comm "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"but at the same time comm if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now comm you wanna be able to put different batteries in it comm use it now and not in half an hour . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Uh "
C,Task,"you could make a device comm "
C,Task,"but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs comm that you can put in normal batteries comm rechargeable comm "
C,Minor,"but it you're "
A,Task,"I think I have a nice idea . "
C,Task,"the remote also can act as a recharger . "
C,Task,"So then you can choose comm you have every decision . "
C,Elicit,"Know what I mean ? "
A,Other,"Not exactly uh . "
C,Task,"You can uh put in normal Penlites comm rechargeable Penlites comm "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"but they can also be recharged with the remote comm with a wire . "
D,Other,"Yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea "
C,Minor,"So but "
A,Task,"to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat comm you could insert your uh remote into it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"that's g "
C,Task,"But I think that will cost a lot . "
C,Task,"Uh a normal wire would be better . "
A,Task,"I'm not sure . "
C,Task,"Like a like a P_D_A_ comm a hand-held . You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself comm "
A,Other,"A what ? "
C,Task,"you don't need basic station . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"or "
A,Task,"So you could put that on a T_V_ for example . "
C,Task,"That is possible comm that's true . "
A,Task,"It could be very flat comm "
D,Minor,"But Which "
A,Task,"could be very small . "
A,Minor,"It's a very small "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I'm drawing it big now comm "
A,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"So you can put your remote on flat for example . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"for example um you just put it down comm it recharges for example . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I don't think it's very expensive . "
B,Elicit,"But again comm isn't that too expensive ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries comm a docking station "
A,Task,"I'm not sure if it costs a lot comm "
A,Minor,"that that's what he r "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"That's that you "
A,Task,"that's what you buy yourself . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Other,"I'm going to try to find that out . "
C,Task,"I'm not sure if there's information available on this comm "
A,Task,"It's just an idea comm "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"we have to find out if it's possible . "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Elicit,"And do people actually want that ? To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm they want to pay for it . "
A,Minor,"Do they want "
A,Elicit,"but they want a rechargeable one ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I'm not sure comm "
A,Task,"you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important . "
D,Minor,"Th uh there was not a el ask esque "
C,Task,"Hmm . These are uh comfort issues . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"So I think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"this is comfort . "
A,Task,"They want to pay for comfort comm "
A,Minor,"we just assu we "
A,Task,"we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it comm "
D,Minor,"But f "
D,Minor,"hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"um and Yeah comm "
A,Task,"we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Exactly . "
C,Task,"I think this is a brilliant product . "
C,Task,"I would buy it myself . "
A,Task,"I think it would be good actually . "
A,Task,"I like the beep part anyway . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Minor,"let's go through the "
C,Task,"I like the covers . That's a brilliant idea . "
B,Elicit,"Can can we save this or "
C,Minor,"I never thought "
A,Task,"Covers is covers is good . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"it's "
A,Minor,"Oh "
A,Task,"we can save this . "
A,Task,"Up and saved . "
A,Task,"We even saved the ant . "
A,Minor,"Um Okay . So "
A,Minor,"what we have is you have "
A,Task,"I think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost . "
C,Other,"I hope if I have information about that comm "
A,Minor,"Maybe "
C,Minor,"I'm gonna "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We are going for twenty five Euros sales price comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it comm "
D,Other,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"because if they're willing to pay more comm we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . Yeah . "
A,Task,"uh we just have to see what it looks like . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"I would like to make a decision . What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"if you have some financial information that that'd be nice comm "
C,Minor,"and "
C,Task,"exactly comm I need it . "
A,Minor,"so . Hmm . "
B,Task,"Could you post some other essentials of what people want comm "
B,Task,"so that I can work with some buttons comm where to put it "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You seem to have information on that comm "
B,Task,"I'd like to uh see some of it . "
C,Elicit,"Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ? "
A,Minor,"No comm it wasn't wasn't allo "
B,Task,"No comm it's not . No . "
C,Minor,"Not . "
A,Task,"it was possible comm "
A,Task,"not allowed comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"So that's um why I'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"My computer crashed comm "
D,Minor,"so uh "
C,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"I don't care . "
D,Task,"I lost my uh presentation comm "
A,Task,"I haven't heard any complaints yet comm "
B,Other,"Oh comm your computer . Okay . "
A,Minor,"so . Um "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"I have the uh "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I have your PowerPoint presentation comm "
B,Task,"I can get some inf information out of that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"but I "
D,Task,"Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our internet comm "
B,Other,"Let's see . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"the oh comm they inc uh "
D,Minor,"and here is my "
A,Task,"they include the new one . Or just for you . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Minor,"where would we "
D,Task,"here is my marketing report comm "
D,Task,"maybe you ca you can look at uh that "
A,Minor,"Oh "
A,Task,"no comm I didn't have that . "
D,Minor,"and "
B,Elicit,"Where would we want the uh teletext button ? "
D,Other,"Ah yeah . "
B,Task,"Because we decided that it's n not that important . "
D,Minor,"And one "
A,Minor,"All it tells just let's make make a new "
B,Elicit,"Do we put it somewhere over here ? "
A,Task,"tick the new one . "
A,Task,"Um other side . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"let's increase it a little "
A,Minor,"because "
D,Minor,"And uh wha what people want comm I've uh "
B,Task,"Or maybe this is something for the next meeting comm "
B,Other,"I can draw out some ideas . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"draw us up some some designs of of possible "
D,Task,"I have another thing uh "
A,Task,"just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"so the more less important "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"we have decided more or less the basic structure . "
A,Task,"More or less . "
B,Other,"I can put the other buttons in "
A,Task,"Just play a little with this comm "
A,Minor,"put l "
A,Task,"shift a little up or down "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and we'll see what looks best . "
C,Elicit,"What uh what did you wanna say ? "
A,Task,"Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Um "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh what I al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost comm "
B,Minor,"Maybe another idea uh . "
D,Task,"but it it's also for people comm they want to learn it fast comm "
D,Minor,"not uh they want to "
C,Other,"Mm . Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm so "
A,Task,"we don't want we want very little buttons comm just the buttons you use a lot . "
D,Minor,"No "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"It's "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"it's easy to learn "
B,Minor,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"but it should cover all the functions comm "
D,Minor,"wi and uh "
B,Minor,"so possibly comm just an idea that popped in "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"what "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"we had function that what people do comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"People change channels comm "
A,Task,"people they change the volume "
A,Task,"and they they change channel comm "
A,Task,"they turn T_V_ off and on comm for example . "
A,Minor,"That's the basic fu "
A,Task,"that's what you do "
A,Task,"I'm not sure who present that again comm "
A,Task,"but those are the basic function that people use it for comm "
A,Task,"so those should be very well represented . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"And The If "
B,Task,"but we could go a step further comm "
B,Task,"because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness comm that kind of menus . "
A,Task,"That's true comm "
A,Task,"but that's what we stick under the menu button . "
A,Minor,"Everything is "
A,Task,"you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu . "
B,Minor,"Yes comm "
B,Minor,"but it "
C,Task,"But that's the question comm "
B,Minor,"Because we're making "
C,Task,"is it ? "
D,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but "
C,Task,"If it isn't comm then we cannot reach it . "
B,Task,"We need to adjust to the technology . "
A,Task,"But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu . "
C,Task,"I think so too . I think so too . "
B,Task,"True . "
C,Elicit,"Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that comm so we know that for sure ? "
C,Task,"If you rule out functions comm then uh and that gets known comm then people are not gonna buy it . "
C,Task,"Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it . "
B,Minor,"No comm I thi "
D,Minor,"If um "
C,Task,"That's a bad bad com commercial "
A,Task,"Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with . "
C,Minor,"for "
D,Task,"Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty . "
C,Minor,"okay . "
A,Minor,"Under forty . Yeah ? "
C,Task,"That's true . "
D,Task,"Um on my report comm I didn't uh ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"because my computer crashed . "
A,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"The want to pay for "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"Oh . "
C,Elicit,"Did they really said it like that ? Those two things . "
D,Minor,"i "
D,Task,"yeah . Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"and "
C,Elicit,"Do they realise how much that costs ? "
A,Elicit,"Uh shall we ? "
C,Task,"That's almost undoable . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Oh comm we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then comm with an L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Task,"Younger comm age sixteen and forty five . "
D,Minor,"Uh but "
A,Task,"That's all here comm "
A,Minor,"here it says "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"that's that's . "
C,Task,"Even if i if we have this lost unit comm then we cannot do it for that price . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . "
D,Minor,"If if they "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"we're not focusing on this . "
A,Minor,"Um All the interest in features comm not really the L_C_ "
A,Minor,"oh "
A,Task,"here . "
A,Task,"Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . "
A,Other,"Hmm comm okay ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
D,Minor,"So uh "
D,Minor,"we can "
A,Minor,"Speech recognition is quite "
D,Task,"We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ "
D,Minor,"and uh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm just look at the possibilities then comm "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"because if "
A,Task,"apparently it's what people want comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"How much it will cost "
A,Task,"it's supposed to be a luxurious remote comm "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"maybe it's not even that expensive . "
A,Task,"Or find a compromise comm "
A,Task,"maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it comm on your programmes . "
C,Minor,"Uh I "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"I doubt it comm "
B,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"But I really need finance information . "
A,Task,"Me too . "
A,Task,"I mean we all do . "
C,Task,"We all do . "
D,Minor,"It will come uh "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"I think it's something we should put into consideration . "
A,Task,"Apparently it's what people want comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"We should see if what it costs comm if it's possible . "
C,Task,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
A,Task,"we should do a little thing about design comm "
A,Task,"because it looks boring really to me . "
A,Task,"Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it comm it looks still looks boring comm "
D,Elicit,"Different colours maybe . "
A,Minor,"so . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"And the design comm it should differ . "
D,Minor,"But all "
C,Task,"This is Philips comm "
C,Elicit,"huh ? "
C,Task,"Philips has this . "
A,Task,"I have no clue . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily . "
B,Minor,"I had basically "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"Something like this . To make it kind of futuristic . "
C,Minor,"Mm . Oh comm "
C,Task,"I realise if we make it small comm then it needs to be a little thicker comm "
A,Minor,"I think it's a very "
C,Task,"because I need to put all the electronics in it . "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
C,Task,"If we make it s uh smaller comm uh less wide comm then we need to m make it a little thicker comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"because I have to put all the electronics in it . "
A,Other,"Okay . Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I mean we can stick it in in there comm I think . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"Huh "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"what kind of "
A,Minor,"even if "
A,Minor,"in the worst case we can even "
A,Task,"Could you give me the pen back ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . "
A,Task,"Let's take take the basic design again comm what we oh comm crap uh came up with . "
A,Other,"I'll just make it a little bigger now . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"a transmitter here . "
A,Task,"Anyway . "
A,Minor,"We could "
A,Task,"let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen comm "
A,Task,"people want an L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Task,"So then we should probably put it here . "
A,Task,"It doesn't have to be really big comm "
A,Task,"but just just have to be has to be there . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Think it's a good place comm "
A,Minor,"people don't "
D,Task,"If you're reading from top to bottom comm I think it's better to put it uh at the top . "
A,Other,"No ? "
A,Task,"It's not that uh it's not the most important function comm "
C,Task,"Me too . "
D,Minor,"It's j "
A,Task,"it's just an extra thing comm "
C,Minor,"Ah "
A,Minor,"it just "
D,Task,"Uh . But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it comm I think it's very important to use it comm "
A,Task,"you press the buttons on top comm "
C,Minor,"but . "
A,Task,"because your finger is on top . "
D,Minor,"uh because it's use it uh "
A,Elicit,"How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ? "
D,Minor,"But nee the function of it . "
D,Task,"So you can use it maximum comm "
D,Task,"because uh it's a lot it costs a lot . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"but why "
A,Task,"I I'm not sure . "
B,Task,"Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand . "
A,Task,"Uh if you t if you press a button comm you can see it comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . No . "
A,Minor,"ri "
A,Minor,"I'm not sure wha "
A,Task,"I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like . "
C,Minor,"M "
C,Task,"I personally would prefer it on the top . "
B,Minor,"I'm "
A,Other,"You would prefer it "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"n "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Task,"So we have three people saying it should be on top . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"But it "
A,Task,"but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Anyways . "
D,Task,"It's expensive to build it comm "
D,Minor,"so "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Uh this looks a little "
D,Task,"you must use the maximum of it . "
B,Task,"I'm still not convinced of the "
A,Elicit,"About the L_C_D_s thing . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"if it if it's "
A,Task,"if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive comm we should include it comm "
C,Task,"They want it uh . "
A,Task,"because it's it's cool . "
C,Task,"We should just try to make that if it's possible . If it is possible we should really do it comm "
C,Task,"but we need that information . "
D,Minor,"Huh . Uh . But uh "
C,Task,"Also keep in mind again comm the L_C_D_ screen is very flat comm "
C,Task,"but it needs transistors comm resistors comm I don't know what more "
C,Task,"and that needs space . "
C,Other,"So I have to look if that's possible . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm I know uh . "
C,Minor,"But if we "
B,Minor,"So basically "
B,Minor,"can I "
A,Task,"Uh we have green now uh "
B,Task,"what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . "
B,Elicit,"Do we put the volume control and the channel control here comm "
B,Minor,"or do we put it on he "
B,Elicit,"Would we like to press it in the middle ? "
D,Task,"In middle of it . "
A,Task,"Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom . "
D,Task,"In the middle . "
A,Task,"Maybe in a circle for example comm like we like in this example . "
A,Task,"I think this is not good comm "
A,Minor,"but for "
A,Task,"we could make circular buttons for example . For up and down comm ma make it a circle on it comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yes comm "
B,Elicit,"but we do agree that we keep this at the centre comm "
A,Minor,"because it "
B,Task,"because it's basically the most important function . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think the channel button should be in the centre . "
D,Task,"It's the most import yeah . "
A,Task,"Channel button should be st stick together comm for example here in this section . "
A,Minor,"Because it's uh "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"that would make them quite small . "
A,Task,"We're not sure about the size anyway comm "
B,Task,"So maybe you'd put them here . "
A,Task,"just a general design . "
A,Task,"You can make it as big as you want . "
A,Minor,"For example if you take uh "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"but a big remote control probably not something which people would like . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"let's see . "
A,Minor,"For example just "
C,Task,"If we have a a space issue comm we can also lose one battery . "
C,Task,"It is rechargeable comm "
C,Task,"so we can stick with one instead of two . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That might be an option . "
A,Task,"I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen comm we need to comm definitely . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen comm that means a lot of space that we need . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but we have to see what the si what the size is . "
C,Task,"But it has to be a little bit heavier . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"but the things behind it . space . "
A,Minor,"Mm let's see . "
C,Other,"Like a process uh . "
D,Task,"Finish meeting now . "
D,Task,"It's on your computer . "
A,Other,"Finish meeting now . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we will . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"would we like this "
A,Minor,"So either "
B,Minor,"or would we like the "
A,Task,"We either we have to decide what what people want . "
C,Task,"I like this one more . "
A,Elicit,"Either this one comm "
A,Task,"this this could be the luxurious one . "
A,Task,"So we have channel buttons here . "
A,Task,"I'm just drawing something uh . Uh "
A,Task,"I think this would this would look cool . "
A,Task,"You could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions comm "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"so if your basic function's here comm we should like we decided before comm programmes up and down comm and volume here . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Other,"Let's see what we have here . "
D,Minor,"Or "
D,Elicit,"And uh what about speech recognition uh "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"you can just "
A,Task,"no comm I'm not sure if we can do that comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
A,Task,"but we could put a microphone in here for example . "
D,Minor,"but or "
D,Task,"or an L_C_D_ or an uh speech . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I think it's L_C_D_ is better now . "
A,Task,"Just to do research into both comm w what it costs and what it takes for space . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I'll try to . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But let's cut the meeting for now yes . "
C,Other,"One more uh thing I'd like to say comm "
C,Task,"uh let's give this uh a name comm and not like some vague serial number that no one understands comm like with cars . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"Shall we all try uh to think about a name ? "
B,Minor,"So I think of a name . "
D,Minor,"that's "
D,Task,"yeah comm that's okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm let's think of a name comm okay . "
A,Other,"Uh okay . "
D,Other,"Oh comm good . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm at anyways comm "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly comm "
A,Task,"so there we go uh . "
B,Minor,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"go and finish up "
B,Other,"and I'll see you at lunch . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Good luck . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm to all . "
D,Other,"Same . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm I've "
C,Elicit,"Do we uh save the ? "
D,Minor,". "
D,Minor,". "
