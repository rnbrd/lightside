A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Here we go . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm "
A,Minor,"the agenda for thi "
A,Other,"oh . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . "
A,Task,"And then we will evaluate it comm given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . "
A,Task,"And um talk about our finances comm whether we were under or over our budget . "
A,Task,"I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made comm given our options . "
A,Task,"And um evaluate the product comm as a group . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"And um "
A,Task,"So first we'll have the prototype presentation . "
A,Elicit,"Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ? "
B,Task,"Um yeah . "
B,Task,"I just got a few slides comm so show them . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Elicit,"Do you want to present it ? "
C,Minor,"Um "
B,Other,"Yeah comm here we are . "
C,Task,"This is what we came up with . "
C,Task,"It's a pretty simple design . "
C,Elicit,"It's um based on a mango ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And we "
A,Other,"On ? "
B,Task,"Mango shape . "
A,Other,"A mango . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And we have the company logo here "
C,Task,"and this will be the infrared here "
B,Task,"The L_E_D_ . "
C,Task,"and this'll be the power point comm the on off button kind "
A,Task,"Oh . Okay . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Other,"I'm sorry . "
D,Minor,"What was the "
D,Other,"where's the L_E_D_ ? "
A,Other,"Oops . "
C,Task,"It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . "
D,Task,"Oh . Okay . "
C,Task,"And then the other one is the power . "
C,Task,"And uh we just have a simple design . "
C,Task,"We wanted it all to be "
B,Task,"So it's palm-held . "
C,Task,"accessible from your thumb "
C,Task,"yeah palm-held "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and all the "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"buttons are accessible from your thumb . "
A,Task,"Notice you have a number ten button . "
C,Minor,"So you don't have to "
C,Task,"Oh that was a mistake comm "
C,Elicit,"wasn't it ? "
C,Task,"Right no comm that's a zero . "
B,Task,"You just need the nought . "
C,Other,"Take that one off . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Task,"I was in charge of the numbers . "
A,Task,"No problem . "
A,Other,"Ah . "
C,Task,"And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . "
B,Task,"So one plus one would be eleven comm "
C,Task,"You can go one comm three or something . "
B,Minor,"or "
A,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"You press that first and then you go one three "
A,Elicit,"You press a plus button ? "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Oh okay . "
A,Task,"I've never heard of that kind before . "
C,Task,"Well we just thought comm we have all the numbers here comm so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and "
B,Task,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"because if you "
B,Task,"on your average um remote comm if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve comm you press one comm and then you go to channel one comm and then two then you'd just go to channel two comm instead of twelve . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Oh comm "
D,Minor,"there's no e "
D,Task,"okay . "
B,Task,"So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve comm or two plus two is channel twenty two . "
C,Minor,"So the plus and then "
A,Other,"Oh . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"I "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Elicit,"Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? "
C,Task,"No no comm "
C,Minor,"th all "
C,Task,"that's why we have all these numbers . "
C,Minor,"These numbers um "
C,Task,"these numbers all work independently up to nine . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"but I mean if you press comm it'll go to that channel right away . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . "
C,Task,"Oh no . "
C,Task,"Uh comm the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . "
A,Task,"Yeah I know comm "
A,Elicit,"but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five comm channel sixty five comm if I press the six it'll go to channel six comm and then I'll press the plus comm and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ? "
D,Task,"Sixty . "
C,Minor,"You p "
C,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"No you press the plus first . "
C,Minor,"I I well it doesn't "
B,Other,"Oh . "
C,Minor,"we haven't really s "
C,Task,"I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five comm "
C,Task,"but she says plus press which "
B,Task,"Well I don't mind comm "
B,Task,"we can further define that . "
C,Elicit,"what do you think is simpler ? "
A,Minor,"I th "
C,Minor,"It's a "
A,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first comm in like on the way to channel sixty five . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But I was just wondering "
B,Task,"But I suppose it's not as snappy . "
A,Task,"like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . "
D,Task,"Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think . "
C,Other,"Oops . "
D,Minor,"Where you can have it "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"it's like a five second input time . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"If you don't put it "
D,Task,"So as long as you hit them dada "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"that "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"it should be fine . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"Was there "
D,Elicit,"so on the top there is volume and "
B,Task,"And channel comm "
C,Task,"A channel . "
B,Task,"which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it comm like "
D,Other,"Channel up volume up . "
D,Task,"Okay cool . "
A,Other,"C_ and V_ . "
C,Task,"Just so we can flick "
A,Task,"Right comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"where um where's the power button ? "
C,Task,"It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . "
B,Task,"It's the bigger R_ . "
D,Task,"It's the R_ . "
A,Other,"Oh okay . "
B,Task,"So it's just like . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"We deci "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers "
B,Task,"because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . "
A,Task,"Oh okay . "
B,Task,"Uh e ergonomics are all considered . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . "
A,Task,"Ergonomic comm definitely ergonomic . "
B,Task,"It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But yeah "
B,Task,"comm no I mean it's a different movement "
B,Task,"so yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um and the feel of it comm I mean comm we've made this out of Play Doh comm which is representing the comm you know comm the rubber comm and the spongy rubberness . "
A,Minor,"The spon yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls "
B,Task,"so this has got a you know a bit of give to it comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and it just feels feels different . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Bit of a stress ball feel . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Would you like to feel it yourselves ? "
A,Other,"Yes . I would . "
B,Task,"How it fits in the palm of your hand ? "
A,Other,"My goodness . "
A,Other,"There you go . "
B,Other,"Thanks . "
B,Task,"And you ? "
D,Other,"Yes "
A,Other,"Genevieve ? "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Task,". Oh it's nice . "
D,Task,"Oh I think I killed the five . "
D,Task,"I did . "
D,Task,"I killed the four . "
A,Minor,"And something hmm . "
D,Other,"Oh god . "
B,Minor,"O "
B,Task,"Okay comm as for the colours comm we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . "
D,Task,"Oh it smells good . "
C,Task,"Of Play Doh yeah . "
B,Task,"But we're thinking that comm seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway comm "
B,Task,"that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . "
B,Task,"Or the combination . "
B,Task,"Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme comm the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit comm "
B,Task,"like banana could be black and yellow comm watermelon red and green comm "
A,Task,"Oh right . "
B,Task,"or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in "
C,Task,"'Cause it'd be quite subtle and "
B,Task,"more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"It looks more "
A,Task,"Think like vanilla and banana would . "
B,Task,"Banana's more representative of our colour scheme comm like the company the yellow and black . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay yeah . "
B,Task,"So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . "
B,Task,"I mean watermelon comm you know comm m probably appealing to the "
A,Task,"Kinda Christmas comm you know . "
B,Task,"yeah comm seasonal . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Apple green comm brown comm more kinda trendy comm you know comm khaki "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of comm "
C,Task,"and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . "
A,Task,"Cool . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . Um yeah "
B,Task,"we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device comm "
B,Task,"I mean you don't need to use both hands comm one hand to hold this and type in with the other comm you can just use your thumb . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ "
B,Task,"and that's about it . "
A,Task,"Alright comm "
A,Other,"thank you very much . "
A,Task,"Good work everyone . "
D,Other,"Bravo "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"And so now that we've we have a prototype comm uh we need to go over the finances "
A,Task,"and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So comm I have "
A,Minor,"something I'm going to "
D,Minor,"You want the "
A,Other,"Oh wait a minute . "
A,Elicit,"Do you need to do a presentation first ? "
D,Task,"I don't know what order it goes in . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"I'm gonna check that out for a second . "
D,Task,"I have one . "
B,Minor,"Mm go "
A,Minor,"What time is it anyw "
A,Task,"Oh yeah "
A,Other,"sorry "
A,Task,"you're right . "
D,Task,"Evaluation cri Okay . "
A,Task,"Evaluation criteria is next in line . "
D,Task,"That's me . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Hello . "
D,Other,"Oh there we go . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Come on my computer . Come on . "
D,Other,"Sorry "
D,Task,"my computer's giving me technical difficulties . "
A,Task,"Just press um function eight again . "
D,Elicit,"Should I press it again ? "
D,Minor,"Last time I did that it sh "
D,Task,"Okay . You're right . "
A,Task,"And then again I think . "
A,Task,"One more time . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Elicit,"Still not there . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay now I think for this one I could "
D,Elicit,"Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard "
D,Other,"or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . "
D,Task,"Um comm we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . "
D,Task,"Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings comm um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were comm "
D,Task,"um comm back to our kick-off meeting this morning . "
D,Task,"Um comm and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . "
D,Task,"Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . "
D,Task,"So basically the lower p the lower the points the better . "
D,Task,"Okay so question number one . "
D,Minor,"Does the remote "
D,Other,"whoops . "
D,Other,"Sorry . "
D,Task,"Oh I'm not gonna be able "
D,Other,"um comm I'll do it on the whiteboard . "
D,Task,"I can't change it "
D,Task,"so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"I'll write down our scores up on the "
A,Other,"Ooh . "
D,Task,"Okay so number one . "
D,Elicit,"Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Feel I think . "
B,Task,"We've been quite successful with the rubber coating "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"The look is a little bit more playful . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy comm "
D,Task,"but it's definitely different . "
D,Minor,"It's not your traditional "
A,Task,"Oh definitely different yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"I think the colour has a lot to do with it . "
B,Task,"I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek "
A,Elicit,"Oh you were only given red and black ? "
B,Task,"red comm black and yellow comm and orange . "
A,Other,"Oh okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah so "
C,Task,"not very sleek "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So we want it to be stand out that way comm anyway . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"A metallic-y finish we were thinking . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Well I know know it's for rubber . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Polished . "
B,Task,"I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . "
C,Minor,"Okay "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I kinda I like the potato look . "
A,Task,"It's mango . "
D,Task,"It's very different . "
B,Task,"Oh well comm potato comm mango comm fruit and veg . "
C,Minor,"We we were we were thinking about "
D,Other,"It's what ? "
A,Task,"It's mango . "
D,Other,"Oh sorry "
D,Other,"the mango the mango look . "
B,Task,"Potato's fine . Potato's fine . "
D,Task,"Yeah it is comm fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Totally . "
B,Task,"It's really adaptable . "
D,Task,"So I myself would say a one or a two . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I would say two . Personally . "
C,Task,"I w I'd say two I think . "
D,Elicit,"It's a two ? "
D,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Elicit,"For the "
D,Minor,"and p "
C,Task,"Fanciness . "
B,Other,"fancy "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"One being true . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"I uh two comm "
D,Other,"Two . "
B,Task,"three . "
D,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing comm like that . "
D,Elicit,"Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? "
D,Task,"So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"and the use of the rubber . "
D,Task,"Use of the rubber comm the use of the L_E_D_ . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"For the anti-R_S_I_ . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative "
D,Minor,"Isn't "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"and we don't have any scroll buttons comm it's all pushbuttons comm "
B,Task,"there's no L_C_D_ control comm "
B,Task,"so if we're thinking about the rest of the market comm it's sort of probably halfway . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"In some aspects it is comm like we said . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I'd say maybe three . "
C,Task,"I'll go for three as well . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And I think I mean it it's tough to say "
D,Minor,"because we were "
D,Task,"we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this comm because then that would've defeated the purpose . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Though it was our specification . "
C,Task,"No . Wouldn't be simple comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah we want it simple . "
D,Minor,"So I mean I "
D,Task,"we'll put three comm "
D,Task,"but I think we actually reached our goal . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"We didn't want it any more than that . "
D,Task,"Okay question number three . "
D,Elicit,"Uh comm will it be easy to use ? "
A,Task,"I think so . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah very . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . S "
C,Task,"I think one for that . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"I think it's "
A,Task,"Yeah . One . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"you can't really get confused with that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"I mean comm there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system . "
A,Minor,"Th "
A,Other,"The plus number thing . "
C,Task,"Yeah that's the only thing yeah . "
D,Task,"But once that's figured out comm it should be fine . "
B,Task,"Yeah and perhaps the turning on "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"Number four . "
D,Elicit,"Is this a good-looking remote ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . "
B,Task,"Again I think the colour comes into this . "
C,Minor,"It's definitely "
A,Task,"Yeah colour will definitely be a factor . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I think that the logo could be smaller . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And maybe not such a prominent way . "
C,Minor,"But the "
A,Task,"Maybe like at the bottom comm kind of . "
C,Task,"Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . "
B,Minor,"Not in "
D,Other,"Whoops . "
A,Task,"Oh it just had to be on there I guess . "
D,Task,"Should just not touch it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Don't worry . "
D,Task,"This time it's the three I killed . "
D,Task,"I was just wondering if it should be like flatter . "
D,Minor,"Or "
B,Task,"I suppose I've got quite big hands . "
A,Task,"I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . "
D,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But you know what I've just thought of there now . "
C,Minor,"What "
C,Elicit,"where's it gonna sit in your living room ? "
C,Elicit,"Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? "
A,Task,"Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat comm "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . "
A,Task,"and then the rest is like "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand . "
A,Task,"round . "
D,Task,"Oh . That's true . "
A,Task,"It would still be comfortable I think . "
B,Task,"Thing is like that comm it's not going anywhere particularly . "
A,Task,"We c we could handle it I think . "
D,Task,"Maybe comm it could it could be on the bottom comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"so you wouldn't loo "
D,Task,"like if it's flat here comm so it sits up . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Like that . "
C,Task,"Oh that would be nice . "
A,Task,"Ah it'd fall over all the time though . "
A,Task,"It'd be annoying . "
B,Task,"Uh yeah comm "
B,Minor,"it's less um comm what's th ha . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I g "
D,Task,"If it's weighted maybe . "
B,Task,"H it's got higher centre of gravity like that . "
D,Other,"Details comm details . "
A,Task,"'Kay we're done designing . "
D,Elicit,"Okay . So comm is this a good-looking remote ? "
A,Other,"Come on . "
D,Elicit,"Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? "
C,Task,"Three . "
C,Task,"You would though comm 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think comm it was another colour and it was like I think it'd look okay . "
A,Task,"I think maybe a two . "
D,Task,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"I mean I gue yeah comm it's personal taste comm "
B,Task,"I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that comm "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but definitely in another colour comm "
B,Task,"I'm not happy with those colours . "
D,Elicit,"Okay comm so should we say two for that ? "
A,Task,"Sure . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Uh comm question number five . "
D,Minor,"What's um "
D,Elicit,"will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? "
D,Task,"Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . "
C,Task,"I think we have to market it in the right way comm that um to say that it is simplistic . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So people don't just see it and think comm uh comm this is so simplistic comm I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We have to market it . "
D,Task,"Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And the kinetic energy comm shaker-style-y comm whoo comm "
C,Task,"And the kinetic energy part . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"ooh no . "
D,Other,"Shake it and the buttons fall off . "
A,Other,"Durable . "
C,Task,"Don't shake "
B,Task,"But you know comm those'll be firmly on . "
C,Other,"Oh no the plus . "
C,Minor,"You're "
D,Task,"No comm I guess comm I don't know much about the remote control industry comm how much your average sells for comm "
C,Task,"use the zero . "
C,Task,"Make a new one . "
A,Other,"But you're our Marketing Expert . "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Other,"I know I am comm aren't I ? "
C,Task,"I think they're about ten po ten pound comm "
C,Elicit,"aren't they ? "
C,Task,"About ten pounds . "
D,Task,"But you don't have to buy batteries . "
C,Elicit,"Fifteen ? "
D,Task,"So in the long term this can actually save you money . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm comm yeah comm that's true . "
A,Task,"Oh . Exactly . Exactly . "
D,Task,"So we'll market it that way too . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Good point . "
D,Task,"So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options comm it'll "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I would give it a two still though . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Okay number six . "
D,Task,"Can someone read it out ? "
D,Minor,"Or "
B,Elicit,"Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um yeah . "
D,Task,"So that was mainly that the statistics "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think it does very well . "
A,Other,"Oh yeah . "
B,Minor,"Because "
D,Minor,"we said "
B,Task,"yeah comm "
B,Task,"because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . "
C,Task,"The zap "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And it's just you won't have to think about it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"You don't have to look down to find them . "
B,Task,"They're clearly there comm "
B,Task,"easy to use . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"Simple . "
D,Task,"I guess the I think the key word there is average comm "
C,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But they're not you and I really . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"So . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Okay so one ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Number seven . "
D,Task,"C Heather could you push it down ? "
D,Elicit,"Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? "
D,Task,"Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . "
D,Minor,"Now is there the "
A,Task,"We have the alarm system . "
D,Elicit,"is the alarm system still was it implemented ? "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"the bu "
C,Task,"when you press the alarm system comm the lights behind the and it'll vibra "
B,Minor,"It "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"l lights on and comm or flash as well . "
B,Task,"But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . "
C,Task,"It'll be again in the marketing . "
A,Task,"I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"The light it will . "
A,Elicit,"Or or was it gonna make a noise ? "
C,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But when the alarm's not "
B,Task,"yeah "
C,Minor,"But both "
B,Minor,". If you "
A,Task,"You press the button it makes a noise "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"It turns into a duck and starts quacking . "
B,Minor,"You could s "
A,Task,"Yeah . Awesome . Awesome . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Here I am . "
C,Task,"Oh comm that would be brilliant . "
C,Minor,"I'd be tempted to "
B,Task,"Well the thing is comm if it was had an alarm system comm "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"I mean comm when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something comm there wouldn't be any point . "
B,Task,"So you can't see the alarm comm but it would light up . "
C,Task,"It would have to be in the market "
A,Task,"I though w it was gonna make a noise . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Alarm comm "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"but you still couldn't see it . "
B,Task,"but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself . "
C,Task,"It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"We "
D,Other,"oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah . "
D,Task,"But yeah comm it'll be there . "
D,Minor,"So we can we could say that "
A,Other,"Oh okay . "
A,Other,"Whoo . Okay . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
D,Task,"We can give it a one comm "
D,Task,"because compared to every other remote ever m ever made comm this one will be easier to find . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm totally . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . Um "
B,Other,"Sorry Heather . "
B,Task,"That wasn't very clear . "
A,Other,"No problem comm mm . "
D,Task,"Question number eight . "
D,Elicit,"Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? "
D,Task,"Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . "
D,Minor,"So it has to be "
A,Task,"Totally . "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . "
C,Task,"So the plu the plus "
D,Task,"The plus thing needs to be worked on . "
C,Task,"w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
C,Elicit,"won't it ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"I think "
B,Task,"just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons comm I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . "
D,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Do "
D,Elicit,"Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? "
D,Task,"So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"so it's just like channel six comm six comm enter . "
C,Task,"That kind of annoys me though comm when it's zero six when you have to press "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I don't know why . "
A,Task,"Yeah but you don't have to press zeros . "
D,Task,"You could just press six enter comm "
C,Other,"Oh okay . Right . "
B,Task,"And or sixty six enter comm y "
D,Task,"or one two enter . "
A,Task,"And then like twelve comm enter . "
C,Task,"Alright comm aye . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Good "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um comm okay so we can "
C,Task,"I'd say w yeah one . "
D,Elicit,"we'll say yes it's uh one ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Ooh . Mm . "
D,Task,"Question number nine . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
D,Elicit,"Uh comm will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ comm "
D,Task,"which was repeated strain injury ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Injury . "
D,Task,"Um comm which affected over a quarter of users . "
D,Minor,"S "
C,Other,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"I think so . "
A,Minor,"It's like right in the "
C,Task,"But if you're zapping "
A,Task,"Your thumb might get a little bit uh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's what I was thinking . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"I don't think it will f "
B,Task,"We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"the biology . "
A,Task,"But it is soft . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"It's soft comm "
A,Task,"And that's kind of what the um "
D,Minor,"and "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"And people could "
A,Task,"the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"so maybe it is but "
D,Task,"I don't know what other options there are . "
B,Minor,"I think we're getting "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"that's true . "
D,Minor,"Could "
D,Task,"I mean comm you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . "
D,Task,"But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So comm I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So comm one or two do you think ? "
C,Task,"I I'd say t "
B,Minor,"I think "
B,Task,"yeah comm I think too . "
C,Task,"two . Yeah "
D,Task,"Two okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay number ten . "
D,Elicit,"Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? "
A,Elicit,"Yes we did . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? "
D,Minor,"Is the yellow "
C,Task,"N We we can't really do that "
C,Task,"because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"It won't stand out . "
C,Task,"So n it's not always gonna be the same colour . "
D,Minor,"It sounds like the colour's something that we "
A,Task,"Well comm yeah the colours are yellow and grey . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Gray comm yeah . "
A,Task,"So it could be grey on the banana one . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm could be grey . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though comm "
D,Minor,"depending on the "
C,Task,"Yeah that's right comm "
C,Minor,"we didn't even rea "
D,Task,"So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers comm and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think this is the "
B,Task,"the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Perhaps a metallic "
A,Task,"Mm comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"or or "
C,Task,"like that's grey comm and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . "
C,Elicit,"No ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That isn't rubber . "
D,Task,"And the buttons in the middle . "
D,Minor,"Okay "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So comm do you think that's more of a three then ? "
D,Elicit,"Three comm four ? "
B,Task,"Four I think . "
D,Other,"Four ? "
B,Minor,"Well I don't "
B,Minor,"what do what "
D,Task,"Well we have good reasons for it comm "
A,Minor,"Hum . "
D,Task,"so we but we can still put a "
D,Task,"a four ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"and final question . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? "
D,Task,"Current trends of fruits and veggies comm desire for sponginess . "
A,Task,"I would say so . "
C,Task,"Following that briefing we did . "
A,Task,"But maybe more like two "
A,Task,"'cause there's no like pictures of fruit comm it's just sort of naming it by a fruit . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"With the with the colours . "
B,Task,"Like um the colour scheme names and stuff . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"No comm uh comm are the plates interchangeable ? "
D,Minor,"I think I missed a few "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"they are ? "
D,Elicit,"So you can have banana and kiwi and "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay comm so that's something that's kind of in the making too comm "
D,Minor,"like maybe it'll become more "
A,Task,"That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"It is . "
C,Minor,"I think "
C,Task,"w yeah comm "
C,Task,"I think one . "
C,Task,"Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . "
C,Task,"Well we haven't got a big banana but "
B,Task,"The thing is comm I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from comm I don't know if you'd instantly say mango . "
C,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
A,Minor,"Be like "
C,Minor,"No . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"No . "
A,Other,"Maybe if it was scented . "
B,Other,"Oh yeah . There we go . "
C,Task,"Oh that would be class . "
B,Task,"That would be great . "
A,Other,"Yeah we have money for that . Um "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"Alright so based on this evaluation comm do we average them out sorta thing ? "
D,Task,"Yes we do . "
D,Elicit,"So I wh what was I gonna put for that ? "
D,Elicit,"A two for fashion ? "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"I would say two . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Two . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay comm so our average there comm five comm six comm eight comm ten comm eleven comm twelve comm thirteen comm fifteen comm nineteen comm twenty one comm divided by eleven "
C,Minor,"It's "
D,Minor,"is "
A,Task,"One point nine or something ? "
B,Minor,"It's "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I don't know these things . "
B,Task,"Between one and two . "
A,Task,"Um comm between one and two . "
D,Minor,"Between "
D,Task,"okay . "
B,Task,"So that's pretty fantastic . "
C,Task,"Close to two . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . "
C,Minor,"I got "
A,Task,"Alright . "
D,Elicit,"Does that seem right then ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm 'cause we've a four to bring down . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"It seems like it should be more around two . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm aye . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh comm should've added five . "
B,Elicit,"Do we have an online calculator ? "
A,Other,"I'm attempting to do that right now . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"This is . "
A,Task,"Yeah it is one point nine . "
A,Other,"Ooh . "
C,Task,"Yay . "
B,Task,"Oh wow . Well done . "
A,Other,"Go Heather Pauls . "
B,Task,"Well that's excellent . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Alright comm now with that over and done with comm our next step is to see if we are under budget . "
A,Task,"And um my computer's frozen . "
A,Task,"And now it's not . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
A,Task,"um in our shared folder comm "
A,Task,"if everyone could go there right now comm um "
D,Other,"Sorry . "
A,Other,"I'm going to um steal a cable . "
D,Elicit,"Are you gonna do that ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um it's it's um "
C,Elicit,"Is that the project document ? "
A,Task,"it's an Excel file . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"Production costs . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"'Kay there we go . "
A,Task,"Um comm production costs . "
A,Other,"And um I have to access that as well . "
B,Minor,"It says it "
A,Task,"One moment . "
A,Minor,"'Kay so far I've added what I think "
A,Other,"or what is going on ? "
A,Task,"Great . "
A,Task,"It's blinking at me . "
A,Task,"It's locked for editing . "
A,Task,"Read only . "
A,Other,"I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . "
A,Task,"I have the original in my um my email account . "
D,Elicit,"Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it ? "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now . "
D,Minor,"Or "
D,Minor,"okay . "
B,Elicit,"Have you have you completed it ? "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Oh right . Okay . "
A,Task,"No comm I was hoping that you guys could . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Um comm there we go . "
A,Task,"Okay here we go . "
A,Task,"So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . "
A,Task,"So um if you can look up at the screen comm "
A,Task,"um the large screen comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . "
A,Task,"Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Oh right . "
A,Task,"Um we're using a regular chip . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um comm it's cur it's double curved comm so its curved all around . "
B,Task,"Double "
B,Task,"double-curved yeah . "
A,Task,"That's another three . "
A,Task,"We're already at five . "
A,Task,"Um comm we're using plastic and rubber comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"Good thing plastic is free comm "
A,Task,"we're at eight . Um "
C,Elicit,"What about a special colour ? "
A,Minor,"S "
C,Elicit,"Are we using that ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I guess we should do it just for one kind . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well one colour for the case comm one colour for the buttons . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So we can "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um comm we have push button interface comm so that's inexpensive . "
A,Task,"And um we have a special colour for the button comm and we also have a special form . "
A,Task,"And a special material . "
C,Task,"And a special material . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Oof . "
A,Task,"Which puts us just barely under budget . "
A,Task,"Hurray . "
B,Other,"Congratulations guys . "
D,Task,"Mm . 'S good . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Good work guys . "
A,Task,"So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros . "
C,Task,"That's good . "
A,Task,"Awesome . "
A,Task,"And back to our PowerPoint . "
A,Minor,"So we've "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Other,"Yes we are . "
A,Task,"So we need to do a product evaluation comm again comm "
A,Task,"which is probably um "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"A different extension of a "
B,Elicit,"Of the actual project rather than the product ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
B,Elicit,"A project ? "
B,Minor,"Is is "
B,Elicit,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership comm teamwork . "
B,Other,"So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Alright so um "
A,Elicit,"Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ? "
B,Task,"I think we were pushed . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Pushed for creativity ? "
B,Task,"I mean we weren't really given a lot of time comm or materials comm yeah comm to go about our design task . "
C,Minor,"The ma "
C,Task,"Or materials . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So I think we could've done with a bit more time . "
A,Task,"Ye Okay . "
A,Task,"So it'd be like need more time and materials . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But you were allowed m creativity ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"and the conceptual and functional . "
D,Task,"Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess comm but m "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well we were just limited by resources really "
D,Task,"When we can down to it . "
B,Task,"and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen comm and like solar power backup and everything comm then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"So that did limit "
C,Task,"Creativity . "
B,Task,"creativity . "
A,Minor,"Right "
B,Task,"Just resources . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay "
B,Task,"But yeah . "
B,Elicit,"The fruit and veg idea . "
A,Task,"Great . "
A,Elicit,"Leadership ? "
A,Other,"Is this me being like comm guys do you like me ? Um . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Good leadership comm I think we stayed on task . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah we did . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"We've comm uh "
B,Task,"seeing as we've come out with what we intended . "
B,Task,"A pro um a product within the budget . "
B,Task,"I think that's a sign of good leadership "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and also our personal coach helped us along the way comm "
B,Other,"so you know "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And the timing was good . "
B,Task,"I think it's been fine . "
D,Task,"We never were pushed for time comm or sat around doing nothing comm so "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Good timing . "
A,Other,"Oop "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"And project manager of course . "
A,Elicit,"Teamwork ? "
A,Task,"I think we worked great as a team . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Was good teamwork . "
D,Task,"I think we are well-suited to our roles . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Alright how were our means ? "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"We needed more Play Doh colours . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah and more Play Doh comm "
B,Task,"'cause that was all the red we had . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype comm we wouldn't have been able to . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it c it might've been bigger . "
D,Other,"Oh really ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"But ever everything else was satisfactory ? "
A,Elicit,"Is that good "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The computer programmes are good . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"The "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It could be really straightforward for the computer . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I don't think there was anything "
B,Task,"I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but I think I was the only one who struggled with that . "
C,Task,"I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations . "
A,Other,"Yeah ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"They'll probably still be there . "
B,Minor,"Uh me too . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"New ideas found . "
A,Task,"I don't really know what that means . "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other comm "
B,Minor,"like the n um "
C,Task,"Yeah . Through discussion . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Just about each different . Got new ideas from each other . "
D,Other,"I'm not sure comm new ideas found . "
A,Other,"Hmm ? "
D,Task,"Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other comm "
D,Task,"which was cool . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah comm worked well . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And we were a able to modify each other's ideas "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"to fit in with our areas of expertise . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Each other's "
D,Elicit,"Oh does it have smart materials by the way ? "
B,Other,"Sorry ? "
D,Elicit,"Does it have smart materials ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Other,"Oh yeah . "
D,Other,"Oh yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Well mm comm did it come into the into "
C,Minor,"If if it if it "
B,Task,"I dunno if we counted that in the costs . "
C,Task,"If it can be afforded . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Task,"Well with that achieved comm our last slide is our closing slide . "
A,Task,"Yes our costs are within budget . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"It's evaluated generally positively . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . "
A,Task,"Then we celebrate "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Task,"Yay . "
B,Task,"Fantastic . "
A,Task,"in such a way that I have no idea . "
D,Other,"By watching T_V_ ? "
B,Task,"Okay comm brilliant . "
A,Elicit,"Alright ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Thank you very much . "
A,Other,"Okay comm bye . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Conclusion ? Dadada . "
