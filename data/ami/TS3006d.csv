A,Other,"Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs comm "
D,Minor,". "
A,Task,"because that's going to influence our design . "
B,Task,"Oh no . "
D,Task,"Oh comm . "
A,Minor,"If you "
A,Elicit,"Don't know if you al already had a look or not ? "
C,Elicit,"Did you do your questionnaire already ? "
B,Task,"No n I I already did it . "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"It's not much . "
B,Task,"It's just one question . "
A,Task,"Because we have a problem . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
D,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"If you look closely comm you can see . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"It wants "
A,Task,"Um I already took the liberty to make some suggestions . "
A,Minor,". "
A,Minor,". "
A,Task,"At the moment we have fifteen buttons comm one L_C_D_ screen comm one advanced chip-on-print . "
A,Task,"We use a uh sensor comm that's for the speech . "
A,Task,"Uh we use kinetic energy . "
A,Task,"And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? "
A,Task,"The special colour of the buttons ? "
B,Task,"No that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look . So "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah but everything is . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Should we switch to a hand dynamo ? "
A,Task,"Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things . "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm b but "
D,Task,"Yeah but young people like that . "
D,Task,"So just do normal battery . "
A,Task,"Batteries ? "
A,Task,"Batteries . "
B,Task,"I think the battery option . "
C,Task,"Just a normal battery then comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,". "
D,Elicit,"It has to be twelve and a half . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Or not ? "
B,Other,"Oh . "
C,Other,"Oh my goodness . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"You're going to redesign something . "
B,Task,"Oh no . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so we're at twenty five . "
D,Minor,"Uh comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? "
C,Task,"Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . "
C,Task,"I mean we have to drop on everything . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved comm but from the side it's it's flat comm "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Minor,"and the screen screen is just "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Well you just have to hold it like this then . So "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"How about "
A,Minor,"Um "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
A,Task,"Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine comm so you can't directly access a channel comm but instead use only the up and down arrows . "
C,Task,"That's what I was thinking . "
A,Task,"That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Let's do it then . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"A a "
A,Minor,"Uh then we have left "
D,Minor,"we "
B,Task,"But we don't have any basic options any more . "
A,Task,"Uh yeah . We do . "
C,Task,"And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well . "
D,Task,"F_ eight . "
A,Task,"They don't need special colours . "
A,Task,"Fine . That's more like it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"You were saying something . "
C,Task,"That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons comm and just make one "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen comm and select a channel comm click "
A,Task,"Yeah comm some more menu options . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . "
A,Minor,"But um "
A,Other,"Now let's look . "
B,Task,"Yeah we c could "
B,Task,"We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . "
B,Task,"Everything you can do with with the menu . So With the display . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"we need one integrated button for everything then . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The joystick . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Kind of . "
C,Minor,"I was Because "
A,Minor,"Uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm scroll-wheel comm push-button uh "
D,Task,"Integrated scroll-wheel push-button comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"If you if you go to "
C,Task,"If you go to our uh view comm "
C,Task,"like you if you are in the sound system there comm uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"this is just uh an example comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound comm "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"So you wanna click on it comm activate it comm whe and when you move it comm hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So that's kind of on your mouse "
D,Task,"and then you can click it comm adjust it comm click again and then you're out of it . "
D,Minor,"But you still "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
D,Minor,"But you then still need to have "
D,Task,"Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . "
D,Minor,"But you still um "
C,Task,"Yeah it's r Yeah . "
D,Task,"You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back . "
B,Minor,"So you do one inte "
B,Task,"You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And then just drop all the other buttons . "
A,Task,"Uh yeah . "
D,Task,"Well not all . "
D,Task,"Not s not sound I guess . "
B,Task,"But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons . "
C,Other,"No . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"It's uh "
A,Task,"One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"So we have to to make it s uh more uh It has to be "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"You could also drop j three more of these comm without losing much functionality . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You just drop the Okay and the Back . "
D,Minor,"Wh wh what what what is the "
D,Elicit,"what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ? "
A,Task,"Oh comm that's for the speech . "
D,Elicit,"Speech recognition . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Could drop the speech recognition . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"S s Drop speech recognition ? "
C,Minor,"No but "
A,Task,"Yeah that's possible . "
B,Minor,"We we d "
C,Task,"Yeah it's it's expensive comm but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . "
C,Task,"'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons . "
A,Task,"Buttons . "
D,Minor,"Buttons . "
A,Task,"That's not very easy to use . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I "
D,Minor,"No comm it can be disturbed by by noise and "
C,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works . "
D,Task,"stuff like that . "
D,Other,"Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . "
D,Task,"I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"I have to look on that . Let me see . "
D,Task,"Uh well no I was wrong . "
D,Task,"There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen comm we need a lot of "
D,Minor,"But if it "
D,Minor,"But it it it's a it's a both a hypers "
B,Task,"We lose our whole concept . "
B,Minor,"Uh so No we just "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We need a lot of extra buttons . "
D,Minor,"No comm but "
B,Task,"We keep the L_C_D_ . "
D,Task,"Well we Yeah we keep the screen . "
D,Task,"I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent comm uh sixty six to seventy six . "
C,Task,"We uh we we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system comm "
A,Task,"Okay "
A,Task,"so we drop the speech . "
C,Task,"so we can might as well s drop that . "
A,Elicit,"And drop it yeah ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . Let's drop the speech . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"S Fo Four less Euros . "
D,Task,"Sixteen Euros . "
A,Task,"So we still have three and a half Euro to lose . "
C,Task,"We need to lose some buttons . "
D,Minor,"But y y "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"if you lose the the Back comm the Okay button Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows comm and the Menu button . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Then you're "
D,Minor,"And then and then use um "
A,Task,"Oh and the power button we have also . "
D,Minor,"The the "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And the menu button does also does the okay function then . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"And then when you in the menu "
A,Task,"So that's one Euro . "
D,Minor,"S so so you activate the menu . "
B,Task,"If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons comm we can drop all the the push-buttons . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . "
A,Minor,"And "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"With the other comm we can do the the channel comm the volume comm et cetera . "
D,Task,"Yeah . . "
A,Task,"That would save zero point two Euros compared to "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No it's three Euros . "
B,Elicit,"No ? Um "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"No it's it's n Yeah . "
A,Task,"To This together is more expensive than Oof comm it's almost the same as t keeping this . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"Well okay . "
A,Task,"And we can drop these two . "
D,Task,"For example if you have f f four buttons comm channel up and down comm uh volume left right "
B,Minor,"It's the "
A,Minor,"Volume . "
D,Task,"Okay comm I've I think we have to keep that . "
A,Task,"And the power button . "
D,Minor,"And then "
D,Task,"and the power button . So that's five . "
A,Task,"That's the basic . "
D,Task,"That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . "
D,Task,"And then for the menu comm um you can have a button that activates menu . "
D,Task,"Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . "
D,Task,"And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel comm the the the menu gets activated comm "
D,Task,"and then you can scroll comm choose an option comm click on it comm it goes into an feature . "
D,Task,"Click on it again comm selects features comm scroll comm adjust it . "
D,Task,"Click again comm it's okay . "
D,Task,"Then you only need one button to move back . "
D,Task,"Or or under each option comm you set a you set an a screen thing what says back comm and you select that one comm click again comm and you go one step back . "
D,Task,"And in that menu comm scroll comm click comm one step back . "
D,Task,"So that then you need five buttons comm and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Which That's even "
D,Task,"But we can't drop three buttons . "
A,Minor,"Okay th that's "
D,Minor,"But I see that's "
A,Task,"Yeah that's one Euro more expensive . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So that's not a good idea . "
A,Task,"That's not an option . "
D,Elicit,"Because which buttons do we have now ? "
D,Task,"Those five which I mentioned comm and then menu comm and then "
A,Task,"Menu comm power . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"F of the four things ? "
A,Task,"Four arrows ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"th power . "
A,Task,"Power . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Elicit,"Which more ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm if you if you go to eight "
C,Task,"I don't know how to "
A,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
A,Task,"So four arrows ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh power I believe ? "
D,Minor,"Power . "
D,Task,"Th Yeah that's five . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"We have a Back and a Okay button . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay that's seven comm "
A,Task,"And the Menu . "
D,Task,"and one to activate the menu comm yeah . "
D,Task,"So okay that's eight . "
D,Task,"Well we can't reduce that . "
D,Task,"We we keep the display . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm well okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm and even if we drop three buttons from here comm we still have to make some adjustments around here . So "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display . "
A,Task,"The L_C_D_ ? Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Let's make the "
D,Task,"Yeah well we need the advanced "
B,Task,"Let's make the case plastic . "
D,Minor,"Instead of r "
A,Task,"Then I rather make it wood . "
A,Task,"Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah but but that's not our market . "
C,Minor,"True . "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"No that maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway . "
D,Task,"Ah no comm hard plastic . "
B,Task,"Plastic with a with a special colour . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"A woo wood uh wood uh wood colour . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm plastic with special colour . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"That's an option . "
A,Task,"Yeah okay uh "
D,Minor,"No but I I "
D,Task,"Because we have to use the special colour anyway . "
D,Task,"You forgot that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yep . Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"So let's go for the plastic . "
B,Minor,"So we do one one s "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . Plastic . "
D,Task,"And since it's not kinetic comm it doesn't have to flip around that much ? "
A,Task,"Uh that's easy because plastic is free . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"We still have problem of two Euros . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh if we dropped uh "
B,Task,"No the buttons comm those are really needed . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Yeah we can't drop them . "
B,Minor,"Yeah th th it's it's uh "
B,Task,"An advanced chip-on-print . "
C,Task,"Yeah uh "
A,Task,"You still need that . "
C,Minor,"You uh uh "
D,Elicit,"Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker comm and Which can use a regular chip comm wh which is six Euros in total . "
A,Minor,"S "
C,Elicit,"That doesn't matter . "
D,Task,"Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display . "
A,Minor,"No comm I keep the re "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So "
C,Task,"Well yeah . "
D,Task,"So the only option is an hand dynamo . "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
B,Task,"Oh that "
A,Task,"Yeah and something else . "
D,Task,"Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro comm right . "
C,Minor,"Yeah but the "
C,Elicit,"uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button "
C,Task,"? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already . "
C,Minor,"And then if w "
D,Task,"And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . "
A,Minor,"No y you would rec "
D,Task,"I mean it's not that important comm easy to use comm but "
A,Minor,"Then you have "
C,Task,"Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want comm huh ? "
A,Task,"Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . "
C,Minor,"And uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"For the volume . "
C,Task,"Yeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power . "
A,Task,"You can use those Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But the "
A,Task,"Oh yeah and power . "
A,Task,"That's three buttons and this would cost "
C,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now . "
B,Elicit,"But the integrated uh button ? How many func functions can it uh have ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Three . Up comm down comm Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah endlessly . "
C,Task,"I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"You can go into you in you main menu comm "
D,Task,"You you press it for like three seconds . "
C,Task,"you can choose uh flip channel comm uh you can choose sound options comm any options . "
D,Task,"Then then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . It would save enough "
C,Task,"Maybe we should . "
C,Task,"'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen . "
A,Task,"Yeah you can choose this comm drop these comm then we have a half Euro left . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So we can maybe still use power button . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but we'd Alright . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I guess we have to . "
D,Task,"It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half . "
D,Other,"So let's see comm "
D,Task,"we we drop the price by one and a half . "
C,Minor,"We'll we'll be on "
A,Task,"Yeah . You see ? "
D,Task,"But we still have thirteen left . "
A,Elicit,"Oh still Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah . "
D,Task,"Thirteen . So still half . "
A,Other,"Shit . "
D,Task,"There goes the special co "
A,Task,"Drop the special colour . "
B,Task,"Oh no . "
D,Task,"Well That would make it less appealing . So that's no option . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"What else ? "
A,Task,"Uncurved ? "
B,Task,"No no comm it has to be um curved . "
D,Elicit,"We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah it says right here . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"They made it very easy for us . "
D,Task,"Well yeah . yeah . "
D,Task,"We made it hard for ourselves with the display comm but it's a cool feature . "
A,Task,"Ah comm I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say comm this is better for the market so you sell more than "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Wh what we could do is um "
B,Task,"drop the the special colour comm and uh do the special colour for the buttons . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Buttons . "
A,Minor,"That's "
A,Task,"Oh yeah since we only have one button . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour ? "
A,Minor,"I just m I don't I think "
B,Task,"Just something else than than black or white I think . "
A,Task,"Uh yeah it's I think it's grey comm regular . "
D,Task,"S yeah . Alright . "
A,Task,"Grey and rubber . "
C,Task,"But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . "
A,Task,"Of plastic . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So I rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour . "
C,Other,"Damn . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"and then "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"You can still play with it then I guess . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . So I guess that isn't an option . "
B,Task,"The display "
C,Task,"Well comm you only have to power it up when you wanna use it . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"The "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But if you have to power the for ten minutes comm then the "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"No I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving comm no . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,". "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah true . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then . "
A,Task,"Yeah hand dynamo ? "
A,Elicit,"Do you want an extra button ? "
D,Minor,"Or or do we "
D,Task,"Or do we do uncurved and flat ? Instead of "
B,Task,"No no it has to be curved . "
D,Task,"Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Just put a special special colour of the buttons comm or something . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And a screen . "
C,Task,"Yeah . That's the most import "
A,Elicit,"Yep ? "
A,Elicit,"Instead of an additional power button ? "
B,Task,"Yeah or spe special form ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"S what what is special f "
D,Task,"Oh yeah comm special form . "
A,Minor,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Maybe that's nicer . "
A,Elicit,"It's for scroll "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But we don't have any buttons . "
A,Minor,"Without "
D,Minor,"So do "
C,Minor,"We only have "
D,Task,"d Uh make it a special colour then . "
B,Task,"Yeah . But it's it's for the integrated button comm I think also . Or "
D,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"Yeah but "
D,Task,"ma make it a special colour then . "
A,Task,"Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So "
B,Task,"Yeah . Okay . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Woah we're within budget . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's a miracle . "
B,Minor,"Oh just "
D,Task,"Let's let's save it . "
B,Task,"oh ma make it two special colours comm but we only have one button . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Let's do it like this comm "
D,Task,"I mean comm because it does not lose our identity of the product as we "
A,Task,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um comm well "
A,Task,". 'Kay comm this was old . "
C,Task,"Well we come back to the drawing board then comm huh ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah back to work "
D,Task,"Yeah all your designs are uh pretty much "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Unlab,". "
C,Task,"It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . "
A,Other,"Did I save it ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah but that but that's the fun part of it . "
A,Task,"I I wanted to go comm but I wasn't allowed . So "
C,Task,"Oh yeah ? "
C,Task,"okay . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Uh I just forgot to save this . "
A,Other,"Just a minute . "
A,Minor,". "
D,Elicit,"Yeah what's the next uh phase ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm this the last phase of course comm so "
D,Task,"Uh the agenda . "
D,Task,"By your humble P_M_ . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Oh f Frustrated . Alright . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um "
A,Task,"Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . "
A,Task,"But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense comm because we had to drop it . "
C,Task,"Drop everything . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Drop comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
C,Elicit,"We went straight into finance ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah it was more important comm so I just "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"For "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"pushed up the agenda . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm "
A,Task,"evaluation criteria . "
A,Elicit,"You have t produced something about that ? "
D,Task,"Yeah that that's Yeah . I uh I sure did . "
D,Task,"And it combines with product evaluation . "
D,Minor,"Uh so "
A,Elicit,"Uh you put it in the . "
D,Task,"We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . "
D,Task,"So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"F_ five . "
D,Other,"Let's make it big . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale comm as following . "
D,Task,"Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . "
D,Task,"True or false comm and then on a scale of seven points comm "
D,Task,"a scale comm as we all know it . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Well the criteria are based on the user requirements comm uh the trends from the marketing research comm and the marketing strategy of the company itself . "
D,Task,"Um well they are in a Word document comm "
D,Other,"which I will open now . "
A,Task,"Alt up "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't know it's open yet . "
D,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . "
D,Elicit,"What's this ? "
D,Task,"Oh . I don't know . "
A,Task,"Freaky . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Elicit,"Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . "
D,Task,"So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions . "
D,Elicit,"How do you think about that ? "
C,Task,"I think it does . "
C,Task,"Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ comm "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh comm of course we dropped a little bit of those uh "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"the us u "
D,Minor,"It it "
D,Task,"it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions comm in this question . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"So do you think "
C,Task,"Well comm we have extended menus comm on the on the L_C_D_ screen . So "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"You can you can ma "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited comm to to build in menus in the screen . "
C,Minor,"I "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Elicit,"So on a scale from one to seven comm what do you think ? "
B,Task,"Two or three . "
D,Other,"Huh ? "
B,Task,"Two or three . "
D,Elicit,"Two or three ? Something like that ? "
D,Task,"Well we have to choose one . "
A,Task,"Two . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So uh what do you say ? "
A,Task,"Uh y we should fill this in now . "
D,Task,"I agree on two . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah okay . "
D,Task,"I uh I say two comm personally . But "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now comm in original design I say two . "
C,Task,"Yeah alright . "
D,Task,"Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now . "
A,Task,"Okay then I say three . "
D,Task,"Yeah ? You say three comm "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"and you you said al also three ? "
D,Elicit,"Three ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay well I say still two comm but it has to be three then . "
A,Task,"Hey comm you're marketing comm eh . "
D,Task,"Yeah I know . "
D,Task,"So it's made bold . But it's nah comm it's not very clear on the sc "
A,Task,"Hmm . M maybe underline . "
B,Task,"Or give it a colour . "
D,Task,"Maybe other colour comm yeah . "
D,Task,"That's better . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"Red . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Alright . "
D,Task,"Oh comm it doesn't have to be bold anymore . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah very true . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah true one . "
D,Minor,"Um well the remote control has Wha "
A,Task,"He types everything . "
C,Task,"Definitely one . It has to be . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . "
D,Task,"For example audio settings and screen settings . "
B,Task,"It hides uh basic functions . "
A,Task,"Everything . You don't use anything else . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Well comm yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . "
C,Other,"You're not gonna find them . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah okay . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah true . "
D,Task,"But comm I mean uh they're hidden in the screen . "
D,Task,"If you don't want to use them comm you don't s you s just scroll over them . "
D,Task,"And you place them "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"F I don't know where . "
D,Task,"So that's very true comm I guess comm for our case . "
D,Task,"Uh the second point . "
C,Task,"Yeah the next Not so much so . "
D,Elicit,"It shows the relevant and most used functions . "
A,Minor,"Nope . "
D,Task,"Power button . "
D,Elicit,"Do we ha still have a power button ? "
A,Task,"Uh check with the Excel sheet . "
D,Task,"Well yeah the button's integrated comm huh ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"I think we are "
C,Task,"Yeah it's uh it's integrated . "
D,Task,"Yeah we dropped it . "
D,Minor,"You j you just push it in for "
B,Minor,"It's in "
B,Task,"Oh yeah it was integrateds . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah integrate it . "
D,Task,"Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something comm and then "
C,Task,"E exactly just like a m mobile . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"Just go scrolling and it will activate . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um it shows the relevant and most used functions . "
C,Minor,". "
D,Minor,"Yeah uh on the other "
D,Task,"uh on one side I would say yes comm and the other side I would say no . "
D,Task,"So it's I don't know . "
A,Task,"It shows the most used functions and they are relevant comm but "
B,Elicit,"Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"No comm you have to scroll through the menu comm before "
D,Minor,"With the scroll butt "
D,Task,"Yeah and then say channel . "
B,Task,"Yeah . So it's it's not "
D,Minor,"And then "
C,Task,"Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something comm if "
C,Task,"When it's on comm yeah comm it's turned on comm "
D,Other,"Hmm ? "
A,Elicit,"You say you double click on the "
C,Task,"It automatically has the the programme and the volume function comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Of you "
C,Task,"Or you double click it . "
D,Elicit,"But but how do you change from volume to channel ? "
C,Task,"No because it has four arrows comm "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"No comm not anymore . "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Because he's now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in . "
C,Task,"Oh yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick . "
A,Task,"Like on the the mouse . "
D,Task,"No we have n we have no buttons left . So "
C,Minor,"Say . "
D,Task,"the joystick was not an option . "
C,Task,"Yeah that is a bummer . "
D,Minor,"So so you hav "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So you you have to double-click comm "
D,Task,"I mean comm for comm I mean comm uh volume comm "
A,Task,"To get into menu . Yeah . "
D,Task,"and three double click for the menu comm or something . "
B,Task,"Oh no . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Or hold it ten seconds . "
D,Other,"Yeah . Yeah . Alright . "
C,Other,"We'll make it a Morse code . "
D,Task,"But but ease of use was not very important comm may I remind you . "
A,Task,"No no no . Uh it should be trendy . "
D,Minor,"So that's "
D,Task,"Yeah but that that's not a question . "
D,Task,"Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . "
D,Task,"Well I think it's pretty much in the middle . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Four . "
D,Task,"You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen comm in the menu . So "
A,Task,"Yeah comm im in the menu . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Seven . "
D,Task,"So maybe it's more like a f a five . Or "
B,Task,"Yeah . Five . "
C,Task,"Yeah I would go for five or six comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Five or six ? "
A,Task,"Five . "
C,Task,"Okay five . "
B,Task,"Five . Yep . "
D,Task,"Five ? Alright . "
C,Task,"Let's not diss our remote . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen . So "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Just one button . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Alright . "
A,Task,"Well it's different . "
D,Elicit,"Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . "
C,Task,"But Uh yep . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm it's still "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I say two . "
D,Task,"I say two then . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We still have the fruit and vegetable print . "
D,Task,"Yeah but that that's not that's not this question . Uh thi uh that's the other question . "
A,Task,"Oh comm that's the next . "
C,Task,"Fr Oh I mean the Oh never mind . "
C,Task,"I'm a bit lost . "
D,Task,"This one . "
B,Task,"I think a two . No . "
A,Task,"Two . "
D,Task,"Two yeah . "
D,Task,"I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech "
C,Minor,". "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Yeah definitely . "
D,Other,"What ? "
D,Other,"Oh not the bold one . "
C,Task,"It's way more practical comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Okay comm it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints comm primary colours and sponge-like material . "
D,Task,"It should have been two questions . I realise now comm because sponge-like material is dropped . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But the look and feel "
A,Elicit,"You still have rubber d Or no . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside comm not on the button . "
B,Task,"No you got a plastic . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The button has also colour . Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"The one button we have . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . The one . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve . "
A,Task,"Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet . "
D,Minor,"Mm mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . You only have one Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah we have single curve now comm "
C,Task,"And and colour . "
D,Task,"and no and no material "
C,Task,"Yeah . S "
D,Elicit,". So maybe in the middle or something . "
B,Task,"Four . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm I mean it's "
A,Task,"Yeah or three . "
D,Task,"worth the Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"We have something . "
C,Task,"Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . "
C,Task,"Because it's basically an old one comm uh with little curve on the side comm and in a different colour . "
C,Task,"Still comm it's still hard . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape comm that would give it something young and fresh . "
A,Task,"New . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . But then we would have to drop the screen . "
B,Task,"Red . "
D,Task,"Oh red . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You like both . "
D,Task,"Yeah . I like bold . "
D,Elicit,"Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo . "
A,Task,"Um oh yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"Of course . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I just couldn't "
D,Task,"You just have to draw it . "
A,Other,"Um comm just one minute . "
C,Minor,"Yeah but it "
B,Task,"It's the white part uh "
C,Task,"be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen comm we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . But "
B,Minor,"We have a we have a "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean comm if there's only one thing . "
C,Task,"Hell yeah . If we have only one button . "
D,Task,"Yeah . So I will say that is very true . "
A,Minor,". "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ comm "
C,Elicit,"doesn't it ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control is easy to use . "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Well I would say "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"Skill comm uh I would say six comm or something . I don't think it's easy to use comm or not so . "
C,Task,"The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button . "
B,Minor,"Ah i "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And that you only have to control one button . "
C,Task,"Yeah exactly . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It it it has a nice screen . "
D,Minor,"But Yeah . "
B,Task,"It gives visual feedback . So "
D,Task,"Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six . "
C,Task,"I would say six . "
B,Task,"I think a five . Five . "
D,Elicit,"What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ? "
C,Task,"It's really not easy to use . "
C,Minor,"'Cause you're putting everything "
A,Task,"No not anymore . "
D,Task,"So a six comm more . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm uh I would go for the six too . So "
B,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Most votes count . Um "
D,Task,"Um well comm another question comm "
B,Task,"Yeah that looks uh great . "
D,Elicit,"uh the remote control is durable . "
D,Task,"I don't know if that's the correct word . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Nah "
C,Task,"Definitely in casing comm 'cause we have a hard plastic "
D,Minor,"But uh "
D,Elicit,"In use comm both battery as casing ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Yeah because the the batteries comm those thingies last forever . "
D,Task,"True comm true . "
C,Task,"And the the casing comm hard plastic also lasts forever . "
D,Task,"And the casing is plastic comm ? "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Yeah . If you don't drop it too much comm it's uh should last pretty long . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So I would go for one . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate "
B,Minor,"Yeah . S "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Okay yeah . "
D,Minor,"than "
B,Other,"Wow . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Logo . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay I will go go for two . "
D,Task,"Uh the last one ? "
D,Elicit,"The remote control's a good example for company's motto comm we put the fashion in electronics . "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Task,"No m "
B,Other,"No we put the electronics into the fashion . "
D,Other,"uh turn around . Yeah . But um "
A,Other,"Yeah well yeah . "
C,Minor,"I would g "
C,Task,"I would go for four . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"No "
C,Task,"Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . "
D,Minor,"It's not "
D,Task,"Yeah comm true . "
A,Task,"Yeah okay . "
D,Task,"So a four . "
D,Minor,"It's it g "
D,Task,"it g goes comm it's not the best we could do comm I guess . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But it all has to do with the budget comm because it's it's not the bad idea we had comm so "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm four is okay . "
D,Task,"Alright comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"So if I understood it right comm we have to count these numbers . "
C,Elicit,"That's it . "
A,Other,"Ooh . "
A,Elicit,"And Yeah ? What ? "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Mm-hmm . Oh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Oh Alright . "
D,Other,"Word document comm the "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah we have to count them . "
A,Minor,"That "
A,Task,"Count them . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Elicit,"Add them ? Or "
D,Task,"Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . "
A,Task,"Could somebody start calculator ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"I all made it po I I all made it "
C,Task,"Ah we can do the math . Uh "
D,Task,"I all made it possible uh for a positive questions comm so we can count it . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I mean if you have reversed question comm you have to reverse the scale comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . You have to "
D,Minor,"uh Yes . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So four and "
C,Elicit,"Did you make this questionnaire or what ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
A,Task,"Nice work . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
B,Task,"Three plus ? "
C,Task,"I wouldn't be able to do it that fast . "
A,Task,"O one . "
B,Task,"Plus one . "
A,Task,"Plus five . "
B,Task,"Plus five ? "
A,Other,"Bo "
D,Other,"Oh Easy . "
D,Elicit,"Question number four comm yeah ? "
A,Task,"Uh two . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"F "
A,Task,"Four . "
B,Other,"Oh . Wait a second . Oh . "
B,Task,"It's it's gone wrong . "
D,Elicit,"How hard is it ? "
B,Task,"Okay . It's your turn . "
C,Task,"Pretty difficult . "
D,Minor,"Yeah just use "
A,Task,"Start over ? "
B,Task,"No it's if you press twice on the plus button comm then you get s s "
D,Minor,"Oh there tho uh there's no n "
D,Task,"There's no num pads . "
A,Minor,"You can "
B,Task,"No . That's why it's uh "
A,Task,"Oh yeah . "
D,Task,"It's a it's a bit uh "
C,Task,"Just type in the digits . "
C,Task,"They're all one digit numbers right ? "
C,Task,"And then you can count them together . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think you can just count them by a "
B,Task,"Just count it to Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um let's move over . "
A,Task,"Okay . Three comm four comm nine . "
D,Task,"Three comm plus one comm four . Nine . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Elicit,"Uh comm yeah . Are you here ? "
D,Task,"Eleven . "
C,Minor,"Eleven . "
A,Minor,"Eleven comm "
C,Minor,"Fifteen . "
D,Task,"Fifteen . "
A,Minor,"fifteen . "
B,Task,"Sixteen . "
C,Minor,"Sixteen . "
D,Minor,"Sixteen comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Seventeen . "
A,Minor,"Seventeen . "
D,Task,"No sixteen . "
D,Task,"Uh sixteen plus six . "
C,Elicit,"Oh what ? "
B,Task,"Twenty two . "
A,Minor,"S Uh "
D,Task,"Twenty two . "
C,Task,"How hard is this ? "
D,Task,"Twenty two comm "
D,Elicit,"yeah ? "
C,Task,"Never mind . "
B,Task,"Twenty four . Twenty six . "
D,Minor,"Tw "
C,Task,"Twenty four . Twenty eight . "
B,Other,"Oh comm sorry . . "
D,Minor,"Twenty "
D,Task,"Twenty eight . "
B,Other,"Oh my . "
A,Task,"That was the last one . That was that . "
C,Elicit,"Twenty eight . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . Twenty eight . "
A,Task,"So divided by nine . "
D,Task,"Twen Uh okay . "
D,Task,"By nine . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"That's uh three uh Or le less than a three . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Yeah the lower the "
C,Elicit,"The lower the score the better comm right ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Twenty eight "
C,Minor,"Yeah but "
A,Task,"Divided by nine . "
D,Task,"di divided by nine "
A,Minor,"So thr t two . "
D,Task,"makes three point one one one one one one one . "
A,Task,"So we're better than average . "
C,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings ? "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . "
B,Minor,"Some questions are Yeah . "
C,Task,"So if you give a true to a positive comm it actually means that the low the lower the better . "
C,Task,"But if you give true to a negative question "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but there are no negative questions I guess . "
C,Elicit,"No ? "
D,Task,"Good example . Durable use . "
C,Task,"Durable comm that's good . "
D,Task,"Easy to use . This is good . "
C,Task,"Easy to use . "
D,Task,"Fancy look and feel comm that's good . "
C,Task,"Yeah . . "
D,Task,"Technology innovation was good comm because of a marketing uh requirement . "
C,Task,"Also good . "
D,Task,"Re relevant most used function . "
C,Task,"Yeah okay . "
C,Task,"I guess you did do it . "
D,Task,"And hides these functions . That was also a good thing . "
B,Task,"Oh yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Oh yeah yeah . No "
D,Task,"And then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . Okay . "
D,Task,"So it were all positive questions comm by uh by purpose . So "
C,Task,"Yeah true . "
D,Task,"Yes comm so the It tells us something comm yes . "
D,Task,"Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things comm I guess . "
B,Task,"Oh great . "
A,Task,"Things comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah definitely definitely . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Because now it's just an average It's remote . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Nah it it's it's better than average comm but "
C,Task,"Yeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Task,"But uh it looks and stuff comm it still uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So th "
A,Task,"It's still yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Has some shortcomings . "
C,Task,"it's not comm it's not really eye-catching comm except for the colour . "
D,Minor,"No . "
D,Task,"The colour and the screen . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay so Um this we had comm this we had . "
C,Task,"Product evaluation . "
A,Task,"We have to do a product evaluation . "
A,Task,"Uh prototype presentation we dropped . "
A,Task,"So Uh the finance we looked . "
A,Task,"We have redesigned . "
A,Task,"Uh not on that comm but "
D,Task,"Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this "
B,Task,"Okay it's your turn now . "
C,Task,"Shall we try ? "
A,Task,"So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Other,"Black . "
D,Task,"With some casing around it comm yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? "
A,Task,"Yeah uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ? "
B,Task,"Yeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh "
A,Task,"The the button has a special colour comm the frame has a special colour . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"he only needs one button . "
C,Task,"One scroll button and "
A,Task,"It's plastic . And single curved . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or we have to delete this one or "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED . "
D,Task,"Oh yeah . "
B,Task,"Oh oh no . "
C,Elicit,"For what ? "
A,Task,"Otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So that's "
D,Elicit,"Do we have to do other things ? "
A,Other,"Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . "
D,Elicit,"Or just redesign ? "
D,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So I "
D,Elicit,"So you made a start comm right ? "
A,Task,"Yeah I'm I'm somewhere comm "
A,Task,"but maybe you can help me . "
C,Task,"Should give it some time ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yay . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Elicit,"Okay comm but how do we make the the scroll uh button ? "
A,Task,"I was here . So "
B,Task,"It's just one "
C,Other,"Have to take this away also . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
B,Task,"yeah . "

A,Elicit,"From up there ? "
A,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"B It's a normal T_V_ screen comm kind of thing . "
B,Task,"Hey comm you've got it uh read only . "
A,Task,"Yeah it's somewhere in here . "
B,Task,"So you have to uh "
A,Task,"Save copy . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Strange . "
D,Task,"This something what's projection from behind comm I guess . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,". "
B,Minor,"It's too uh "
A,Minor,". "
C,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Yeah there is some kind of projection I think . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"it it's a beamer comm but then with a "
C,Task,"With a with a mirror comm huh ? Or something . "
D,Task,"within a mirror comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So it looks like a big screen comm but in fact it isn't . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Elicit,"So are we gonna change anything to this ? "
B,Minor,"It is "
C,Minor,"I mean is it gonna "
D,Task,"Well it's it's single single curved . "
A,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"It's now single curved . So "
D,Task,"Th this is flat . Yeah . "
C,Task,"This is gonna be flat . Yeah exactly . "
B,Task,"It's flat . Oh no . "
B,Task,"Okay . It doesn't matter . "
B,Minor,"It's it's "
D,Task,"But it's it's better to have in the front comm this kind of shape comm because it looks nice . "
D,Task,"I mean you see more of this than of that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm more like that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And this is also gonna be "
D,Task,"It's not very uh ideal . "
C,Task,"Nope . "
D,Task,"Do like this . "
C,Task,"But sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"What's this ? "
B,Task,"That's the detector uh for the "
D,Other,"Ooh . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"But I don't see a detector over there . "
C,Minor,"Maybe "
B,Task,"Yeah . I don't know . "
C,Minor,"No it's "
C,Task,"I think you only need two points . "
C,Task,"Or not . "
C,Minor,"No comm you sh "
D,Task,"I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on comm and then draw right lines or something . "
B,Task,"Maybe that's why it's it's not working comm because it's more "
C,Task,"Slanted yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Or just messed it up . "
C,Task,"Well maybe . "
B,Task,"Oh . Oh yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah but it wasn't good . "
B,Task,"You've to make it s uh ninety degrees . "
D,Task,"Yeah it it has to touch the corners comm I guess . "
D,Task,"But th this one wasn't good comm because if I was drawing here comm I drew a line and then it came over here . "
A,Task,"Um now you probably have to recalibrate . "
B,Minor,"You have "
A,Task,"Oh comm five minutes to the end of the meeting . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"Oh we're always long . "
A,Task,"And the recalibration is done using this icon here . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"Ooh . "
B,Elicit,"can we t can we get to that @ i "
B,Task,"Oh it's not working anymore . "
A,Minor,"Yeah well I just "
B,Task,"Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah comm it's it's working comm it's working . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah comm it's it's okay . It's working again . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It's better than before . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We're improving uh Yeah . "
A,Task,"You go ahead . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's improved uh pretty much . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah it's only a bit like to that side comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but that is that one by the way . "
D,Minor,"Yeah but it's better comm it's better "
C,Task,"'Cause this one makes the angle either like this . "
B,Minor,"No it "
C,Task,"So i if I change this comm it will go there comm if I change that comm will go there . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"No . It's better than it was I guess . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"I will take this away 'cause it looks messy . "
D,Task,"Silly . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Works pretty well . "
D,Elicit,"Five minutes before the meeting's over . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"And then ? "
D,Elicit,"We have to present "
A,Other,"Then I have to uh uh write this comm "
A,Task,"and I don't know if you have to present comm because I didn't receive any information about that so far . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
C,Task,"Maybe we will . "
A,Task,"Maybe we get a a final mail . "
D,Minor,"So it after the "
D,Elicit,"after after these five minutes comm you have to "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I have still ten minutes to finish the report . "
C,Elicit,"What's this anyway ? "
B,Task,"So cake . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
D,Elicit,"After after that five minutes comm you have ten minutes to finish it comm or "
C,Task,"It looks like candle wax . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
D,Elicit,"And we uh "
A,Task,"And you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or "
D,Task,"Right . Chill . "

A,Task,"The presentation is still open . "
A,Task,"So if you finish that then you'll see uh "
A,Task,"Yeah next . "
D,Task,"Next slide . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah comm we have to do the project uh evaluation . "
A,Task,"Just uh do that quickly . "
D,Task,"Yeah ? "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Elicit,"How do you do it ? "
A,Task,"Uh well basically what that says comm we discuss it and um "
A,Elicit,"So how were did the project process uh go ? "
D,Task,"Alright . "
A,Elicit,"Did you comm were you all pleased with the process as it was ? "
A,Minor,"Or are there uh "
C,Elicit,"Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or "
A,Task,"Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed comm and and so forth . "
C,Task,"Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on comm the second time I think I did a bit better . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And the third time yeah comm I mean "
D,Task,"And we move more to to working together as team comm "
B,Minor,"No . "
D,Task,"because at first you you make your individual contribution comm and then come here comm and you have no idea what the others have to make . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"No . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"And then finally you have some idea comm okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So "
D,Task,"The process comm I mean comm the interaction between us became better and better I guess . "
C,Minor,"Yeah we "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Especially after the first meeting . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm especially if f f if you see uh you se "
B,Minor,"And "
D,Task,"you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Definitely . "
A,Elicit,"Okay and was that due to my leadership ? "
B,Other,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"Well you did become more assertive the the second time round comm so that "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . You were more in charge kind of thing . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"That okay ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Um was there uh enough room for creativity ? "
C,Task,"I guess so . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"but only the the financial parts uh "
C,Minor,"I mean "
D,Task,"Li Limiteded afterwards comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"but If if you don't take that into account comm there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . "
C,Minor,"I "
D,Task,"Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself comm but also in explaining it to the other people comm by means of uh "
C,Task,"We were pretty democratic . "
D,Task,"the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that . "
A,Elicit,"So and the uh about the board digital pen ? "
A,Elicit,"Uh was that helpful or "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm uh I think in in essence "
A,Other,"Ooh . "
D,Task,"the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . "
D,Task,"Because it it it just works better . "
D,Minor,"I mean uh uh I've made "
A,Task,"Yeah it works . "
D,Task,"yeah comm uh I've made several notes just to test it comm "
D,Task,"and and just put the pen in into it comm and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So it it's better a better device than uh "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"than the screen . "
C,Task,"Maybe Yeah . "
D,Task,"But the screen is useful comm in essence comm but it doesn't work that well . "
C,Minor,"It's uh it's "
C,Task,"The the pen is more intuitive comm 'cause we're all used to writing with pen . "
A,Minor,"Use the pen . "
C,Task,"And uh as I said comm uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works comm so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But once I get to know the program probably comm I mean comm it looks better comm you know . "
C,Task,"Or uh something like that . "
C,Task,"You can "
C,Task,"give it a kind of a home style comm "
C,Task,"like we have i the the logo and everything . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Other,"And I don't know . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Other,"Blink . Oh . "
D,Task,"Warning . Finish meeting now . "
B,Minor,"Finish meeting . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm are are there any new ideas about this ? "
A,Task,"All I think "
A,Task,"I didn't really receive comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well comm it "
D,Task,"It's use especially useful comm I guess comm to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . "
A,Minor,"Uh uh w uh "
D,Minor,"And and "
A,Other,"S sorry uh "
D,Task,"the screen and stuff like that . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I think the PowerPoint is is too limited . "
B,Task,"You can't uh draw easy in in PowerPoint . "
B,Minor,"It has to be uh yeah . "
B,Task,"The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint comm so that you can just easily "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You know comm you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there comm or whatever . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . But it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience comm and then to "
B,Task,"Yeah just for text comm for text it's uh it's okay . But "
D,Task,"Yeah . These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things . So "
D,Task,"Yes . Check your email . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Uh we should uh enter our questionnaire . "
D,Task,"You also . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"Ah . "
A,Other,"Woah . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
D,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"Okay . Uh okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
