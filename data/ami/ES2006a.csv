D,Minor,".. . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So comm this is uh first meeting of this design project . "
C,Other,"Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting comm "
C,Elicit,"I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . "
D,Minor,"Mm comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Maybe not . "
D,Task,"I didn't receive it yet . "
C,Minor,"Anyway comm "
C,Task,"this is the the plan for today's meeting "
C,Task,"is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly comm "
C,Task,"um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . "
C,Task,"Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings comm "
C,Task,"um specifically the whiteboard over there . "
C,Task,"Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um "
C,Minor,"and discuss "
C,Task,"come up with some preliminary ideas about it . "
C,Task,"And then that's it . "
C,Task,"So we've got twenty five minutes to do that comm "
C,Task,"that's until eleven twenty five . "
C,Elicit,"S so any any questions ? "
A,Minor,"so sh "
C,Minor,"Is i "
D,Task,"Not at this point . "
C,Task,"not at this point . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Task,"So this is our project . "
C,Task,"What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . "
C,Task,"Um we want it to be something original comm something trendy and also something user friendly comm "
C,Task,"so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . "
C,Task,"The method that we're going to use to complete the project comm that has three components as such . "
C,Task,"There's the functional design of the the remote control . "
C,Minor,"We're going "
C,Task,"the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially "
C,Task,"and then come together for meetings to to work on that . "
C,Task,"Um similarly with the conceptual design comm "
C,Task,"we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops "
C,Task,"and then we'll bring what we've done together . "
C,Task,"Um and then the detailed design will come after that . "
C,Task,"We'll pull it all together . "
A,Task,"I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? "
A,Elicit,"Uh i is it just uh more detail comm uh as I understand it ? "
C,Task,"I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be "
C,Task,"we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control "
C,Task,"and what what specific things it it has to do "
A,Other,"Right . "
C,Task,"but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that "
C,Task,"and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . "
A,Task,"How how it will be done . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Minor,"I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the "
A,Elicit,"it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? "
C,Task,"Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay comm so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . "
C,Task,"Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project comm "
C,Task,"specifically the whiteboard . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"each person in turn comm I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard comm "
C,Task,"the pen's just underneath it there "
C,Task,"and draw your favourite animal "
C,Task,"and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are "
C,Task,"and while you're doing that tell us your name comm what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . "
B,Elicit,"Why are you looking at me ? "
C,Elicit,"Would you like to go first ? "
B,Elicit,"Do I have a choice ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Ooh ooh comm things falling everywhere . "
C,Minor,"Oh comm yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Right comm okay . "
C,Task,"p put them in pockets . "
B,Other,"Cool . "
C,Task,"You don't have to hurry comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"we've got plenty of time . "
B,Task,"So comm my name's Cat "
B,Other,"and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey "
B,Minor,"so um "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"It's got no eyes . "
B,Task,"Oh comm good point . "
B,Other,"Ah comm the eyes always ruin it . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Other,"Okay comm what do it's eyes like ? "
B,Other,"Okay comm cool . "
B,Task,"Um this is a rabbit . "
C,Task,"I thought it might be a cat . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"well origi uh "
D,Task,"at first I thought it was going to be cat . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I don't think it's furry enough comm "
B,Other,"so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . "
D,Task,"Yeah now I now I understand now comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"I can see by the ears . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm right comm "
B,Task,"it's a fluffy rabbit comm blue . "
B,Task,"Rabbits don't come in blue but you know . "
B,Task,"Um okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Other,"And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . "
D,Other,"Ah . "
B,Elicit,"Okay ? "
C,Task,"Excellent comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"and what's your what's your role within the team ? "
B,Minor,"I am the um "
B,Task,"I need my notebook comm "
B,Other,"mm ooh "
B,Other,"top banana . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm cool comm "
B,Task,"I am the Marketing Expert "
B,Minor,"um so like "
B,Task,"I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design comm um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"um so yeah . "
C,Task,"And more about yourself comm "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Elicit,"you're from ? "
B,Task,"Um I'm from Leicester comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"um second year . "
B,Elicit,"Um what else do you want to know ? "
B,Task,"I like sports um yeah comm aerobics comm kickboxing comm spinning "
B,Minor,"um and uh "
C,Other,"But not with rabbits . "
B,Task,"not with rabbits comm no no . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"And vets comm I like vets as well . "
B,Task,"And yeah um and I like cocktails comm especially pink ones . "
B,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Minor,"Cool . "
C,Task,"Excellent comm "
B,Other,"Cool . "
C,Task,"to match the rabbit . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Um so my name is Maarika . "
D,Task,"Where's the pen ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"There's a an "
C,Task,"if you have not enough room there's an eraser there "
C,Task,"and you can rub it off . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm well comm "
D,Other,"or I can make it smaller . "
D,Minor,"Uh so um um "
D,Task,"I'm the Interface Designer in this project "
D,Minor,"and my favourite animal comm "
D,Other,"I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um familiar with all kinds of animals comm "
D,Task,"but I do like dogs . "
D,Other,"Oh comm sorry comm "
D,Other,"maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"mm hmm . "
D,Task,"Um well comm there are different kinds of dogs comm but okay um . "
A,Task,"That's not bad at all . "
C,Other,"Ah "
C,Task,"it looks like a dog . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit . "
B,Task,"I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"maybe it has some colourful patches comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people "
C,Task,"the other legs are on the other side . "
D,Task,"and they are loyal . "
D,Minor,"Mm comm "
D,Task,"well that's compared to some other animals like cats . "
D,Task,"Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say . "
D,Task,"Uh I hope to be loyal to the project "
D,Task,"and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something comm yeah . "
C,Elicit,"And where where are you from ? "
D,Task,"I'm from Estonia "
D,Task,"uh comm yep . "
C,Task,"Estonia . "
D,Elicit,"Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? "
D,Other,"Oh comm right comm my roles comm "
D,Task,"um so um in the different um stages of the design comm so at first I will be responsible for um for yeah comm designing the technical functions of the um um of the remote control "
A,Minor,". "
D,Task,"uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept "
D,Task,"and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . "
A,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Okay comm that's it . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"Okay um I'll do some "
A,Other,"I'll rub the features "
A,Other,"and let the drawing stay . "
A,Minor,"'Kay "
A,Task,"um my name is Gaurav . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Other,"my favourite animal "
A,Task,"one of my favourite animals is a cow . "
A,Task,"I've got no idea how to draw a cow . "
C,Other,"Good luck . "
A,Task,"Uh this is going to be "
B,Task,"They're not just like a big round body "
B,Task,"and then some really skinny legs "
B,Task,"and then just some horns . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that'll do . "
A,Other,"Okay comm so let let me draw the body first . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"Big comm round body comm really skinny legs "
A,Task,"and they've got a long tail "
A,Task,"and a long face . "
C,Task,"It's eating . "
B,Task,"It looks like Eeyore . "
A,Task,"And there is some grass there . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So this is what I like about cows "
A,Task,"that they just keeps sitting there eating grass comm "
B,Task,"Horns comm "
B,Task,"draw some horns . "
A,Task,"they do not disturb anybody um "
A,Task,"they're kind of Buddhist in a way . "
A,Task,"So yeah comm I like cows . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer comm "
A,Task,"so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um "
A,Task,"ho how it works "
A,Task,"and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role comm "
A,Task,"what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design comm "
A,Task,"what are the various components of it "
A,Minor,"and um finally comm "
A,Task,"I'm not too sure what was the last part . "
A,Other,"Um the detailed design comm "
A,Task,"I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . "
A,Task,"Um I'm from India . "
A,Task,"Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics comm "
A,Task,"I sit at the Department of Psychology . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Excellent . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
C,Other,"Right comm now now it's my turn obviously . "
C,Other,"Okay comm here's a space . "
A,Task,"That doesn't look like a cow comm does it ? "
D,Task,"It looks very very cute . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I like the cow . "
C,Task,"I'm Jen . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Um I like dogs too comm "
C,Task,"but I can't do that already "
C,Task,"because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . "
C,Other,"I like "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"Is that a lizard ? "
A,Task,"No way . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Wow . "
C,Task,"It's a gecko . "
D,Other,"Ah comm a gecko comm okay . "
A,Other,"Ah okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Is there a difference ? "
D,Elicit,"Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they "
C,Minor,"They're "
C,Task,"Yeah comm they're "
D,Other,"yeah comm they are "
C,Task,"l it's a kind of lizard . "
D,Other,"mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And I I like geckos "
C,Task,"because they remind me of warm places "
D,Other,"Ah . "
C,Task,"and comm and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"and they were on the ceiling "
C,Task,"and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I hope you don't like snakes comm "
D,Elicit,"do you ? "
C,Task,"I don't like snakes . "
C,Task,"I come from Australia "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"and we have nasty snakes . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"That's where I'm from comm Australia . "
C,Task,"I'm from Melbourne "
C,Task,"and I'm your Project Manager for today "
C,Task,"and my role is basically to keep things going "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and make sure that you all work together in a productive way comm so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . "
D,Task,"Wonderful . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Task,"So comm let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation . "
C,Minor,"So comm I've just thought "
B,Task,"If you right click on it you can "
C,Task,"yeah "
C,Other,"I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"there we go . "
C,Task,"Okay comm so this is the um overall budget for our project . "
C,Minor,"We've got "
C,Task,"um we're planning to sell these remote controls for "
C,Other,"let's make that go away comm "
C,Task,"that means we've got five minutes . "
C,Task,"Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . "
C,Task,"Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . "
C,Task,"And that's selling them on the international market comm not just in the U_K_ . "
C,Task,"Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . "
C,Task,"So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"This is "
C,Other,"let me just skip ahead to see "
C,Task,"that's the last thing comm "
C,Task,"okay . "
C,Task,"We've only got a couple of minutes . "
C,Elicit,"Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ? "
D,Task,"Yep . "
D,Elicit,"I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us comm "
C,Task,"but if we all have a think comm when we go away from the meeting comm what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy comm user friendly and original "
A,Task,"so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned comm "
A,Task,"that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . "
C,Task,"Something something new . "
B,Unlab,"Yeah comm I was looking at the website comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"and the other things that they've made "
B,Task,"and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics "
B,Task,"and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional comm you know ? "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"So I'm kind of thinking comm you know like those phones that they have comm the new generation ones comm where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . "
C,Task,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
B,Task,"You know comm so something heading towards that comm "
B,Minor,"so it's not overly "
B,Task,"I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls comm "
B,Task,"so I figure how many do you need comm you know ? "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing comm or "
B,Task,"Something that's a little less crowded than this comm "
B,Task,"like I mean you know comm theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ comm right ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"But what do most people do ? "
B,Task,"They turn it on comm they watch certain specified channels comm you know comm and then they turn it off again . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time comm "
B,Task,"Sometimes they play a movie . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but will be used ten percent of the time comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"there's no need to have buttons on it to do that comm "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"no . "
B,Minor,"maybe to do "
A,Task,"Yep . "
C,Task,"It could be one button for a menu or something comm if you really need to go and do that . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"And then use the "
B,Task,"So comm if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works comm then you know that's fine "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons comm which just confuse them . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Other,"Excellent . "
B,Task,"'Cause like if you look at the train comm it's just very like comm there's no extra bits on it comm "
B,Task,"the train on the website "
B,Task,"and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing "
C,Task,"Oh I haven't had a look yet comm "
C,Minor,"yep . "
B,Task,"um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people comm "
B,Task,"but it looks really pretty too . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"Great . "
C,Elicit,"Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Uh we can aim for "
A,Task,"I mean we can think about all these little things comm "
A,Task,"but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life comm "
A,Task,"although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway comm battery life comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones comm "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"A big learning curve comm yeah . "
D,Task,"with l learning comm yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So comm i it should kind of fit in as well comm "
A,Minor,"and the stereotype of a "
C,Task,"It's like those fancy websites that you can't access "
D,Minor,"Hm-hmm . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"because you have no idea how to get in comm "
C,Task,"but the designers thought they were great . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"so we need to wrap it up now comm "
C,Task,"so that we can go away and get on with some of this . "
C,Task,"Um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes comm "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Minor,"you're "
C,Task,"you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace comm "
C,Task,"but im basically you're looking at the working design comm "
A,Other,"Alright . "
C,Task,"you're looking at the technical functions design comm "
C,Task,"and for you it's the user requirements specification comm "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"like you said at the start . "
C,Elicit,"Okay ? "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Thanks for that . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Task,"Uh I'll see you in half an hour . "
D,Other,"See you . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"Carry the laptops back again . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Elicit,"Do we need to unplug things ? "
C,Task,"Probably . "
