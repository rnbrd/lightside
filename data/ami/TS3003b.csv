A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Everybody found his place again ? Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Other,"That's nice . "
A,Minor,"Okay so "
A,Task,"this is our second meeting . "
A,Minor,"And uh "
A,Elicit,"still failing ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh now we're going um into the functional design . "
A,Task,"Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements comm technical function design comm and the working design . So that we can move onto the second uh phase . "
A,Task,"But first this phase . "
A,Other,"Um first an announcement . "
A,Task,"There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"There's our ghost mouse again . "
A,Task,"That that means that you can have a little trouble with comm little trouble with the air conditioning comm "
A,Minor,"that's because of this uh "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"It's in wing C_ and E_ . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"it should be over in a in a while comm couple of days . "
A,Task,"But it's going to be cold anyway comm "
A,Task,"so I don't think you're gonna need it . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Then our agenda . "
A,Minor,"Now "
A,Task,"first the opening . "
A,Other,"Uh this time I will take the minutes . "
A,Task,"Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you . "
A,Task,"Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . "
A,Task,"So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation comm "
A,Task,"and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements "
A,Task,"uh which have been sent to me . "
A,Task,"And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we've got forty minutes for all of it . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I suggest um let's start with the first presentation . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"Um who wants to be first ? "
D,Other,"Think I'll go first . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Just maybe it's easier if you um "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"I think you will tell your presentation as well . Just which function you have "
A,Task,"and what you're gonna talk about . "
D,Task,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"My name is Freek Van Ponnen . "
D,Task,"I'm the Market Expert . "
D,Task,"But you already knew that . "
D,Task,"Um I've done some research . "
D,Task,"We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab "
D,Task,"where we observed um users operating remote controls . "
D,Task,"Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . "
D,Task,"We had one hundred of these uh test subjects . "
D,Task,"Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"these are three quite astonishing results comm I thought . "
D,Task,"Um remotes are being considered ugly . "
D,Minor,"F "
D,Task,"uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . "
D,Task,"Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Um in addition remotes were not very functional . "
D,Task,"Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . "
D,Task,"And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"some things . "
D,Task,"Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . "
D,Task,"Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . "
D,Task,"The power button got a nine . "
D,Task,"And teletext got a six and a half . "
D,Task,"So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . "
D,Task,"Then there are some one-time use function . "
D,Task,"That's what I like to call them . "
D,Task,"That uh audio settings comm video settings comm and channel settings buttons . "
D,Task,"Which are not really used very frequently comm "
D,Task,"but are still considered to be of some importance . "
D,Task,"Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . "
D,Minor,"Then these are the "
D,Task,"This is the market . "
D,Task,"Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . "
D,Task,"Um Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . "
D,Task,"Um they like to use new f new functions . "
D,Task,"But they also are very critical . "
D,Task,"They won't spend their money very easily . "
D,Minor,"So Um "
D,Task,"the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . "
D,Task,"They are not really very interested in features . "
D,Task,"But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . "
D,Task,"What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future . "
D,Task,"And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . "
D,Task,"Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market comm "
D,Task,"so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . "
D,Task,"Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . "
D,Task,"Um The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . "
D,Task,"Um this is certainly something to take into account . "
D,Task,"And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control comm remote control . "
D,Task,"So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . "
D,Task,"Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . "
D,Task,"And the functionality As a lot of people indicated comm they only use about ten percent of the buttons comm "
D,Task,"I think we should make very few buttons . "
D,Task,"Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . "
D,Task,"Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . "
D,Task,"'Cause they're used most "
D,Task,"and so they should be robust . "
D,Task,"They shouldn't break down easily . "
D,Task,"Um Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room comm "
D,Minor,"it might be "
D,Task,"and I say might be "
D,Task,"because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . "
D,Task,"But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . "
D,Task,"And this would comm could get a button in it "
D,Task,"which would send a signal to the remote "
D,Task,"which would then beep . "
D,Task,"So you'd know where it is in the room . "
D,Task,"And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . "
D,Task,"Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . "
D,Task,"This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . "
D,Task,"But up till forty five it remains feasible . "
D,Task,"This would also greatly increase the production costs "
D,Task,"but I think these are just some small factors we could consider . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"That would be all . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"anybody have um any questions until now ? "
D,Elicit,"Any questions ? "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"About functional requirements ? "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"Okay "
A,Task,"that's clear . "
D,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Now to the second . "
B,Minor,"Uh okay . Um "
B,Task,"I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . Um "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"you can take your time . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We've got uh plenty of time comm "
B,Other,"Mm ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"you should go to the top thingy . Slide show . "
A,Minor,"so "
B,Other,"Oh . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Oh yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . There it is . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um yeah . "
B,Task,"I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . "
B,Task,"Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet "
B,Task,"and not much information about it comm Um about uh interface "
B,Minor,"but uh Uh Yeah "
B,Task,"I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . "
B,Task,"Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television comm uh stereo . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"But uh it must be uh user-friendly . "
B,Minor,"So um uh "
B,Task,"you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh Yeah . Uh uh uh Yeah . In one um remote control . "
A,Task,"One remote . "
B,Minor,"But um "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um yeah . "
B,Task,"Got uh many functions in one uh remote control comm "
B,Minor,"um but um yeah "
B,Task,"you can see comm this is uh quite simple uh remote control . "
B,Task,"Um few uh buttons "
B,Task,"but uh This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . "
B,Task,"Um uh people uh don't like it comm "
B,Minor,"uh so um "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . "
B,Task,"Uh everybody everybody knows it "
B,Task,"so uh uh you don't have to change that . Um "
B,Task,"My personal uh preferences um . "
B,Task,"Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um Uh this the remote control uh "
B,Task,"and uh you got here the general functions comm uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh I dunno um "
B,Task,"And um here you've got a s kind of a display . "
B,Task,"It's a touchscreen . "
B,Minor,"So um yeah "
B,Task,"you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh . "
B,Task,"And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"this button is for a D_V_D_ "
B,Minor,"or "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"that's uh my uh idea about it . "
A,Other,"'Kay . "
B,Minor,"Um yeah and "
B,Minor,"Uh let's see . Uh yeah . So "
B,Task,"a touchscreen . "
B,Task,"Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . "
B,Task,"We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh "
B,Minor,"for "
B,Minor,"um yeah . "
B,Task,"Everybody uh have to use it so Uh ol even even old people um young people . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . "
B,Minor,"So uh Um "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Uh yeah . "
B,Task,"That was uh my uh part of it . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"Anybody has questions about the technical functions ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros . "
B,Task,"N I I don't think so . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something . "
A,Task,"Touchscreen . "
B,Minor,"Uh it's just uh um one colo Uh "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago . "
B,Task,"Uh you got uh yeah quite an uh a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh for uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Task,"So it's possible . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"'Kay . That's nice . Uh "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"it would certainly make a fancy design . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But the It wouldn't be very robust . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"It's very fragile "
C,Task,"and you can get scratches on it . "
D,Task,"That is true . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
B,Task,"Yeah that's true . "
D,Task,"We would have to look into that . "
A,Elicit,"Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ? "
A,Task,"Uh And then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design . "
B,Task,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's . Okay . "
A,Minor,"I think it's going to "
A,Task,"Uh it's not too much . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay "
C,Other,"I've got a presentation about the working design . "
C,Other,"Um first about how it works . "
C,Task,"It's really simple of course . "
C,Task,"Everybody knows how a remote works . "
C,Task,"The user presses a button . "
C,Task,"The remote determines what button it is comm "
C,Task,"uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . "
C,Task,"The T_V_ switches to the frequency comm or what function it is . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we've got um the the plate . "
C,Task,"It gots conductive disks for every button . "
C,Task,"When the user presses a button comm a signal got sent comm "
C,Task,"goes to the LED "
C,Task,"and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . "
C,Task,"It's a very simple device comm technically speaking . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"this is a schematic overview . "
C,Task,"You've got the buttons . "
C,Task,"The power source . "
C,Task,"And uh when a button gets pressed comm its goes to the chip . "
C,Task,"The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . "
C,Task,"When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . "
C,Minor,"Well um "
C,Task,"I think we should use default materials comm simple plastics . "
C,Task,"Keep the inner workings simple comm "
C,Task,"so it's robust . "
C,Task,"Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics comm the design and the user interface comm "
C,Task,"because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . "
C,Task,"And uh you only have to design a remote once comm "
C,Task,"and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"it's comm in my idea comm it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . "
C,Task,"That's it . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh Okay "
A,Task,"now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have "
A,Task,"and what we are doing right now . "
A,Task,"Um I'm the Project Manager "
A,Other,"so I'm here to mess things up "
A,Other,"and uh tell you some new uh requirements . "
A,Minor,"Um that's comm "
A,Task,"we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . "
A,Task,"Um that's because uh it will be too complex "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"and the time to market will be too big comm if we wanna have it uh for more functions . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"So it has to be simple . "
A,Task,"Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext comm "
A,Task,"because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . "
A,Task,"And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control . "
A,Task,"Um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . "
A,Task,"Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . "
A,Task,"Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target comm "
A,Task,"because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . "
A,Other,"Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert . "
A,Task,"Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . "
A,Task,"So we have to find a market which is above forty plus "
A,Task,"uh but which will suit our "
A,Task,"uh remote control comm "
A,Task,"and the other way round . "
A,Task,"And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . "
A,Task,"So it has to be visible in our design comm in the way our device works . "
A,Task,"And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ? "
A,Task,"Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature "
D,Task,"and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . "
D,Task,"And new T_V_s will have internet access on them . "
D,Task,"But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus comm the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access "
D,Task,"within the next like twenty years is very slim . "
D,Task,"In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . "
D,Task,"I'm pretty much against it . "
A,Other,"Against the no teletext ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Besides that comm I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . "
D,Task,"But I mean if I s if I see this comm it's I think we're just gonna go for another "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"it's it is "
B,Minor,"forty "
A,Task,"Standard remote . "
D,Task,"pretty "
A,Task,"No "
A,Minor,"I think we can "
D,Task,"and not innovative "
A,Task,"I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons "
D,Task,"remote control . "
A,Task,"which were also mentioned . "
A,Task,"Uh if we put a lot of effort in those comm we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach "
A,Task,"because it is forty percent of the market . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"And um "
A,Task,"if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus comm fifty plus comm it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . "
D,Task,"Yes "
D,Task,"but it's not the biggest part of the market . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"And besides that comm they're not very critical "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like . "
D,Task,"They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . "
A,Elicit,"But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market comm that people think the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"let's try it . "
D,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . "
D,Task,"because they are critical "
D,Task,"and they they want to have a fancy remote control . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"People of forty plus comm I mean they want it to work comm "
D,Task,"but as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think that if we're If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um I don't know if you've heard about it in the news comm the the elderly mobile phone ? "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's a big success . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind comm we could make tons of money comm I think . "
D,Task,"I haven't heard of it . "
A,Task,"Very big success . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Uh . I think so as well . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . "
C,Task,"We just "
C,Task,"change our focus on the project comm "
C,Task,"and I think we can uh we can sell this . "
A,Task,"Uh I simply think um "
A,Task,"uh that the new products we are gonna make comm uh spef specifically design comm are designed for uh younger people comm "
A,Task,"uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . "
A,Task,"And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . "
A,Task,"'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important . Volume selection comm power and teletext . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But obviously the board tends to disagree . "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"we we haven't voted yet comm "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"Uh I think teletext can be uh "
A,Task,"um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost comm "
A,Task,"because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well comm "
A,Task,"but I don't think it will be a problem . "
A,Minor,"Or is teletext a "
B,Task,"But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm also . "
B,Minor,"So it's "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"I suggest uh "
D,Task,"I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . "
B,Minor,"It's "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Is anybody um really against teletext ? "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"No ? "
A,Task,"Just that comm that we just keep the teletext . "
A,Task,"I think that's a good idea as well comm especially for the subtitles . "
A,Task,"Maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control comm if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles comm "
A,Task,"which is instantly on the remote control . "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"For elderly people they can think comm oh I wanna have subtitles comm "
A,Task,"and they push the button "
A,Task,"and they get the big subtitles . "
C,Task,"Uh that's a good idea . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Task,"I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . Um "
A,Task,"Functionality should be few buttons comm you said . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So to keep it simple . "
D,Task,"But I don't think that's really an issue any more "
D,Minor,"'cause "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"might be . "
B,Minor,"If it's only for televi "
D,Task,"But I mean it comm if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"You need a one to zero button comm next channel comm previous channel comm "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"volume up comm volume down comm and some teletext buttons "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"But do you need "
D,Minor,"I think if you if you only l "
B,Task,"So we can s we can skip the display comm "
B,Task,"so uh we don't need it . "
A,Elicit,"But do you need the buttons for one to zero . "
D,Task,"Nah . "
A,Minor,"Maybe c we can "
B,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . "
D,Task,"I think many people like to use that . "
A,Minor,"Maybe we can use uh "
D,Task,"'Cause if you should comm if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five comm you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Elicit,"maybe we can implement the scroll button ? "
A,Elicit,"Or a joystick like ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"There are other ways too . "
A,Task,"Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That's true "
D,Task,"but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . "
D,Task,"And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . "
D,Task,"And I dunno if many channels would do have that . If many T_V_s have that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"And besides that it's um "
C,Task,"If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . "
C,Task,"They're not used to using scroll buttons . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
C,Task,"So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
A,Other,"the numbers yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display comm "
A,Task,"and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it . "
A,Task,"But I think there won't be very much buttons . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Or there don't have to be a lot . "
D,Task,"But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ comm you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . "
D,Task,"'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ comm "
D,Task,"which already only have the minimum number of buttons . "
D,Task,"I don't think there's much to be gained in that area . "
A,Elicit,"The number of buttons ? "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it's very important in the in the design . "
A,Task,"You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . "
A,Minor,"And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with "
D,Task,"That is true "
D,Task,"but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ . "
A,Other,"To operate only the T_V_ yeah . "
D,Task,"'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required . "
D,Task,"There's not a lot of functions required "
D,Task,"so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"So . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . "
A,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"we can "
D,Task,"That would that would cost a a big marketing expedition "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's right . "
D,Task,"which was one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ "
D,Task,"because we didn't have the time to market a lot . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station . "
A,Elicit,"Uh uh like other functions . Instead of f of less buttons . "
D,Task,"Maybe . "
D,Minor,"Well yeah "
D,Task,"I think comm mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons "
D,Minor,"and "
D,Task,"But I don't think we should spend very much time in that . "
A,Other,"Mm . No . "
A,Elicit,"Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ? "
C,Task,"It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy . "
A,Minor,"'Cause it can be "
B,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"And if the remote stays rather small comm it should be possible "
A,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"No . "
A,Minor,"Because I think that's uh "
A,Task,"That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"or very "
B,Task,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"That's a nice requirement . "
A,Other,"Docking station . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"we're just gonna focus on the extras ? "
A,Task,"I think so . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"like to have extra in a new remote control . "
A,Task,"That's a good point . Um "
A,Task,"You said they easily get lost as well . "
D,Task,"Yes "
D,Minor,"well "
D,Task,"fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So maybe we should implement the audio sign comm or something . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"that was what I suggested . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Like with your key-chain comm if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound . "
D,Minor,"You have it on "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"Hm . "
D,Task,"you have it's on some phones too comm "
D,Task,"which have a docking station . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And you just press a button "
D,Task,"and the phone goes ringing . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . So "
D,Task,"So you know where it is . "
A,Task,"audio signal should be possible as well . "
A,Task,"I think it's not too expensive . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"Uh another "
A,Elicit,"point is the L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Task,"Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much comm "
C,Minor,"Y i "
A,Minor,"because "
C,Task,"um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen comm "
C,Minor,"'cause "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"it's uh "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"It will be too much as well . "
D,Task,"I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn comm "
D,Task,"and we're focusing on elderly people here "
D,Task,"which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices comm "
D,Task,"it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it comm "
D,Task,"which would explain a button if you press it . "
D,Task,"Which would tell you what it does . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen comm "
A,Task,"Based . "
B,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Elicit,"Just the L_C_D_ . "
A,Elicit,"Oh just the normal screen . "
D,Task,"Just a small screen "
A,Task,"That's a good idea . "
D,Minor,"with two "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"Some extra info . Feedback . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . I think that's a good idea as well . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But I dunno if that would "
A,Other,"As the small screen . "
D,Task,"that would fit into the costs . "
A,Other,"Extra button info . "
A,Task,"I think that should be possible as well . "
A,Elicit,"Um let's see what did we say . Mm . More . "
A,Task,"Should be fancy to comm fancy design comm easy to learn . "
A,Task,"Few buttons comm we talked about that . Docking station comm L_C_D_ . Um general functions "
A,Minor,"Yeah . 'Kay . "
A,Task,"And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well comm "
A,Task,"because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . "
A,Task,"So that doesn't really matter . "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"I think we nee "
D,Task,"I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters . "
A,Task,"Uh let's um specify the target group . "
A,Elicit,"Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . "
A,Task,"Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty comm maybe . "
B,Other,"Mm . Yeah . "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Uh what do we want ? "
D,Minor,"I think "
A,Task,"If we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people comm we can "
A,Task,"target the real elderly people . "
D,Minor,"I think that would be a "
D,Task,"If we should do something like that it would be a comm I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And I think comm I think there would be a good market for it . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"that's the "
D,Task,"If we're able to really bring an innovative product . "
A,Elicit,"Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example . "
D,Task,"Yeah the really "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"But I'd have to look into that a little more . "
A,Other,"Sixty . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And different cultures . Are we "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I don't think they have different television sets uh "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"in uh every country . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"'Cause "
A,Task,"We've got five minutes left just now . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Other,"'Kay . "
D,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Small warning . "
D,Task,"And with uh the little screen in it comm which explains the buttons . You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to "
A,Minor,"Should "
D,Task,"adapt it to different cultures . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"In different languages comm you know . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"or you have to put a language button in it comm "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"but that will be a bit unnecessary I think . "
B,Task,"No . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's better to put it on different markets with it all . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
A,Task,"that's the the target . "
A,Task,"Uh then a few small things . "
A,Minor,"Uh okay . "
A,Task,"I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . "
A,Task,"Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept comm "
A,Task,"User Interface Designer the user interface concept comm "
A,Task,"and the trend-watching . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group comm uh requirements comm and the trends which are uh going on . "
A,Task,"And uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Other,"I thank you for this meeting . "
A,Task,"And I think we have a lunch-break now . "
D,Task,"That's good . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"that's a good thing . "
