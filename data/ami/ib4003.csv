Speaker,DialogAct,Text
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"And don't forget the "
D,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
A,Other,"Um comm so hi everyone . "
A,Other,"Thanks for coming to this meeting . "
A,Task,"Um well as you all know the topic of this morning's meeting is uh the fact that we're moving and we are going to get more space . "
A,Task,"So that's a very good piece of news . "
A,Task,"Uh but we also have to find out how we use this space . "
A,Other,"So um if you want comm I'll just give a brief overview of what's happening "
A,Task,"and then we can uh talk about comm well comm arranging these new uh the new office space . "
A,Other,"So um in case you haven't seen the the documents uh let me just uh show you very briefly the the configuration of the the space . "
A,Task,"So um well comm there is nothing much to say . "
A,Task,"Well you know how many of us are are present "
A,Task,"and you know that we are um a bit tight actually in our present location . "
A,Task,"Uh that's why actually the university finally um allocated us this uh this part of uh the Unimail building . "
A,Task,"So it's at the sixth floor . "
A,Task,"And it's uh sort of contiguous rooms as you you can all see from uh from here . "
A,Task,"Um so the the the one P_ comm two P_ comm three P_ means the the number of persons . "
A,Task,"As you can see we have several corridor um with a number of uh of uh of rooms comm of one person rooms comm two person room and and three person rooms . "
A,Task,"Um actually I think Agnes did this nice drawing "
A,Task,"so she even put the the view comm "
A,Task,"so we have the old town on one side comm "
A,Task,"and the mountains on the other two sides . "
A,Task,"Uh we have some bathrooms for us . "
A,Task,"Uh and a courtyard which actually means a sort of uh shaft comm "
A,Task,"because uh the court is uh down at uh the first floor . "
D,Other,"Andre comm just comm yeah comm just a a clarification question comm "
D,Elicit,"are they number of people per room indicated strict comm or can we play around with ? "
D,Elicit,"I mean if there are two people comm is it really that you can't put three or uh two and a half or uh "
D,Elicit,"how how was it calculated ? "
A,Task,"Well comm it's a bit difficult to say comm "
A,Task,"because um in fact we have some constraints in terms of furniture . "
A,Task,"Uh they are here . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"So um well comm your your person Your your question actually is answered maybe by the third item . "
A,Task,"So each person should get um comm well comm it's a sort of desk comm "
A,Task,"it's made of two pieces "
A,Task,"and it looks like a corner . "
A,Task,"With comm of course comm a chair . "
A,Task,"Uh a filing cabinet that goes under the desk uh "
A,Task,"and comm well comm we can put hanging shelves over the the desks . "
A,Task,"So I'm not really sure it's possible to get three um three desks in a two person office . "
A,Task,"But um we could try . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"What's What should be said here comm "
A,Minor,"I don't know if comm well comm you "
A,Other,"I I will maybe distribute now documents if you don't have them . "
A,Task,"Maybe it's easier . "
A,Elicit,"Do you need something comm Martin ? "
D,Task,"I have everything . "
A,Other,"Um comm I can keep this for you . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Minor,"Uh so it's it's "
C,Task,"I have a copy . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"you have a copy comm Susan . "
A,Task,"You too David comm I think . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So in fact there are more places than people comm "
A,Task,"so we won't be that constrained . "
A,Task,"Uh as you know some of us and some of you here actually comm Martin and David are part-time . "
A,Task,"So it it's for the moment quite comfortable . "
A,Task,"Normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for comm you know comm temporary people coming to work on uh on projects . "
D,Elicit,"Are you sure of that ? "
A,Task,"Uh yeah comm I uh yeah comm "
A,Task,"I counted so we have um fifteen pers physical persons "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and about uh sixteen comm I think comm uh persons oh comm actually comm eighteen persons in the offices . "
C,Other,"Two "
C,Other,"Six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but counting the rea the the reading room . "
A,Task,"Exactly comm "
A,Task,"it so one of the issues uh here comm it's probably not on the slides comm is that we would like to have uh comm unlike what had until now comm a lounge or reading room uh in one of the the offices . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So in one of the rooms . "
C,Elicit,"Do we really need that ? "
A,Task,"Um comm I think quite a lot of people e expressed the need for that . "
A,Task,"So if we could do it comm then I think it would be much nicer . "
A,Minor,"Um let me also uh st say something "
D,Task,"And Susan comm don't forget the time we spend to for discussions about that room comm "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"so you should be able to valorize this if possible . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I I think so . "
D,Task,"But I still agree with you that the b the we are not so we are not so large comm as far as space is concerned . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh because fifteen people to put in there eighteen positions comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"so uh to the best uh if you take uh two people room for the reading room comm then you have uh sixteen places . Mm . "
A,Task,"Well comm sixteen slots for fifteen people . "
A,Task,"So it's still should be feasible . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that that also means that the growth will be zero . "
A,Minor,"That's "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think that's quite important to manage some space . "
A,Task,"Maybe we can think of comm yeah comm some two or three comm yeah comm for visiting people . "
D,Task,"Visiting visiti visiting researchers comm "
D,Task,"students coming for exchange students et cetera . "
A,Task,"Correct . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Okay comm so let me finish with the the constraints which are almost done . "
A,Task,"So we also need to to find the a spot for the photocopier comm the fax machine comm and the printer . "
A,Task,"The fax comm you know comm is very small comm "
A,Task,"but um the photocopier is quite huge comm "
A,Task,"and the printer is uh well ab this size . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"the offices comes with white boards . "
A,Task,"Not very uh very important . "
A,Task,"Uh the furniture that w each each person has "
A,Task,"and uh you have a list of people . "
A,Task,"So the thing uh you you ought to know is that we're not the only ones that w we're thin that that are thinking about uh for well comm about putting people i in these rooms . "
A,Task,"Um there is another group that is also having discussions . "
A,Task,"So the idea is that today we'll just try to f start seeing the main constraints "
A,Task,"and then you have time to to go and think about it uh "
A,Task,"ask the people you know comm your assistants comm for instance comm "
A,Task,"and at the next meeting we'll try to to come with one solution . "
A,Task,"Uh comm the other group will also propose a solution "
A,Task,"and then there will be another negotiation . "
C,Elicit,"And if we don't get this space then what happens ? "
A,Elicit,"Uh if i if we don't get these ? "
C,Task,"These comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Um comm well basically they are promised to us so uh "
D,Task,"We j we stay where we are . "
A,Elicit,"Do do you think there are chances that they take from us one of the rooms or uh "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm I I I think it's uh Uh comm yeah . "
D,Task,"No the the the chances might be that there are more people to put in that space . "
A,Task,"Yeah i yeah comm "
A,Task,"that's one of the the problems . "
A,Task,"I think maybe we should take this into account "
A,Task,"and maybe think of some of the bigger rooms with four people comm "
A,Task,"one being temporary or or part-time . "
A,Task,"Um okay comm so maybe we could try to to see now what would be the main options . "
A,Task,"Say the general uh comm well comm arrangement options . "
A,Task,"Do you think that we should put people comm say comm according to projects for instance ? "
A,Task,"In in the table that um that we have comm uh we also have the uh uh the p the main projects on which the people are working . "
A,Minor,"So how "
D,Other,"Andre comm sorry for interrupting comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"but uh one again clarification question comm "
D,Elicit,"what is the real margin of manoeuvre that we have for these discussions comm "
D,Task,"because uh at least we are half per cent uh fifty per cent of from E_P_F_L_ "
D,Task,"and uh sometimes you have meetings where w y the the decision is already taken comm "
D,Task,"so uh um you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things comm "
D,Elicit,"so what what will be the impact of what we will come out come up with ? "
A,Task,"Oh comm actually what is fixed is the n the number of rooms . "
A,Task,"This we cannot really change . "
A,Task,"I mean at least not us comm "
A,Task,"it would be much more difficult to get another another room for instance . "
A,Task,"But what is absolutely n not fixed is the arrangement of the people in the rooms . "
A,Task,"So basically we are all the permutations are possible at the moment . "
D,Minor,"So comm another way of a "
D,Elicit,"Another way of asking the question comm is there any other group already working on uh on the how this should be uh should be allocated ? "
D,Elicit,"Or are we the the one that is supposed to do the p the the p position for it ? "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Well comm what we are looking for is a solution that suits everyone "
A,Task,"and that makes the maximum of people happy . "
A,Task,"So uh the other group is comm uh I don't think we have to see them as competitors comm "
A,Task,"but they are just trying to to find another local optimum . "
A,Minor,"Or l uh "
D,Elicit,"But wha why why don't they have any representative here . "
D,Minor,"I mean "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"why didn't we have a meeting together ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Uh comm they have another group "
D,Elicit,"why do we do it separately ? "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"and then uh uh uh Andre and Agnes will discuss about it with . "
B,Task,"You are the rep representative of this group actually . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah uh uh we Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I I think that's "
A,Task,"Yeah comm there is no real competition between the two comm "
A,Task,"but we'll just try to find at least two solutions and see how how close they are comm actually . "
A,Task,"It's it's I think well the m the people who who decided this thought it was the best solution to comm mm well comm you know comm find two two kinds of opinions . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Well comm we could have been eight h sitting around here and and talking comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"but I think it's it's more difficult . "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"but you know that that's a standard thing . "
D,Minor,"It's "
D,Task,"Suppose that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we don't know about that comm "
D,Task,"we'll put them put her or him somewhere else comm "
D,Task,"then we will do plenty of work for nothing comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"because we'll not have this constraint . "
D,Task,"We'll not be aware of this constraint . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"Exactly comm "
A,Minor,"I think "
A,Task,"So so today the goal is not to to find the solution today comm but to set some constraints "
D,Minor,"Oh comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"and then go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences . "
A,Task,"Obviously we won't be able to accommodate all the the preferences comm "
A,Task,"but at least we'll find the most uh the most important ones . "
C,Task,"Well comm certainly we have to ask uh Pierrette and uh and Maggie comm "
A,Minor,"P s I think "
C,Task,"since they're not here comm "
C,Task,"because they also have a lot of students that they have to see as we do comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and so that's another consideration comm too . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think so that's one of the things I think we know that they have students comm "
A,Task,"we don't know exactly if they prefer for instance to be alone comm or to well comm to be with their assistant comm or even with another person working on the project . "
A,Task,"So that would have been maybe comm yeah comm another solution is to ask everyone to provide uh an arrangement comm "
A,Task,"but uh I think that's a bit uh a bit hard then to to work out . "
A,Task,"Um so since all of you have a copy of the uh comm well comm of the drawing comm I think for the next time comm m maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with uh names on it . "
A,Task,"But let us try to see today whether we prefer to organise people comm say comm by projects or just professor and assistant . "
A,Elicit,"So what would be f comm say comm first your preferences comm "
A,Minor,"since "
A,Task,"Let's let's start with us comm maybe today . "
A,Elicit,"Um what do you think about it ? "
A,Elicit,"Would you prefer to be alone comm "
A,Elicit,"would you prefer to be with your assistant . "
A,Elicit,"You who are part-time comm do you think you can come here on a very w well regular schedule or is it part-time comm but variable during the week ? "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Other,"Yeah uh comm okay uh comm "
B,Task,"me personally I would like to to to share the other peopl n uh the room with assistants "
B,Task,"as when you have problems of normal life comm like uh the printer doesn't work comm uh I don't want to ask this to my supervisor comm "
B,Task,"so it's better to to be with a with an assistant to share the room . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Elicit,"And since you're coming on the uh half-time comm do you think you will be able to group your presence here comm say Monday comm Tuesday and Wednesday morning comm or is it going to be m much more random ? "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"What uh I don't think it's a good idea to share uh t to ha to share the same desk . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh I still would like to have my drawers and these things . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think so too . "
A,Task,"Um so Martin comm you are also uh half-time and comm well comm the third person is Gisella . "
A,Task,"I think it's quite clear that mm each person should have their own desk and "
D,Task,"I agree with that . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"That's "
A,Task,"It's no no way we we could put two persons at the same desk . "
D,Task,"Whe whe where part-time is important is that it's n an overlo load on a room comm "
D,Task,"so um for sure if you have a part-time person comm it reduces the the ranges of time where too many people in the room . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I think grouping "
D,Other,"As far as I am concerned I probably might be able to have a kind of a regular presence here . "
D,Task,"Um comm the uh the thing that f in my case has to be taken into account is that I will have a lot of phone calls . "
D,Task,"So I'll be talking o o o over the phone all the time . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"Oh great . "
D,Minor,"So that's not necessary "
D,Minor,"Well comm it depends on "
D,Task,"I I have nothing against sharing a a an office with somebody . "
D,Task,"I d already did it before comm so "
D,Task,"and it was perfectly fine . "
D,Task,"It just has to be somebody who can work while somebody else is having phone calls in the in the room comm which is very d much dependent on people . "
D,Task,"Some people are not disturb at all by this . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Some people just can't work . "
A,Elicit,"Are you disturbed by the phone calls of other people ? "
D,Task,"I'm not . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"But uh and uh what might happen comm but it uh it will not be so heavy here uh at ISSCO is visitors . "
D,Task,"So that I will have more at E_P_F_L_ comm uh typically students coming in um or asking for things . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"As I'm not teaching here comm I'm teaching at E_P_F_L_ comm this should shouldn't be a such a big load . "
D,Task,"So for me it it will be essentially I will not be I will not be able to be silent in the room comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"because I will be communicating also through vocal means comm so "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Ye mm before um talking more about individual preferences comm is there any possibility comm what they have done in the uh faculty of law comm for example comm that they actually split rooms ? "
C,Task,"And so we would take uh uh one of the two people rooms and split it . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"And you would see that you would have the same size office comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but that would give the privacy . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Um insofar as in just about every other faculty in the building comm every professor has their own office . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And it's it's really it goes a bit far that uh we have to have this uh all this sharing uh . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"So one option and that but that we would need to ask about if we could uh split one of the rooms uh "
D,Task,"Do you go for boxes for instance ? "
D,Task,"In the in the bigger rooms where comm yeah You know like uh cubicles ? Yeah "
A,Task,"Like cubicles . "
C,Task,"That doesn't really solve it uh "
C,Task,"I mean there's there's really a difference to having to have your own "
D,Task,"You mean comm you really want to have walls . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"and sometimes you have uh you need to have private uh discussions with somebody or whatever comm so "
D,Task,"Four walls . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm sure sure . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm I I I will try to find out whether we can separate . "
A,Task,"I think for the moment the answer at least is no comm "
A,Task,"because um it's not only comm well comm making a wall comm but also b mm making a new door . "
A,Task,"So it's quite a lot of uh of work comm "
A,Other,"but uh I will try to find this out for the next time . "
A,Other,"Um comm so at least for the moment comm as you can see there are uh I can show them here on the screen . "
A,Task,"So there are these two rooms on the left that uh accommodate one person . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So at least some of the professors comm since you are four comm uh could could go uh well comm could take these uh these rooms . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And quite a lot of rooms with two persons . "
A,Elicit,"Uh how do you feel Susan about the professor sharing the room with her assistants or the one which is the most involved in in the teaching ? "
C,Task,"Well comm I I think it's uh really a matter of personal preference . "
C,Task,"As you know um comm I prefer to have uh my own office . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Um comm I also have uh a lot of phone calls "
C,Task,"and y you know comm have to see people comm "
C,Task,"and with the other work that I'm doing with the rectorate uh comm that is really confidential information that I'm treating . So I That I have to be really careful about too . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"But it's a personal preference uh . "
C,Task,"Insofar as what we've had up until now comm both Maggie and Pierrette have been happy to share with others . "
C,Task,"So I mean I think that we should still check with them "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I fully agree with that . "
D,Task,"That's uh it's much easier to me to uh to foresee having two people of the same position sharing a room comm than uh "
C,Task,"Well comm not sharing with each other . "
C,Task,"They each share with an assistant . "
D,Other,"Oh sharing with their students . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Oh sorry comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"because but that that's uh it's it's tricky because of confidentiality reasons comm as you said . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you you you are discussing a budget on the on the project comm you over the phone typically "
D,Task,"you don't necessary want to have somebody who will be dependent on that budget being part of the discussion comm so "
C,Task,"Paid on that "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's um that's true . "
A,Minor,"Um comm okay . "
A,Task,"Um comm maybe we could s look a bit at the projects . "
A,Elicit,"Do you think it's a good idea to put together in the same room as much as possible people from the same project comm "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"since they talk quite a lot of to each other ? "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"because pro project doesn't last in time . "
D,Task,"They will change . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
D,Minor,"That's what "
D,Task,"The only thing that will not or that will change only progressively in time is the status of the people . Mm . "
A,Task,"Well comm yeah comm "
A,Task,"and some of the P_H_D_ students will hopefully finish their P_H_D_ at some point . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"they will promote that . "
D,Minor,"But still comm th some things Well comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm and also some of our the people mentioned here are working on more than one project too . So "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"For example comm uh Marianne de uh comm she's also working with me on the virtual campus project comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"so she "
A,Other,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"that one wasn't mentioned comm "
C,Task,"but I'm not saying that I necessarily want to be with her in the office comm "
A,Other,"Okay comm yeah . "
C,Task,"but uh it's just to say people are working on uh sometimes more than one project uh "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"If if it if i if projects are what you have in mind comm I think that uh meeting room is the the tool for that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"If you need to have people in a projects talking together comm they just have a meeting room "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"if it's not too far away then then it's a very good good practice . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well comm actually comm so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room comm "
A,Task,"but there are also more formal meeting rooms available in in the building comm as we now know . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"That's why I was quite receptive to uh Susan's remark at the beginning is "
D,Task,"I wouldn't formulate it in a such a an extreme way as comm do we really need the lounge ? "
D,Task,"But uh I would p probably formulate it in the way that uh comm do we want to have only a lounge or s something that can be used only as a reading room ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Because because meeting rooms to me are very important tools to do uh collaborative work . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"But on the other hand we also have to relax comm so that's "
A,Minor,"So I think we need a "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and and I think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge comm "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Well comm yeah comm "
A,Task,"which is a whole other topic . "
C,Task,"we'll skip that for now . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"No I d "
C,Task,"um the lounge okay comm "
C,Task,"but I think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have um uh visitors for any length of time comm so they actually have a place to work . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"'Cause that's really my one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that it's it pr provides no possible possibilities of expansion . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"And this will happen . "
A,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"I mean you can't you can't prevent having visitors . "
D,Task,"And you shouldn't . "
C,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
C,Task,"you want to have visitors . Yeah . "
A,Task,"for the moment actually I think only one slot would be fully free . "
A,Minor,"Uh that is Yeah . "
D,Task,"Which for for fifteen people it's not enough . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"I mean uh "
A,Task,"that means one visitor at a time . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Or one intern . "
D,Minor,"Yeah it's "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm that's Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"We have we have four professors here and and and two researchers . "
B,Minor,"It's "
B,Task,"It's funny that uh we move to another building because we run out of uh space and we will have the same problem . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Task,"but we have more space here than what we currently have comm "
B,Other,"Ah okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"so it's at least some "
A,Task,"it's already in progress . "
D,Task,"It's bad it's bad . "
A,Minor,"And you're you're working "
A,Minor,"Uh I think comm yeah comm w Okay comm "
A,Other,"so one of the things I have to do for the next time is fin find out about the separations between rooms and "
D,Task,"Because this is really related with security uh regulation as well . "
D,Task,"I mean you can't just put walls in in rooms without any specific authoris Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think it's quite a heavy transformation of the building . "
D,Task,"Uh it's not necessary heavy in terms of work . "
D,Task,"It's heavy in terms of administrative authorisation . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"And okay comm "
D,Task,"At least at E_P_F_L_ . "
A,Other,"I'll try to find out . "
A,Task,"And the other question is comm can we squeeze maybe four people in the uh or at least four places in the three three P_ room ? "
D,Task,"I think so . "
D,Task,"If you organise the desks in a in a intelligent way . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"hopefully visitors don't need as much say filing space comm or um "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm right comm that's the point . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm they don't have that many papers . "
A,Minor,"Uh okay . "
A,Task,"So that's uh I have to to ask comm "
A,Elicit,"so you don't really feel um very strongly attached to this uh grouping by projects idea ? "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Um "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"because they can share their ideas across the project comm yeah comm I would say . "
D,Task,"Coffee machines are that made for that . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm exactly . "
B,Task,"But uh usually comm whe when new assistants come comm they would like to share the room with someone that knows uh l uh it's related with the project comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"so he can "
D,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"that's that's proximity doesn't play a big role there . "
D,Minor,"We can discuss with people that "
A,Task,"Yeah comm they they can change . "
D,Task,"the the space is very small comm "
D,Minor,"I mean comm altogether it's "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"And uh you don't y you don't need to discuss about the projects comm "
B,Minor,"No comm okay . "
D,Task,"you f more need about th to discuss about where is the printer comm how do I get furniture comm I'm I don't have a a pencil comm where is the the box with the pencils comm and so on . "
D,Task,"This is not project related . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"and if you look now at their uh the the current division of the offices comm for example comm uh Bruno and Agnes are sharing an office "
C,Task,"and they're working on totally different projects "
C,Task,"and and they're they're just fine with that . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think that's that's going to be one of the the main things we'll have to ask is whether people have strong preferences either in staying with someone or in uh not staying . "
A,Elicit,"Um comm are you aware f of any strong constraints right now ? "
C,Task,"Well comm there there were comm "
C,Task,"but they sort of disappeared as of October when the no smoking rule came in comm "
C,Task,"because before we were grouping the smokers "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
C,Task,"and now that there's no smoking comm uh I guess that's not very important option comm though "
A,Task,"Okay comm yeah comm that's true . "
A,Task,"So smoking is now um no longer a constraint . "
C,Task,"Well comm except for that maybe you don't even want anybody smoking on your balcony comm so "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Is it allowed to smoke inside an office comm if it's a one person "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No comm not any more . "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"n it's in in principle it's a it's a no smoking building . "
D,Task,"It's non-smoking campus . "
C,Task,"You can smoke outside . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So you can go outside onto the balcony to smoke . "
D,Elicit,"Not even in the cafeteria ? "
C,Task,"Not even in the cafeteria . "
D,Elicit,"Downstairs ? "
C,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Full no smoking building for all of the six thousand students . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's the new regulation . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Wow . "
D,Task,"On the roof maybe . "
A,Task,"Uh on the balcony comm actually . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yep . "
D,Other,"The balcony comm okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Normally . "
C,Task,"There is the there's that terrace . "
D,Minor,"But Andre comm uh just a "
B,Task,"Wow comm "
B,Elicit,"there there's no place in inside the building ? "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Wow comm "
B,Task,"E_T_P_F_L_ is a c it's a non-smoking campus comm "
B,Task,"but there are some places tha "
D,Task,"Still some places where smokers can survive . "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
D,Other,"But Andre comm just a comment abou about your your previous uh request . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I I don't think that anyone will provide you information such as who doesn't want to be with whom . "
D,Task,"That's a typical uh output of ex uh research in expert systems . "
D,Task,"These are the rules that you never get . "
D,Task,"But uh you can get them through a proposal . "
C,Task,"The other way . "
D,Task,"So you propose a set-up comm where people are with other peoples "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and they will find politically correct ways to tell you that uh they don't want to have a view on the mountains comm but they prefer to have view on the old town comm "
D,Task,"so they would be in the toilets . "
A,Task,"O on the toilets or "
D,Task,"They would um p prefer to be in another room . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"No comm "
C,Task,"we we do have one constraint that's difficult comm which is uh Gisella comm "
C,Task,"because when she's there she's very noisy . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"She's on the phone a lot "
D,Task,"But that's a sec s that's the admin that's the admin uh so it's part of the work . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"It's just it's by "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's by nat uh by the nature of her work that uh a lot of it is communication . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yes comm Martin said also for him "
A,Task,"and comm yeah comm especially for her . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Yeah the in she's the interface . So "
D,Task,"And that that's a problem comm you're right comm "
D,Task,"because because we don't have a one person we d we don't have enough one person rooms for uh accommodating the uh the admin place . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Elicit,"And uh if you put two person persons or three persons for the admin space comm who who who else would you put in there ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Because we don't have any assistant manager "
D,Task,"or we don't have We have only one half part half-time uh admin "
D,Task,"and no other non-researcher positions comm if I'm not mistaken . "
D,Task,"And this is really a piece of a problem . "
A,Minor,"Yep . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Maybe you could put some visitors comm but um I know . It's not very uh realistic in a in a in an admin room comm but uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm I think "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I think putting Gisella with the other admin of the school is not an option comm "
A,Task,"because we weren't offered "
C,Task,"I think that's a excellent idea . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it would be nice comm "
C,Task,"Why don't we ask about that ? "
A,Minor,"but uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm because You can't put a researcher there . "
A,Other,"Okay comm I'll try to find out comm "
A,Minor,"but uh "
D,Minor,"That's just "
D,Task,"Either you lose one position or you find another admin or assistant manager . "
A,Minor,"I th "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean there is certainly enough space uh down the hall comm "
C,Task,"wi if all of those uh uh offices that are comm where half of them are also half time comm and they're very under-used . So um "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we'll try comm "
A,Task,"but all these comm yeah comm are say sort of difficult questions because they involve changing also the offices of the school "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"and comm you know comm people just don't wanna change in general . "
A,Task,"Um comm let's see comm maybe we can find some temporary well comm at least a proposal for Gisella . "
A,Task,"So comm since the one-person rooms are quite comm well comm sort of um desired by a lot of people comm she should probably "
D,Task,"No that's not sure that's not sure . "
A,Minor,"No comm y Yeah . Okay . "
D,Task,"Uh the there are To me there are two options possible "
D,Task,"is either you we can take one of the one person rooms for the admin comm "
D,Task,"because some of comm typically comm the professors have good reasons for sharing . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Sharing either with a colleague or sharing uh with some of their uh one of their P_H_D_ students . "
D,Task,"In that case it's it's realistic . "
D,Task,"Then we could very very simply uh allocate the one pers one of the one person rooms for the admin . "
D,Task,"And that would solve the problem . "
D,Task,"The other thing is to take a two person room for the admin . "
D,Task,"That could be the one uh close to the uh close to the here in the centre so uh the "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm the the middle one here ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But tha No no no comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"the other one comm the the one op Yeah comm here comm this one . "
A,Task,"This one . Okay . "
D,Task,"But then uh that the the question of what do we do with the second position there remains fully open . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So I would be I would be more of the opinion to to see whether it's it's so evident that comm let's say the at least the two full full-time professors that are here on the list comm we have one here comm but uh Maggie is is not present . If they really Yeah comm and Pierrette . If if if because of personal preferences they would be happy with a two person room comm which might or might not be the case . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And Pierrette too . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah comm well "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I mean it's it's certainly not uh something that we should impose comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"but we can ask . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm because in this case comm yeah comm Gisella could take one of the the two person rooms "
A,Task,"and the other place would be for some kind of visitor comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but that's not realistic either . "
A,Minor,"that "
D,Task,"I mean comm you have you have a fore foreign researcher coming visiting you and you will put put him in the admin office ? "
A,Minor,"I or "
A,Other,"Ah . Okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Uh you'll not do that . "
D,Task,"I mean uh comm maybe you can do that with an exchange student comm that's "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"or an intern . "
C,Task,"with with younger people comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"But you can't take a senior visitor and uh him in the in the secretary . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"No . "
C,Other,"So we we invite invite and then we say comm okay you can sit with Gisella . "
D,Other,"Uh you're here . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay so this sets a bit the stage for uh for Gisella then . "
A,Task,"Uh yeah we'll try to to find out . "
A,Task,"Um comm actually comm yeah comm maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors at the at the school actually share their office with their assistant . "
A,Task,"So b it looks like sort of an implicit tradition . "
C,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Maybe not to be followed . "
D,Minor,"As Susan said comm p "
C,Task,"Except for in every other faculty . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Yeah ? "
D,Elicit,"Is that so ? "
C,Task,"Yes comm it is so . "
D,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Every other faculty as far as I have seen their offices and the people that I know and that's in um in law comm uh socio-economics comm uh okay ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"It's a They all have their own office . "
C,Task,"I mean in in the in the law faculty they're at best there half time . "
D,Minor,"No no comm that's it . "
D,Task,"As we said comm it's it's really a matter of personal preference comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"it cannot be something else . "
D,Task,"It cannot be imposed for sure . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"It's uh "
A,Task,"Um comm okay so I think Well comm this sets a bit uh the stage . "
A,Minor,"Uh could we try So could you try please to uh "
A,Elicit,"Do you want an extra uh piece of paper ? "
A,Task,"Maybe try to comm well comm think on your own and then talk a little bit just to the people around you . "
D,Minor,"job . "
D,Task,"Again uh uh um comm Andre comm I think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for our for ourselves . "
D,Task,"I can tell you according to what I know now where I would like or would be ready to be comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"but I really don't see how I could decide for uh Maggie or Pierrette or whoever else on the list comm that they should be there . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No the point was to try to comm well comm just talk to them comm to David comm or "
C,Task,"We're gonna have to . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm b why why couldn't we do like couldn't we do it like for for the the set-up of meetings . "
D,Minor,"You you "
D,Task,"everyone received that and uh should provide Yeah comm I would like to be here . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"And then you will have this multi-constraint problem "
D,Task,"and uh you work during two hours and you come up with the optimal solution . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So w w w will you ask people just for their place or also for the other people's place ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I would I would ask for their place . "
D,Task,"I mean that's that's that's the important thing you want to know . "
A,Minor,"Because "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Minor,"Well comm but that's "
B,Elicit,"W what abou what about the the the cafeteria ? "
B,Task,"I mean comm we are going to purchase a cafeteria with a projector and all this altogether or "
D,Task,"Uh it's a reading room . "
B,Task,"Reading room comm yeah . "
B,Task,"It's altogether . "
D,Task,"Reading room comm it's not a cafeteria . "
B,Minor,"So in the living room "
D,Task,"But that that's an open question "
D,Task,"whether it's a it's a it's a it "
D,Task,"At the origin it was supposed to be a f pure reading room for relaxing comm uh reading the newspapers comm et cetera comm et cetera . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Uh there has been a very long discussion about that . "
D,Task,"I stinct uh this discussion is still vivid comm that some of the people comm I bel belong to these people comm would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure comm but also meeting room if necessary . "
D,Task,"Or comm as uh Susan said comm a room an emergency room where you can put uh some visitors in a decent environment for for for for work comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"because you don't have any other place to do it . "
D,Task,"But that's that's really an open discussion "
D,Task,"and that d I think no decision comm no final decision has been taken about that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm th then "
A,Task,"Okay then for the next time comm um try to come up either with your own preferences comm "
A,Task,"that's quite easy probably to state now that you know the constraints comm "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"or if you can poll a little bit the people around you comm "
A,Minor,"that would be I mean comm even "
D,Task,"The one that I don't want to have in the next room ? "
A,Task,"Well comm just discuss i Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"for instance comm I mean "
A,Task,"No comm no comm "
A,Task,"I was thinking just ask people around you what they think about this . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And I think comm yeah comm it will be nice to to come with maybe a sketch of of these . "
A,Task,"If you can do slides comm it's even better comm "
A,Task,"but uh don't be that formal . "
A,Task,"And uh we'll try to at least build up one coherent proposal comm "
A,Task,"and we'll merge it with the other one when the other one uh is available . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Other,"I'll ask um uh Maggie and Pierrette uh if they have uh any preferences . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"That would be great . "
A,Task,"Oh comm great . "
D,Task,"That would be great . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . Perfect . "
D,Task,"C that that of course is one of the main well not main but one of the important features that we need to know about . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm since they're not at the meeting I think it's in out of courtesy we should first ask them . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"And I'll try to "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Elicit,"Bu I ju just before finishing uh comm I mean comm we have a cafeteria or we don't eat at all ? "
A,Minor,"Fine . "
D,Task,"We don't have cafeteria . "
A,Elicit,"What do you mean by cafeteria exactly ? "
C,Task,"He means reading room . "
B,Task,"A place n what mm uh we can take a coffee also . "
A,Minor,"What "
D,Task,"No comm there is no coffee in the reading room . "
B,Other,"No ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm w we can bring your coffee in the reading room comm "
D,Minor,"That was the wrong "
D,Task,"We we did not have any money for buying the coffee machines comm so "
A,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"So so since maybe comm you're a part-time here comm and part-ti part-time at E_P_F_L_ comm there are at least two um coffee machines in the building comm "
A,Task,"one at the third floor comm "
A,Task,"one at the first floor . "
B,Elicit,"But they close at five or ? "
A,Task,"And we can bring our coffee . "
A,Task,"No uh automatic uh coffee machines . "
B,Other,"Ah okay . "
C,Task,"No . Coffee machines . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm okay . "
A,Minor,"So uh yeah . But comm in "
C,Task,"No comm there's the cafeteria is downstairs comm "
B,Unlab,"Yeah comm yeah comm this . "
C,Task,"but they close at five . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"Five . "
B,Task,"Ah that's the main problem . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"but there's the two machines comm "
C,Task,"and they're uh the vending machines where you just put the money "
A,Task,"Yeah comm vending machines . "
C,Minor,"and and you can get "
D,Task,"And you can bring your coffee in the reading room . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm maybe this is not a very bad timing . "
A,Task,"Could we try to meet uh next Tuesday ? "
D,Other,"T to try the coffee ? "
C,Task,"Wait . "
A,Task,"Um comm next Tuesday maybe at t maybe a bit later ? "
A,Task,"Maybe at eleven o'clock ? "
D,Task,"Wait comm wai wai wai wait . "
C,Task,"Wait comm wait . "
D,Other,"Next Tuesday . "
C,Other,"Tuesday um "
A,Task,"Come on comm try try to be nice . "
D,Minor,"Uh comm well well well well comm "
D,Task,"not so easy comm eh ? "
A,Elicit,"Gi give me a reasonable date . "
B,Task,"Yes comm I ha I have no constraints comm so it's fine . "
C,Minor,"Ch "
C,Task,"Um we have the don't forget we have the other meeting the M_D_M_ meeting in the morning comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm for me it's a good timing . "
C,Task,"so it would have to be in the afternoon . "
A,Task,"Uh-huh comm okay . "
D,Task,"Next Tuesday we have a meeting comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Exactly . "
D,Minor,"That might be "
D,Elicit,"Where is the meeting ? "
D,Elicit,"It's Unimail ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so comm yeah yeah comm then it could be that "
C,Task,"At nine thirty comm "
C,Task,"but we could do we could have this meeting then in the afternoon . "
D,Task,"That yeah . "
D,Task,"That that would be great comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Nah ? "
D,Task,"because that would allow us not to move comm or not to travel twice . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Very well . "
C,Task,"Yep . Okay . Yeah . Okay . "
A,Task,"So about two o'clock ? "
A,Elicit,"Would that be okay ? "
A,Task,"After lunch . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm after lunch . Right . Yep . Okay . "
A,Task,"It's not a very demanding meeting comm so um "
A,Task,"Perfect . "
A,Other,"Um comm then let me close this . "
A,Other,"And uh good luck for your arrangement games . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
