Speaker,DialogAct,Text
A,Task,"Uh it fell off . "
A,Other,"One comm two comm three comm four comm "
A,Task,"yeah comm we're ready . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Welcome to this second meeting . "
A,Task,"Um it's now quarter after twelve "
A,Task,"and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting . "
A,Task,"This is a meeting on functional design . "
A,Other,"Um and I wanna welcome you all "
A,Other,"and thank you all for doing some research in between . "
A,Task,"Um I did took the minutes from the first meeting "
A,Other,"and I'll show them to you in a moment . "
A,Task,"Um I know each of you have a presentation "
A,Task,"and um in thinking about the forty minutes comm I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes comm "
A,Task,"um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more comm maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion comm "
A,Task,"because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements "
A,Task,"and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Minor,"Is this ap "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Other,"Oops . "
A,Elicit,"everybody agree with this ? "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done "
A,Task,"and as you can see it says we get to get lunch comm um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . "
A,Minor,"Um but uh now "
A,Other,"for the minutes of the first meeting . "
A,Other,"And go to that one . "
A,Task,"Um as you can see it was this earlier today . "
A,Task,"Um Kate comm Steph comm Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . "
A,Task,"I opened the meeting comm "
A,Task,"the product was developed uh and reviewed comm "
A,Task,"and we talked about the financial end of it . "
A,Task,"Um and it had some implications comm um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons comm bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . "
A,Task,"And we closed early "
A,Task,"so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting "
A,Elicit,"Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? "
A,Elicit,"Are they complete comm "
A,Elicit,"did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"Uh I think so comm "
A,Elicit,"Did I miss something ? "
B,Task,"we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present comm "
A,Task,"but yes comm we did comm "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures comm "
A,Task,"but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"as a group I think we've are they're accepting the minutes . "
D,Task,"Okay comm I accept the minutes . "
A,Minor,"And uh "
A,Other,"okay . "
D,Elicit,"Is that what we're supposed to say ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I do . "
A,Other,"Good . "
A,Task,"Um comm then we'll move to the three presentations . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Mm we need to move this . "
A,Elicit,"Who wants to go f first ? "
A,Task,"That's as far as it goes . "
C,Task,"Uh not really meant to touch those microphones . "
C,Task,"Oh it doesn't have any on comm "
C,Elicit,"does it ? "
C,Task,"That's fine . "
D,Other,"Excellent comm thank you . "
B,Minor,"Oy comm "
B,Task,"big loop under the table . "
A,Task,"She said we didn't need to screw it in . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay comm that looks good . "
A,Task,"It's doing its thing . "
A,Task,"There we are . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Other,"Thank you very much . Um . "
D,Task,"One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls "
D,Task,"and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device comm as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . "
D,Minor,"So um "
D,Other,"my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context "
D,Task,"and to think about menu functionality and current technology "
D,Task,"and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . "
D,Task,"Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now comm "
D,Task,"and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . "
D,Task,"And if we devote some energy into this comm I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction comm the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these comm "
D,Task,"I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . "
D,Task,"And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"again comm most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . "
D,Minor,"Um fifty percent "
D,Task,"I think of all these uh numbers the most important is "
D,Task,"fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . "
D,Minor,"And eighty percent of users comm "
D,Task,"and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television comm D_V_D_ comm stereo remote control users out there comm "
D,Task,"eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . "
B,Elicit,"Could can I ask where these figures come from comm "
B,Elicit,"is this market research we've "
D,Task,"Um it was market research "
D,Task,"and there were a hundred people in the room comm "
D,Task,"so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . "
A,Minor,"Now "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"in between comm as the Project Manager comm they sent me an email from the powers that be "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"um that teletext is outdated um "
A,Task,"and the internet is coming in as important comm "
A,Task,"but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ "
A,Task,"um with incorporating the corporate image comm colour and slogan . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"I think we can I I think we can really focus on this remote "
D,Task,"and and again bring the Real Reaction um brand in in "
D,Task,"and and get some positive marketing for our other tools comm even if we directly don't um advertise for the I go everywhere line . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"these market research uh uh questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Now "
D,Task,"the early adopters comm those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it comm "
D,Task,"the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities comm ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . "
D,Task,"Very interesting comm "
D,Task,"I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know comm the the designers comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"but ninety one percent comm fifteen to twenty five "
A,Elicit,"Is that a large enough target market to target it ? "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"I I I think especially in terms of growth comm I think this would be a very smart group to target . "
D,Task,"I mean s three quarters of the next age group comm twenty five to thirty five are interested comm "
D,Minor,"and uh with the technologies improving comm if we can get these uh "
A,Elicit,"In real numbers comm does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"To "
D,Task,"Um yes . "
A,Elicit,"Or eight million . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
D,Elicit,"But would you pay more "
D,Elicit,"and does it work "
D,Elicit,"and is it approachable "
D,Minor,"and and did I know that it was it was an "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"that's a that's a very good question . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included comm "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"but I think it's an interesting "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology . "
C,Task,"Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"Shall I go back ? "
C,Elicit,"on like how much more it would be "
C,Elicit,"and any comm you know comm existing examples comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Elicit,"and what reactions to them have been comm and that sort of thing . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . "
B,Other,"I expect an Industrial Designer should know that comm "
B,Elicit,"but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty comm um is that a lot or a little ? "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
D,Minor,"I mean "
D,Task,"I I I uh did not receive any information on that comm "
D,Task,"but I think the competition comm sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important comm "
D,Task,"because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen "
D,Task,"and and that wasn't responded to comm "
D,Task,"but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate comm "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Minor,"so it turns into something "
D,Task,"uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes "
D,Task,"where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray . "
D,Minor,"You know comm "
D,Minor,"it's I a and I think comm "
B,Other,"Sh surely he's in the wrong age group . "
D,Minor,"you know "
B,Other,"He must be w one of a s small population . "
D,Task,"No comm no comm "
D,Minor,"you "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Kate comm you're exactly right there . "
D,Task,"But I think the key is to get the early adopters comm people who are familiar with technology "
D,Minor,"and and uh they'll be "
A,Task,"But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen comm "
D,Task,"Uh comm mm . "
A,Task,"that's looking at age groups . "
D,Task,"Exactly . I yes comm "
D,Task,"and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . Or comfortable comm "
A,Task,"Leap . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"you know comm um so "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"you had the other power channel . "
D,Task,"I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control "
D,Task,"and to be extraordinarily reductionist comm power comm channel comm volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers . "
D,Task,"And this is this is also supported by the market research . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Task,"That's my contribution . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"And we'll turn to the next presentation . "
A,Task,"I think she said we don't need to screw it in comm "
A,Task,"just stick it in . "
A,Elicit,"And then press comm what ? "
A,Task,"F F_N_ and F_ eight . "
A,Task,"Next to the control button on the bottom comm "
A,Task,"and then F_ eight at the top . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm press them . "
A,Task,"And then w be patient . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm here we go . "
A,Other,"Tada . "
B,Task,"And if you want it to go into slide show mode comm it's that little button there . "
C,Elicit,"Can I not just uh do each one in order ? "
B,Task,"I you can if you like comm "
B,Minor,"it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p "
A,Task,"There we are . Yay . "
C,Elicit,"That ? "
B,Task,"no "
B,Task,"that one comm that one there . "
C,Elicit,"That ? "
B,Task,"Left comm left a bit comm left a bit comm "
C,Elicit,"That ? "
B,Task,"that one comm yep . "
C,Minor,"Right comm "
C,Task,"technical functions design . "
C,Minor,"Uh well "
C,Task,"I think first off comm basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferencescommyeah . I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . "
C,Elicit,"And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition comm "
C,Task,"that's not something I'd thought about at all comm "
C,Task,"but it's also something we can discuss . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control comm if this is only gonna be a comm you know comm satellite comm cable comm T_V_ remote control . "
A,Task,"T_V_ only . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"these are two models of existing remote controls . "
C,Task,"Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control . "
A,Task,"Ugh . "
C,Task,"It has fast-forward comm stop comm play comm all relating to movies . "
C,Task,"It also has seems to have channel up and channel down comm "
C,Task,"which is which is more what you'd expect from a comm you know comm like a Sky or cable remote control "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . "
C,Task,"Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right comm "
C,Task,"which has it also has play comm stop and pause and everything comm "
C,Task,"I don't think we need them at all . "
C,Task,"I think we just need channel selection comm volume up comm volume down "
C,Task,"and I think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext comm but along the same lines comm access things on the screen . Uh "
C,Task,"not related to the internet one that you mentioned comm "
C,Task,"because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"it "
C,Task,"really exceed the requirements comm "
C,Task,"'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions comm "
C,Task,"which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"o "
C,Task,"I was thinking something some smooth comm sleek comm little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Any uh thing else you wanna add ? "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"But we could go back to the pictures of the uh comm what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls "
C,Task,"and possibly discuss what we think about them comm "
D,Minor,"Or if "
C,Task,"but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Let's hear what Kate has to say . "
C,Task,"Okay then . "
D,Task,"Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Whiteboard session . "
A,Task,"I think the white that one on the right is comm as well as less cluttered comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Definitely less cluttered "
C,Minor,"and I mean "
C,Minor,"but still it's "
C,Other,"Sorry "
A,Task,"It's there "
C,Minor,"I was just "
A,Minor,"but it's "
C,Other,"I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say . "
C,Task,"The the style of these is terrible . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I I I really think we need to uh "
C,Task,"not only possibly even materials comm like the type of plastic used comm but everything including size and shape of buttons comm positioning of buttons comm the actual shape of the hand-held device comm colours comm just every e yeah comm everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . "
D,Task,"The ergonomics comm the way it fits in your "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"But "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"that's that for now . "
B,Other,"Cheers . "
B,Task,"Mm comm I haven't actually got a display on my screen . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Still comm I'll do without that . "
B,Minor,"Okay um comm now "
B,Other,"I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid "
B,Other,"and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . "
B,Minor,"Um oh "
B,Task,"and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . "
B,Minor,"Um basically "
B,Task,"I've been doing a little bit of web-based research comm "
B,Task,"and if I had a design team comm I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . "
B,Task,"But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design "
B,Task,"that I'd like to discuss with you . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Other,"let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . "
B,Task,"It's for sending a message comm um typically um via infrared . "
B,Task,"And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source comm the user interface "
B,Minor,"and "
B,Task,"which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit "
B,Task,"that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses comm "
B,Task,"we turn that into a message comm "
B,Task,"um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . "
B,Minor,"Now "
B,Minor,"I would have hoped "
B,Task,"I think that's my only slide actually comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design comm "
B,Task,"but unfortunately the technology defeated me comm "
B,Other,"so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"we want an energy source "
B,Task,"which is there . "
B,Task,"And we've got to think about what that might be . "
B,Task,"Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . "
A,Minor,"Hmm-mm . "
B,Task,"Uh typically it would be a battery comm "
B,Elicit,"but I'm open to suggestions . "
B,Minor,"Um and "
B,Task,"then we have the the user interface . "
B,Other,"Oops . "
B,Task,"And the main components in there are the the th the chip "
B,Task,"that actually has the intelligence of the machine "
B,Task,"that translates button presses into a message comm "
B,Task,"which it then transfers to some sending mechanism comm "
B,Task,"which encodes it "
B,Task,"and sends the message to the receiver . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"those are the basic things "
B,Task,"that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . Okay . Right . "
A,Minor,"But those things as long as we can get those components comm "
A,Task,"the block comm that that rectangle for the user interface comm is where the user comes in "
A,Minor,"of "
A,Elicit,"what what does it look like ? "
A,Elicit,"What do the buttons look like ? "
A,Elicit,"Uh what does it feel like ? "
A,Task,"That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there comm "
A,Task,"but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source "
A,Elicit,"or um what if the chip comm for whatever reason comm breaks down after a certain amount of time comm do you just replace it ? "
A,Minor,"Um is there any um "
A,Task,"because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces comm like for D_V_D_s comm movies comm whatever . "
A,Elicit,"Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others comm in a different frequency or something ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"I may be wrong here comm "
B,Task,"but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . "
B,Task,"We're trying to sell four million of 'em comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"um that's that's comm you know comm that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . "
B,Task,"Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing comm "
B,Minor,"you just "
B,Task,"if it goes wrong you chuck it out comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"and that's why I'm a bit concerned . "
B,Task,"I like the idea of speech recognition comm that's a great idea comm "
B,Task,"but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit . "
D,Elicit,"Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? "
C,Other,"Whoop . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Because then "
C,Elicit,"Isn't that your job ? "
D,Task,"No comm "
A,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"the chip composer marketing . "
C,Other,"Oh right . "
D,Task,"Oh no comm "
D,Task,"the chip composer sender . "
A,Other,"Mm . What they cost . "
B,Task,"Um comm I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that comm if you're asking me comm "
D,Task,"I I don't believe I know comm um . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"the "
C,Task,"which is pretty much the same as these existing models comm "
C,Task,"just maybe a little bit more inspired comm "
D,Elicit,"Inspired ? "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"but basically just the same . "
C,Task,"Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is comm you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries "
C,Task,"which which is really not very efficient at all . "
C,Elicit,"Could it be possible to have uh comm you know comm like a rechargeable internal battery comm like comm well comm like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"You could you know comm you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours comm "
C,Task,"and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages comm "
C,Task,"and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries comm "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"that has another element comm "
C,Minor,"which are "
D,Task,"which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger comm then you then it has a place . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"You'd never need uh batteries "
C,Minor,"would y uh "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but it also has a place comm "
D,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . "
D,Task,"exactly . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . "
D,Task,"That's a really good idea . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"I uh think that's a very interesting idea comm "
B,Other,"but um I'm not a very good industrial designer "
B,Task,"and I don't know much about what these things cost . "
B,Other,"I'll do some research for the next meeting . "
D,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"it's better than my idea about solar comm probably . "
A,Other,"Uh yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"Depen "
C,Minor,"it is just so annoying how "
A,Task,"It would have to sor store up the energy "
D,Task,"Mm . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I guess . "
A,Task,"and then use it . "
A,Task,"Solar can do that . "
B,Task,"We may be talking quite heavy then . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"M yeah comm that would be too heavy "
A,Task,"and it'd cost too much . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"No comm "
C,Task,"but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm "
C,Task,"but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"and "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"you know f "
B,Elicit,"do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? "
D,Task,"Definitely comm "
D,Task,"'cause I'm thinking in terms of um uh the loss and breakage of um remotes comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home comm a um a nest comm a place to live comm "
C,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in . "
D,Task,"exactly . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So if you can dock it comm um you know comm you could s argue that this is "
A,Task,"And the dock could look very fancy "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
A,Task,"and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . "
C,Task,"Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"'Cause you are talking about another component comm like another piece of hardware . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? "
A,Task,"Pretty much comm "
A,Task,"so that we'd be looking for the younger end . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"I I brought up some "
D,Task,"exactly comm "
D,Task,"but I think you raised some good questions "
D,Elicit,"about are there enough of these people out there comm "
D,Elicit,"or are they making purchasing decisions ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"You know comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"these are the "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I was wondering that comm "
B,Task,"because I ag I agree that there there're people with uh how can I put it comm more money than sense "
B,Task,"and who are liable to buy something new comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm exactly . "
A,Task,"I I s usually put more money than brains . "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Oh oh oh "
D,Other,"I'll make a note of that comm Kate . "
D,Task,"Good comm good comment . "
B,Task,"Bu but what I was gonna say was comm although they they may be buying um comm you know comm personal music devices and all that comm "
B,Elicit,"are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? "
B,Task,"Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It might be good to know "
D,Elicit,"um uh who comm you know comm who's actually buying televisions "
D,Elicit,"and are we in a uh uh s region where people have more than one television in a home ? "
B,Task,"Mm . I think we've got a big hill to climb here comm "
B,Elicit,"haven't we ? "
B,Task,"I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? "
A,Task,"We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . "
B,Task,"Right comm good point . Yeah comm yeah okay comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm good point . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's probably more what it is . "
A,Elicit,"What would be a more efficient way of doing it ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them comm "
D,Task,"because we have the relationship with our own department comm "
D,Task,"but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Right . "
C,Task,"We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day comm "
C,Elicit,"are we ? "
A,Task,"Probably not . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . "
A,Task,"Our functions comm we've so far decided comm I think comm that power comm channel comm volume make it attractive . "
A,Task,"Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . "
A,Task,"It has to have big user-friendly buttons "
A,Task,"and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired "
A,Task,"that the current styles are just plain awful . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Do we need um let me "
A,Elicit,"Is that agreeable to everyone ? "
D,Minor,"Br actually comm um "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"the enter key "
D,Task,"I have a chart here that I didn't include . Um "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Do you want the gizmo ? "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"which might "
A,Elicit,"Throw some light on that . "
D,Minor,"Th "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Minor,"th those are "
D,Task,"felt like had a lot of charts . "
A,Task,"Um actually we're comm you know comm we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes comm "
A,Task,"so we have to get close to finishing . "
D,Task,"Okay comm "
D,Minor,"I I "
D,Task,"my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining . "
A,Other,"Ah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"Enter comm power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key . "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
D,Minor,"Again comm you know comm "
A,Elicit,"Is that okay with you ? "
D,Minor,"thinking of menus or "
C,Other,"Sorry comm "
C,Task,"I was miles away . "
A,Minor,"Would that "
B,Elicit,"H how does that work ? "
C,Task,"I was re I was reading the chart to be honest . "
B,Elicit,"How so so how does that work comm "
A,Other,"uh-huh . "
B,Elicit,"how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? "
D,Minor,"Um well "
D,Task,"if you're pressing enter comm the the thing would already be on comm "
D,Task,"and so maybe um when you press power comm initially it turns it on comm "
D,Task,"press power again and use that as an enter um "
D,Minor,"so you press power after you've "
A,Task,"Then you'd have to have an off te off key . "
D,Minor,"um well "
D,Task,"I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession comm "
B,Other,"Okay comm yep comm mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power comm and then that would make that choice . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"It's not getting a bit complicated ? "
B,Elicit,"Could granny do this comm "
D,Minor,"Well "
B,Elicit,"or are we just not aiming at granny ? "
D,Minor,"Or y "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Or something that has a a turning dial comm where at the far end is on or off . "
C,Elicit,"Who's got an iPod then ? "
D,Other,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I don't "
A,Other,"Mm . Okay . "
D,Other,"um I wish . "
D,Minor,"Anyway comm uh "
D,Task,"that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions people have made comm what's most important . "
D,Task,"It's definitely channel comm volume comm power . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"things like screen settings and audio settings comm I would generally do them on the actual television itself comm "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
C,Task,"like here you have a you know comm a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
C,Task,"I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so um I would say that they are definitely less relevant . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm well . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
D,Other,"Thanks for looking at that . "
A,Task,"I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"We don't wanna outsmart "
A,Task,"As you said comm you know comm don't make it too hard for the granny . "
A,Task,"I just joined that set last week . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Um first grandchild arrived . "
D,Other,"Congratulations . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Elicit,"Um so are we agreed then of those things ? "
A,Other,"And let's go back to agenda "
D,Minor,"D "
A,Other,"and hook me up . "
A,Task,"Mm . This oughta be fun . "
A,Task,"It probably won't go the first time comm "
A,Task,"it'll probably be like a g mess . "
A,Other,"Come on . "
A,Task,"Uh it lost it off here . Uh "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"you're fine . It's fine . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"it was up there comm "
A,Task,"but I couldn't see it down here . "
A,Task,"Mm . This time it should be both . "
A,Task,"There we go . "
B,Elicit,"How do you do that ? How do you make it do both ? "
A,Task,"Um you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to "
B,Other,"Ah okay comm "
A,Task,"five minutes to finish comm "
B,Task,"it toggles through comm "
A,Other,"thank you a lot for telling me . "
B,Other,"yeah . "
D,Task,"I think you have to cycle through . "
A,Task,"Um right comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"we're ready to close . "
A,Task,"Um will be completed q questionnaire comm "
A,Task,"um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um "
A,Task,"and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together . "
A,Task,"Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components comm "
A,Task,"for you comm Steph comm to do the user interface "
A,Task,"and for you the trend-watching . "
A,Task,"Um and each of us will get help from our coach . "
A,Elicit,"Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Sounds good . "
A,Task,"Then that's the end of this meeting . "
A,Elicit,"And I hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I think I went over the functions "
A,Task,"and wrote them down "
C,Other,"Alright comm "
A,Task,"and marked them . "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"that's fine then . "
A,Task,"Um that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Um and you'd mentioned I "
D,Other,"I was just gonna say comm "
D,Elicit,"could you reiterate the new project requirements comm "
D,Minor,"because it they were "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"it has to be for a T_V_ comm "
D,Minor,"just to keep myself "
A,Task,"Um the teletext is outdated comm "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"we're still in meeting comm "
B,Elicit,"aren't we ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"the internet is important comm "
D,Minor,"I think I've "
A,Task,"it's only to be for a T_V_ "
A,Task,"and it must include the corporate image comm colour and slogan um "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"which I think is more in the user uh range comm with Steph . "
