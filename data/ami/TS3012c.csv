C,Elicit,"Did you manage ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm sh not quite . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"You will see uh "
C,Minor,"Ah . "
C,Other,"Hello . "
A,Other,"Hello . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Minor,"are you d "
A,Elicit,"what were j you guys discussing ? "
C,Minor,"No comm "
C,Task,"just uh ask if if he could manage . "
D,Minor,"Woah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Did you find anything new ? "
D,Task,"Mm uh nothing special . Uh "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"I have a lot of new information . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm the for uh the trendy uh stuff . A little bit . "
A,Task,"Great comm great . "
A,Other,"Come on . . "
D,Other,"I uh now will show it . "
C,Other,"Hey comm "
C,Elicit,"everything alright . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I had just a little bit of time comm "
C,Elicit,"Did you manage ? "
B,Task,"so I hope it's something uh we can work with . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"What's uh here . "
B,Minor,"But "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I had the same . "
D,Task,"It just uh shuts itself down "
C,Elicit,"Do you have a lot of new information ? "
D,Minor,"and "
B,Other,"Hmm ? "
C,Elicit,"Do you have a lot of new information ? "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I heard that there was a new uh component speech recognition component comm "
D,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"which was pretty much up to standard comm "
C,Task,"That's true . "
A,Other,"And there we are . "
B,Task,"so we might use that "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Task,"I put that in my drawing comm "
B,Task,"but again I didn't not have that much time . "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"I have a lot of new information . "
A,Other,"What the f "
A,Other,"oh comm yeah uh . "
C,Task,"I have a complete list of uh everything that we can use comm all the components that all av available . "
A,Task,"It doesn't do what I want it "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"I have no "
B,Task,"that's just super . "
B,Minor,"Let me just "
C,Task,"I still don't have any finance information comm "
C,Task,"but at least we have a lot more to go on now "
D,Minor,". "
B,Minor,"uh "
A,Minor,"Okay fine comm "
A,Task,"that's too bad . "
B,Elicit,"You need to start it up first ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I have to start our "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"'Kay . Okay comm "
A,Task,"go again . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"second phase comm conceptual design . "
A,Elicit,"It's fine comm everybody knows what we're talking about . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
D,Other,"Yep . "
A,Other,"take you past the minutes of last meeting again . "
A,Task,"Again you get your three presentate to see what you came up with . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"too bad we don't have any finance information apparently . So that's too bad . "
A,Task,"So then we'll just have to d uh have to go on comm you know comm the information that we have to make the make final decisions on uh on a conceptual design . "
A,Minor,"So Here we go . Anyway comm "
A,Task,"last w last w what discussed last time comm "
A,Task,"you all remember that comm that we have to keep the electronics size in mind . "
A,Task,"Same goes for you . "
A,Task,"We have to have an easy design with big buttons which are durable "
A,Task,"and there are people actually spen willing to spend money to do to get more features "
A,Task,"and uh among those features L_C_D_ screen and voice recognition are very popular . "
A,Task,"So we have to make a move on that area comm I guess . "
A,Minor,"S "
A,Task,"especially s when when the new uh component is applicable in our uh product comm we'll be fine . "
A,Minor,"Anyways comm well "
A,Task,"teletext wasn't important "
A,Task,"and that's what I took . "
A,Minor,"And the consumer comm "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"we aim for young consumers comm "
A,Task,"so that's fine . "
A,Minor,"And well actually we yeah comm "
A,Task,"we did need some more data on finances comm "
A,Task,"but w yeah we still don't have that apparently . "
D,Minor,"Mm uh-huh . "
A,Task,"That's too bad . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"we need to im de "
A,Task,"we are going to implement the beep and the flash thing to recover your remote . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"one of these interchangeable covers apparently which will make it a more fashionable product . "
A,Minor,"So anyway . "
A,Task,"Guess we'll have to do this after the after the you give your presentations . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"I'll just close this one now comm "
A,Minor,"and let's uh let's see comm . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Minor,"I bet "
B,Minor,"what t "
A,Task,"We have a lot to tell . "
A,Task,"You had a lot to go on . "
A,Minor,"So uh "
A,Task,"how about you go first . "
C,Task,"Yep comm that's right . "
B,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Oh okay . "
C,Other,"Let's see where my presentation is . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm um "
C,Task,"this I mentioned before . "
C,Task,"Every feature for our remote control needs to have their own operating electronic devices . "
C,Task,"We need to take care of that . "
C,Task,"Then warning comm uh there has to be a chip in our remote control . "
C,Task,"And the chip requirements uh needed for a normal button uh is just a simple chip comm "
C,Task,"uh scroll-wheel comm and L_C_D_ is an advanced . "
C,Task,"Of course this is more expensive than this . "
C,Task,"So we have to decide on that in a minute . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"The available uh components for energy are comm we have a basic battery comm a hand an uh dynamo comm like in uh old torches . "
C,Task,"We have a kin uh kinetic provision comm then you have to shake the remote control to get the energy . "
C,Task,"And we have solar cells . "
C,Task,"I suggest that we uh decide on that one uh immediately . "
C,Task,"Then I have all lists . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"My personal uh fav favourite is the kinetic provision "
D,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"because uh I ha "
A,Elicit,"Does it provide enough energy ? "
C,Task,"I think so comm yes . "
A,Elicit,"Also if if we were choose the the L_C_D_ option comm would it give enough energy "
C,Task,"Yes . Yes . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"that's the just assume it takes . "
C,Task,"Because I had the information uh you take uh the remote control comm you pick it up at least two times a day . "
C,Task,"So then it's already shaken and gives energy . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"I'm not sure if it's shaken enough comm "
B,Elicit,"Is that enough ? "
C,Minor,". Or "
A,Minor,"because "
B,Task,"Because I don't really see people shaking their remote control before using it . "
A,Task,"No comm I don't think so comm "
A,Task,"because uh watches can go on kinetic energy "
C,Minor,"Think "
A,Task,"because they move all the time . "
A,Minor,"But I'm sure t "
A,Task,"I mean remotes lie still I think like ninety nine percent of the time . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"So I don't think that's a really good "
A,Task,"the other alternative were solar cells . "
A,Task,"I don't think that's applicable "
C,Task,"Other options are solar cells comm hand dynamo and basic battery . "
A,Minor,"because "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"I thin why "
B,Minor,"And what does the hand dynamo "
A,Elicit,"why shouldn't we take a basic battery ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"oh comm sorry . "
D,Task,"A rechargeable maybe . "
C,Elicit,"Only basic battery ? "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"Why not ? "
C,Minor,"but I think this is not a r "
D,Minor,"Re rechargeable basi "
A,Task,"I mean everybody everybody knows how to use that . "
C,Minor,". "
A,Task,"It's it's common . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"and it's available everywhere . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So why sh mm I think better . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but I think this rules out our unit our rechargeable unit . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"This is really a really basic battery comm a normal battery . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"but it's "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"uh it wasn't it wasn't in the options comm a rechargeable m module actually . "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Minor,"Huh ? "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"that's uh . "
C,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Task,"Okay yeah comm "
D,Task,"Yep . Basic . "
A,Minor,"b you c "
A,Task,"of course you could place re re-chargeable batteries . "
A,Task,"But that's up to the consumer himself . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"but then we don't offer a re-chargement function . "
C,Task,"That's what it says . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Minor,"mm "
A,Task,"it's not in the list . "
A,Task,"So we cannot choose from it . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
A,Task,"Okay comm will just take regular batteries . "
C,Minor,"Alright . Right . Yep . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Next one is curving . "
C,Task,"Uh we can make a model that has one curve comm two or three . "
C,Minor,"And uh "
B,Elicit,"Curves being ? "
C,Task,"uh th uh the shape . "
C,Task,"Of course uh the more curves the more expensive . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Of the remote control itself comm "
C,Task,"Exactly . Yes . "
D,Minor,"But But It dep But "
B,Other,"okay . "
B,Task,"I was thinking along the line of one curve . "
B,Other,"I'll show that in my design . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we'll get back on that later . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"we'll get back to that . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Just "
C,Task,"Hmm . I think one curve is uh fine . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But what were the implications if you if put more curves it it's gets more expensive . "
D,Task,"Depends on the user . "
C,Task,"More expensive . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"More difficult to make . "
A,Elicit,"so I think with with the extras that we had there it's two curves I suppose . "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And I believe even that the r the number of options we have on putting things in it uh goes down with "
A,Other,"Also decreases comm okay . "
C,Task,"exactly . "
C,Task,"Material . I have to offer a plastic comm rubber comm wood or titanium . "
C,Task,"Uh if we choose plastic comm we cannot choose solar cells for energy . "
C,Task,"If we choose titanium comm uh we cannot use more than one curve . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"But we don't have that so fast . "
A,Other,"More than one curve comm uh yeah okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Minor,"I t "
A,Minor,"We'll just go uh "
B,Task,"I'd go for plastic "
B,Task,"because I have a couple of curves in my design . "
A,Minor,"'Cause it "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"I'm not sure . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Minor,"g "
B,Task,"let's just get back to that . "
A,Task,"We'll discuss that later . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"we have "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"so I think we can rule out um "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I'm not sure we can rule anything out . "
A,Task,"We'll do that when y when you get your design . "
C,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"But I think wood is not an option either . "
B,Task,"No comm wood's not an option . No . "
A,Task,"No comm wood i wood's not an option . "
A,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"it it's stylish comm "
A,Minor,"but we can "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"but you can change your covers anyway . "
D,Minor,"No . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"My personal thought was uh rubber "
C,Task,"because I had an email comm I believe it was from you comm uh f against falling . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"is it keep in mind that it it's it's uh it fal uh "
A,Task,"remote controls fall a lot on the ground . "
A,Task,"So you don't want it to break . "
A,Task,"So either have rubber edges "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"or a rubber remote control is very durable . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Uh "
A,Minor,"But "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Continue . "
B,Task,"but it doesn't have to be unbreakable comm "
D,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"because we do need to keep selling these thing "
A,Task,"Don't have to be un-breakable comm "
A,Minor,"it's p it's a "
A,Task,"it's not supposed to ju yeah comm break after one use . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm well "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I mean it they "
B,Task,"that that's definitely true . "
A,Task,"they fall a lot . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Mm . I think we have to decide on this anyway . "
C,Task,"Uh because if we make removeable covers comm it has to be one of those mat materials . "
C,Task,"We have no more than this . "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Because it "
B,Minor,"well comm "
B,Minor,"ru "
B,Elicit,"will rubber actually protect the remote control itself ? "
B,Minor,"Because it "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Minor,"you have for if you if "
A,Task,"for example if you take hard plastic . If it falls it might crack . "
A,Task,"And rubber uh kind of softens the fall . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but then you buy a new cover . "
B,Minor,"But rubber "
A,Task,"I'm not sure if it's the it's the entire cover you change . "
A,Task,"Uh comm it's could be . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Are are we focussi focussing on on the "
A,Minor,"You know what comm "
A,Minor,"th "
A,Task,"we're focusing very much on the covers now . "
A,Task,"I think it's just w now we're going for the basic design . "
D,Minor,"But But "
A,Task,"If we wanna expand our options comm f be fashionable comm then we can get changeable covers . "
A,Minor,"But I think the basic thing "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"let's just rule out wood for now "
A,Task,"and continue . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Not that "
D,Elicit,"but are we focussing on the uh younger people or the elder people ? "
A,Task,"We're definitely focussing on the younger people comm "
D,Other,"Younger comm okay . Yeah comm that's okay . Nah comm that's "
A,Task,"'cause that was our main goal . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Other,"Then I proceed comm "
C,Task,"but I need to know after this meeting . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Okay okay comm we will . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Interface comm uh I have four things to offer comm "
C,Minor,"pu "
C,Task,"uh normal push-buttons of course . Um uh we have a lot of expertise on that one . We have a large history comm our company comm on push-buttons . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Scroll-wheels comm uh those can be pushed as well comm "
C,Task,"although that is more expensive . "
C,Task,"Um liquid crystal colour display "
C,Minor,"and um "
C,Elicit,"What is this ? "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"and if we use rubber comm I already mentioned that comm we can only use rubber buttons . "
C,Task,"So rubber can only match with rubber . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"Which one of those are we gonna use ? "
A,Task,"Evident . Yeah comm o of course we're gonna use . "
A,Task,"But I didn't I didn't go on the thought of a scroll-wheel actually . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Minor,"of cour "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Elicit,"I'm still deciding on what what what could you use it for . "
C,Minor,"No . "
A,Task,"Maybe for volume control . "
C,Task,"I think the channels . "
A,Task,"Channel comm I think that would be annoying "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"because it might accidentally scroll onto another channel . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think a push-button for channel would be better . "
C,Minor,". "
A,Minor,"I mean it "
A,Task,"for volume control it's it's a smoother motion comm "
C,Minor,"Huh ? "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Task,"you can just increase or decrease . "
A,Minor,"But not sure . For channels will be good . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . But "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but there is a "
B,Elicit,"is it really necessary "
B,Task,"'cause a normal push-button can do that job . "
A,Task,"I don't think so . "
A,Task,"I haven't I haven't taken it into consideration . "
C,Minor,"Huh ? Oh . Ah so "
D,Minor,"But th the younger people "
C,Task,"but it looks cool . "
A,Task,"I don't think we really need one . "
C,Minor,"Mm no . "
D,Task,"my investigation turns out that the younger people want a little bit uh material that that is uh spongy "
C,Minor,"Oh . Ah . "
C,Task,"flashy and "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"and uh "
C,Task,"I think would be cool comm scroll-wheel . "
D,Minor,"So A sc "
A,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"It's not that much "
C,Task,"uh if we take a normal scroll-wheel without the pushing comm then it's not expensive . "
C,Task,"We can do that . Think . "
A,Elicit,"But why do we need it ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"but why would we use it ? "
C,Task,"Ah we don't need it comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but it's uh it's design a design thing . "
A,Elicit,"If we don't need it comm why put it in your why put it in your in your if it's if it's not something people are looking for or is useful . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"you get "
D,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"I think they are looking for that . "
C,Task,"Of course we have uh a young target group . "
A,Elicit,"Are they ? "
C,Task,"So they might find that attractive in a remote con "
D,Task,"Scroll-wheel ? Uh I don't know . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but if it's if it's not useful comm "
A,Task,"I don't think it I don't think it gives an extra function to the remote . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's it . "
A,Minor,"Anyway "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So push-buttons we will use . "
C,Elicit,"Uh L_C_D_ screen ? "
B,Task,"Perhaps . "
B,Minor,"I have t I have two different "
C,Minor,"Is that s "
A,Minor,"What you what "
A,Elicit,"what'd you get on the L_C_D_ screen ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Is it expensive ? "
A,Minor,"Does it "
C,Task,"Uh I only know that if we are using that comm we need ano uh an advanced chip in it . "
C,Task,"And that is more expensive . "
A,Elicit,"And how much more expensive is that ? "
C,Task,"I have no idea . I have no absolute numbers . "
A,Minor,"Or "
A,Other,"No absolute numbers comm "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"I only have "
A,Task,"but it's just more expensive "
D,Minor,". "
A,Task,"and takes more room I suppose in your in your design . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but I don't think room is really an issue . "
A,Other,"Don't think it's an issue comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Oh let's go for "
A,Task,"let's say because it is uh very hot in n our target group I think comm "
A,Task,"we should take it take it t to consideration to build an L_C_D_ screen in it . "
B,Task,"I have two designs comm "
D,Minor,". "
B,Task,"one including uh an L_C_D_ screen comm wh which is basically the deluxe edition . "
D,Task,"For the future . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And then I also have a standard edition comm which wi we can also choose to develop too . "
A,Elicit,"Which basically has the same functionality comm but lacks the L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Task,"Yep "
B,Task,"Exactly . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"But we'll "
A,Minor,"We'll pick a we'll pick from uh "
A,Task,"we'll just combine everything later . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
C,Task,"Electronics comm "
C,Task,"uh the first one is the chip . "
C,Task,"Uh that's no longer an option comm "
C,Task,"it has to be an advanced one now . "
C,Task,"'Cause we have the L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Then we have an infrared sender comm "
C,Task,"I think that's basic comm "
C,Task,"we cannot do without . "
B,Minor,"Basically comm "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"it "
C,Task,"Otherwise it's not s a remote control . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And we have the sample sensor and speaker comm the voice recognition thing . "
C,Elicit,"Are we gonna do that or not ? "
A,Task,"Once again I was would ask you if it's expensive comm "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Minor,"I got "
A,Task,"but apparently you don't have any data . "
C,Task,"I only have uh uh relative information . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Elicit,"what d what was exact what you got on the on the new component ? "
B,Task,"I got an email that it's relatively small . "
A,Other,"That's small . "
A,Task,"So we can implement it . "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Other,"let me just Get back . "
A,Minor,"So why why "
A,Task,"if it's small and we can imp why shouldn't we ? "
C,Minor,"Oh "
C,Minor,"how did you "
A,Minor,"And there's um get your mar marketing report ? "
C,Task,"That goes also for the scroll-wheel comm by the way . "
A,Elicit,"What was uh the last number "
A,Elicit,"of how many people were interested in voice recognition ? "
D,Minor,"Um uh "
A,Task,"Although it's hard for different countries of course . "
D,Task,"The most of them um "
A,Task,"But you have to programme it yourself comm I suppose comm with your own voice . "
D,Task,"Um uh more than uh sixty percent . "
A,Other,"More than sixty percent of the people would like voice recognition . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mean of uh seventy percent I think . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Uh I'm "
D,Other,"I have to look it up . "
A,Task,"If it's small comm if it's fits comm if if people like it comm why not ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Elicit,"But don't we have any w uh information about scroll-wheel ? Scroll-wheel . If people would like that . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"No . No comm "
C,Task,"That's strange comm "
C,Task,"because that's the same story . "
D,Minor,"only "
C,Task,"It's it's not necessary like an L_C_D_ comm "
D,Task,"Ah . I don't know . "
C,Task,"but it's just it adds something to the design . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but we got some data on people that actually are int are interested in that comm "
A,Task,"and I don't think a scroll-wheel offers new functionality comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"On the most spee "
A,Task,"whereas speech recognition and L_C_D_ screen do offer new functionality in your product . "
C,Minor,"No "
D,Minor,"But "
C,Minor,"Oh that's r "
C,Task,"But I think uh we now already have to uh implement uh an advanced chip . "
A,Task,"Uh I think so comm "
C,Minor,"So it's m "
A,Minor,"because if I think we're specially w if you're going "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"for the future . "
A,Task,"maybe uh if you have the two editions you wanna wanna give out comm probably you have one with uh with speech recognition "
A,Minor,"and "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Minor,"they b "
B,Task,"they basically can have speech recognition . "
B,Task,"I mainly focused on the L_C_D_ uh aspect . "
A,Minor,"Um Yeah comm "
A,Task,"hold on a minute . "
A,Minor,"Were were you "
A,Elicit,"we're finished ? "
A,Minor,"Or "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"but that's that's okay . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Because if there's something that "
B,Task,"'Cause you wanted to see them comm "
C,Task,"There is still time . "
A,Minor,"'Cause have "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Elicit,"did you have all the materials ? "
A,Minor,"Or everything that you desc "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Task,"this was uh the last M_S_ . "
C,Task,"I have a clear picture . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so uh "
A,Task,"just just go for design for now . "
A,Task,"Just m have a seat for a second . Uh "
A,Task,"We'll combine everything after this . "
B,Task,"So this is basically the deluxe edition . "
A,Elicit,"Why is it s why is it squared ? "
B,Minor,"I j "
B,Other,"Why is it square ? "
A,Elicit,"Why did you pick square ? "
A,Elicit,"Or uh not square comm but why is it yeah comm sharp corners . "
B,Minor,"It "
B,Task,"'cause it's designy . "
B,Minor,"It's basically it has some futuristic Potentially comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"I don't really know . "
B,Task,"But I just thought that uh in normal remote controls you have like smooth curves and this and that comm "
D,Minor,"People "
A,Task,"Looks like a Star Trek phaser . "
B,Task,"and this is something new comm this is something different comm something fresh . "
A,Task,"It's true . "
B,Task,"And basically what you can see here is that it has a little comm yeah comm let's say gap "
D,Minor,"Ri "
B,Task,"which you can put your finger in . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Or Okay comm so just yeah comm "
D,Task,"So only r right-handed . "
A,Task,"you can rest it on your finger . "
B,Task,"So you can you can hold it really comfortable comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"that's basically the idea . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"But it but it's only right-handed then . Not for the left . "
B,Task,"Or left hand . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"it just uh "
D,Minor,"Or "
B,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"doesn't really matter . "
A,Task,"it's a curve inside a thing . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"As you can see comm this is the remote control "
D,Elicit,"Where ? "
D,Minor,"Wher "
A,Task,"It's on the back . "
D,Other,"Oh in the back comm okay . "
B,Task,"Uh you can't really see it that well comm "
D,Other,"Oh yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"but this is the L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So just imagine it goes that way . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm I think it's okay . "
D,Other,"Oh yeah yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Then you can see you can hold it in your left or in your right hand . "
B,Task,"And I also made a quick image comm 'cause I did not have that much time comm of the standard edition "
D,Minor,"I thought it "
B,Task,"which has basically the keys are pretty much the same . "
A,Elicit,"Keys are probably the n the number keys comm I suppose . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I had to do this really fast . "
B,Other,"So excuse me for the uh inconvenience here comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . Well comm "
B,Task,"but as you can see comm the keys moved . "
A,Task,"you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"these are basically the two types we have . "
A,Minor,"But "
B,Minor,"So if we were to select the L_C_D_ screen comm the transmitter here comm you can see the light i "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"I think what you have to keep in mind is that um you're moving the the the number keys from the top . "
A,Task,"Uh in the the simple design you have them at a top comm "
A,Task,"and the uh complex design you have them at the bottom . "
A,Task,"So it would that would give us a totally different design . "
A,Task,"So which actually making a whole different product instead of two different models . "
A,Task,"I think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"we can shift that . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"But normally comm as you can see there comm we put the uh number buttons right on top . "
B,Task,"Whereas because we had the L_C_D_ screen here comm we had to move them downward comm "
B,Minor,"so what you could say is that "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm uh "
A,Elicit,"or for example comm why did you pick the mm the numbers uh all the way below comm and the and the channels and volume control "
B,Task,"Because these are basically the functions you use the most . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"it it's "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"So if you hold it in your hand like this comm you put your finger in the gap comm "
B,Task,"this is the m most easy part . Bit . For zapping comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Hmm comm I agree . "
A,Task,"That's fine . That's fine . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"cau "
B,Task,"because people are zapping most of the time . "
A,Task,"Just as long as you tak took it into consideration what people would prefer . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm okay "
A,Task,"if you all agree comm I'm fine with it . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . So "
B,Task,"that's pretty much ha which I had in mind . "
B,Task,"As you can see here comm this can be spaced for extra keys comm "
B,Task,"which is the design thingys . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"No "
D,Minor,"it "
D,Task,"maybe it's better to look uh what the people want . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"So I can uh show my uh investigation . "
A,Minor,"I think we'll "
A,Task,"I think we're going towards the deluxe edition anyway comm "
A,Task,"because that seems to be what the people want . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm maybe it's better . "
A,Task,"But let's see what's what they want now . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Especially for young people . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Um where is that ? Where is th "
A,Task,"That's mine . "
D,Minor,"Oh . Uh "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"you should send it to the f to the folder first . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm I forgot that . "
A,Minor,"Okay um comm "
A,Task,"let's just assume we go to forty one . "
D,Task,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"now it must be there . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm here it is . "
D,Task,"Oh yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm uh "
D,Task,"the investigation turns out that the most appear uh people want um um uh look and feel likes is uh uh the s the same as before comm "
D,Task,"but it must be w a little bit fancier than uh the the look of it . "
D,Task,"Um the second important thing is um the it must be uh technol technological uh innova vative . "
D,Task,"So that's the L_C_D_ screen is perfect comm I think comm "
D,Minor,"and not uh "
B,Task,"Speech recognition . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm tha that's uh very important . "
D,Task,"And a third thing is um yeah comm it's uh should be easy to use comm "
D,Task,"so not not too much bu buttons and uh channel selection . "
D,Task,"I think that's uh what you showed is uh perfect . "
D,Task,"And what the pe young people want is uh in Paris and and in Milan uh it showed out that the fruit and vegetables are uh are trendy . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Th they "
D,Task,"you s you see it in the clothes and everything . "
D,Task,"And um the contrast uh of it comm it must uh the the buttons must a little bit spongy material . "
D,Task,"So uh rubber comm I think uh th that's the best . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"No . Yeah comm uh I agree . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Then rubber would be the best as a material indeed . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"I think so . "
D,Task,"So we are uh we were focussing uh on the younger people . "
B,Minor,"If that is the uh "
C,Task,"Okay comm agreement . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So the elder comm yeah comm they wanted a little bit of wood in it "
D,Task,"and uh that's uh th that's not uh important now . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"so we're definitely going for rubber . "
B,Task,"It could be a c it could be a cover . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But it's not . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Our focus is the young audience . "
A,Minor,"Let's just go "
D,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"So let's stick to that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"'Cause uh n I I I I thought uh it makes a young uh classic remote with uh "
A,Task,"Nah comm "
A,Task,"I think we're in this case you're losing the the focus on the young group comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"because we're that's what we're focussing on . "
D,Task,"that's why I I d uh decided With a fruit uh cover ov or something like that . Uh "
A,Task,"So I think the spongy feel gives us rubber . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"apparently "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Minor,"maybe also "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"I tend to disagree with with uh with a sharp form . "
A,Task,"I suppose it basi if you're uh saying fruits and vegetables comm maybe it's supposed to be a little little more round . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"in in form of an uh vegetable or an uh fruit comm maybe . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"for exa "
A,Task,"maybe like uh like a pear or something . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but that's just more a se a seasonal comm a trend thing . "
D,Minor,"And "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Minor,"where is your "
C,Task,"That's true . "
A,Task,"That's what we're doing . "
B,Task,"The idea now is is is that you can uh put a cover on it comm for example comm with fruit comm like a shape or whatever . "
D,Minor,"A trendy "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"I think shape is is important comm "
B,Minor,"But not "
D,Minor,"Here he here you can put a "
B,Task,"'cause a n next year it will it'll be something completely different . "
A,Task,"because they s they really extend . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Oh comm that's true . "
B,Task,"And then you have your apple-shaped remote control comm which is not trendy anymore . "
B,Task,"So I think that's more something you can focus "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but now you have your your like your Star Trek phaser thing shaped control . "
A,Task,"So I I th the edges are really really sharp . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Minor,"you can s "
D,Minor,"Uh maybe it "
A,Minor,"I'm uh not su "
B,Task,"What you can do is smooth the edges indeed . "
B,Task,"But that will bring extra c expenses . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Or maybe just make it make it up into into a low a smooth curve instead of just less sharp twist on the outside . "
D,Minor,"But "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"All uh veg uh fruit and vegetables are round . "
D,Minor,"So it's better "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"I think I think there needs to be a little "
A,Task,"I think it's too too sharp . The edges are too sharp . "
A,Task,"The bottom is fine of course if it's square . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But maybe just th make uh the top a little round it off on the sides . "
A,Minor,"So I mean y "
C,Task,"But I think comm according to my information comm this would be two curves . "
A,Other,"That would be two curves . "
D,Other,"Two ? "
C,Task,"We have one left and one right comm "
C,Elicit,"and that disables what was it again ? "
D,Minor,"But it "
C,Task,"It's some it's something that we cannot do then . "
A,Minor,"One cur "
A,Task,"you could also make the curve go through of course . "
A,Task,"But that would make make the top round . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"we've got we've got like one curve here . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"that's not a problem . "
B,Minor,"For the gap . "
C,Task,"That's only for the titanium . "
C,Minor,"We don't have . "
D,Minor,"But it's that "
D,Task,"that's for the comfort . "
B,Task,"And we could have one here . "
D,Task,"It's it's not for the trendy thing of it . "
B,Task,"No comm no no no no . "
B,Minor,"What I'm just "
B,Task,"'cause you mentioned that more curves the more expensive comm "
B,Task,"so I'm just taking that into account . "
D,Minor,"Yeah ? "
D,Other,"Okay comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yes "
A,Minor,"But let's see comm "
A,Task,"titanium would give us only one curve . "
C,Minor,"Then w "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"but we don't have that . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"but we're not d we're not using titanium . "
C,Minor,"So we have "
D,Minor,"So the no . "
C,Minor,"We have no . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"we picked rubber comm "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"Right comm we did . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"But they uh "
D,Minor,"We m "
B,Task,"So basically what we can do is m make these edges a little bit less sharp . "
A,Task,"Just doodle something on the board on the left . "
D,Minor,"form . "
B,Task,"But the problem then is that it will start to resemble m the remote controls as we have them today . "
B,Task,"We were looking at something fresh comm something trendy "
A,Minor,"Well actually comm "
A,Task,"we're setting ourselves apart from by technology alone actually . "
A,Minor,"So that "
A,Task,"let's see what you're doing . "
C,Minor,"They th "
C,Task,"these wha are what they call the curves . "
C,Task,"This side comm this side comm this is how they count . "
A,Other,"Oh comm okay . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I don't think like that . Not not really the curves on the on the side of the remote . "
C,Task,"No no . "
C,Task,"This is what they uh what they mean . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"Okay comm that's not really a good . "
B,Elicit,"so that's basically silly . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"now I uh of course now I understand why they have more uh like um Why the curves um decrease the the um the size the electronics that can be inside . So Okay . "
A,Task,"I don't think the outside would be called as a curve really . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's like this . "
A,Task,"I think it's for all the basic well comm looking from the side anyway . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Minor,"if you see what "
A,Task,"I have to come up with some designs fast anyway . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"But you can make uh if you want to use a fruit in uh in uh "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"But isn't the f the fruit like a cover thing comm "
D,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"because we "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"you shouldn't focus on the mostly on the covers comm "
D,Minor,"Hey comm you "
A,Task,"because lot of things we came up with comm "
A,Task,"shouldn't be too really too much shouldn't be too focussed on the covers "
D,Task,"You can make it like Like this . "
A,Task,"because it's kind of an idea of our own comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Other,"No comm "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"but we're not sure if we can actually make that . "
B,Task,"But if we put that directly into the design comm we limit ourselves extremely . "
B,Task,"Because it that's just for one seasonal trend . "
A,Task,"That's the one thing I'm also afraid of with this one "
D,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"because it the edges are really um they might stick out on the on the side for example . "
D,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"As a example . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"If you have a basic design comm a little m a little smaller on the on the s on the edges comm you could put more covers on it comm y one one with square or um sharp corners if you want to . "
D,Minor,"I d "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Minor,"so that's "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"well comm "
B,Minor,"that's probabl "
A,Minor,"M "
A,Task,"just round it off a little comm I guess comm "
A,Task,"because so we have more options I suppose . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Elicit,"comm you'd just like it to go a little bit more like this . "
A,Task,"I think so "
A,Task,"because it looks leaner "
A,Task,"and we should just go with that . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Anyway comm you have all the time in the world to make to make the final design in a minute with him . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"So So "
A,Minor,"we decided on what "
A,Elicit,"what did you guys wanna know again "
A,Minor,"because this is um "
A,Minor,"anyway comm "
A,Other,"I'll fire up my thing . "
A,Minor,"So so "
B,Elicit,"Did you present e everything you wanted to ? "
A,Task,"we come to a decision . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"I can uh qui "
A,Minor,"Uh what the "
C,Minor,"oh . "
C,Other,"I can quickly make a conclusion of what we have decided so far . "
B,Task,"Uh we still need to decide on a couple of things you you needed to know . "
A,Other,"Ah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm anyway . "
A,Task,"Uh energy comm we choose regular regular batteries . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"The chip is advanced "
A,Task,"because we have the advanced features . "
A,Task,"The case comm it will be the material will be rubber comm suppose . "
A,Minor,"Wouldn't the b the design we talked about . "
A,Other,"Uh user interface comm type . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I think we took all the components separately what we want . "
A,Minor,"Um let's see um "
A,Other,"supplements . I'm not sure what they mean by that . "
A,Minor,"Anyway comm um "
A,Task,"apparently you guys comm you should work together on the final design comm both on internal and external design . "
A,Minor,"So Yeah comm "
A,Task,"you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market comm how uh what's gonna happen with the final design as we have it now . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah "
A,Minor,"So Yeah comm "
A,Task,"of course you've got your specific instruction as usual . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Wanna spend some more "
A,Task,"um I think we're in a pretty much in agreement actually comm "
A,Task,"which is good . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"Are we all in agreement about the comm well comm the primary structure of the of my design ? Except for the edges . Like the keys there . "
A,Minor,"Lef "
A,Minor,"let's see comm "
A,Elicit,"where the pen go ? "
A,Task,"Here . "
A,Minor,"Yeah uh "
A,Task,"open your thing again . "
A,Task,"Let's see what if you can come up with anything new . "
A,Other,"Um I'll just do a next one . "
A,Minor,"So what would give us your ne your design would be "
A,Task,"the lights would be on top comm "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"Uh one on each one on each side . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"To create a kind of disco effect "
B,Minor,"when you "
B,Minor,"That was basically what w "
A,Elicit,"Is it is it the lights for for finding the finding remote "
A,Minor,"or lights that it that "
B,Task,"Light for the finding of the remote . "
B,Task,"We can also use one light for showing that the signal is being sent . "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think that should just be a simple LED or something . "
A,Minor,"Like that "
A,Task,"that's not that important of course . "
A,Task,"It just like a matter of a noise] a beep if you pre that you just know that that there's context . "
A,Task,"So I don't think that's super important . "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"So we have the teletext we have here comm "
B,Task,"we have the mute . "
A,Minor,"Uh sh Oh . "
B,Task,"L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Task,"This is the on off button . "
D,Elicit,"And speech w recognition . Are we "
B,Other,"Speech recognition comm "
B,Minor,"I "
D,Minor,"We Little uh voice uh Record and a uh "
B,Elicit,"where did I imagine . "
B,Task,"I did that pretty much over here comm "
B,Task,"so that you could use it like this and speak to it . "
D,Minor,"no . "
B,Task,"Then you have the uh extra keys for teletext comm mute comm "
B,Task,"two buttons which can be pretty much anything or nothing . "
B,Task,"We can also just not use them . "
A,Minor,"Let's see comm "
A,Other,"I'll just make "
B,Task,"Main controls and a key-pad . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"One light here . "
A,Task,"And just make it red now . "
A,Task,"But it could be any colour . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Will be fine . "
A,Task,"Okay comm whatever . Fine comm anyway . "
A,Elicit,"What do we have here ? "
A,Minor,"M I'll make it "
A,Elicit,"um are we gonna use square buttons or round ones actually ? "
A,Task,"Personally I would prefer round ones . "
C,Task,"Me too . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but that would "
D,Task,"Form of fruit . "
B,Task,"this was just in the design . "
D,Task,"It's better . "
B,Minor,"Because if you "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I had a square design . "
A,Minor,"for "
B,Task,"So I had square buttons . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But in that case the round buttons would be more appropriate . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"I assume it for "
A,Task,"so we take a r take a round power button right here . "
A,Task,"Whatever . "
A,Task,"Uh back to black . "
A,Task,"Uh not too big though . "
A,Task,"See this would be good . "
A,Minor,"Um let's see . "
A,Elicit,"Are these for any extra controls ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"The left one is teletext "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"and the right one is mute . "
B,Task,"And these two buttons are or not necessary "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"or "
A,Elicit,"If we go for for round buttons in general comm do we want to the menu key in the middle to be round ? For example comm "
A,Minor,"if you "
A,Minor,"let's see comm "
A,Other,"put it this here . "
A,Task,"I think we'll go with the triangles "
A,Minor,"that "
A,Other,"Come on . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm the triangles would be best indeed . "
A,Task,"Triangles are good . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"they're a little too big now . "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"Anyway comm "
A,Minor,"okay . So "
A,Elicit,"do you want for example a round button in the middle or square one ? "
B,Task,"I personally think that a round b button looks bit silly comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"I'm not sure uh comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I just just came up with it . "
A,Task,"This aligns nicely . "
A,Minor,"So Okay . "
A,Task,"We'll just take the take the round button comm suppose . Uh oh the square button comm "
A,Other,"sorry . "
B,Elicit,"Does everybody agree on that ? "
D,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"I suppose so . "
C,Task,"I would prefer round . "
C,Task,"But doesn't matter comm doesn't matter . "
B,Other,"You prefer a round ? "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"That's not a big deal comm think . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"there's our numbers . "
A,Task,"Think we need an extra button here of course for yeah comm like you had for the higher numbers . "
A,Task,"And you could include a button here for the mute comm I suppose . For something else comm "
A,Task,"just to mirror mirror the effect with this . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you can . "
B,Task,"But it but it's not necessary comm "
B,Minor,"becau "
A,Task,"That's not necessary "
A,Minor,"because it "
A,Task,"you can take this away comm "
A,Task,"but there it looks like there's a hole there comm "
A,Task,"just to mirror the effect . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Minor,"we have a few "
B,Task,"We could put our logo there . "
A,Task,"Nah comm "
A,Task,"I think it it would be nice to put the logo here comm for example comm if you have some buttons here . "
A,Task,"We could put a logo here "
A,Task,"because it's very always in your field of vision . If you're watching it comm the L_C_D_ screen comm blah blah . "
D,Minor,"And what about "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Elicit,"What about a button for your uh favourite channel ? "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Minor,"that could be that b "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"we could we could include either here or here comm for example . "
D,Task,"Uh yeah . With the extra controls . Uh "
A,Elicit,"But you think here or here ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"Uh one one set "
B,Task,"now it's getting a little bit too crowded up there . "
A,Task,"I know . "
B,Minor,"So Is your "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"you have to put it up uh "
B,Task,"So it can basically be the button down below or one of the four buttons up there . "
A,Minor,"No comm "
A,Task,"we could put this one as favourite channel for exam "
B,Minor,"Because "
D,Task,"One of the four . Uh comm it's better than comm I think . "
A,Elicit,"What are these for ? "
B,Task,"One of the four is better comm I suppose . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"It's a favourite channel . "
A,Other,"What ? "
D,Other,"What ? "
D,Minor,"Nee comm uh "
D,Task,"one of the four uh "
B,Task,"Because it's a little bit confusing to have twelve buttons down there comm "
D,Minor,"It's better th "
B,Task,"because you're only accustomed to eleven comm I'd say . "
A,Other,"You're accustomed to eleven ? "
A,Minor,"My uh "
A,Task,"okay comm have it your way . "
A,Task,"I mean comm think this looks rather like like there's something missing for example . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"we still need an okay button . "
A,Minor,"I mean why wouldn't you include a "
A,Task,"'cause there is a um a piece of electronics under there anyway . "
A,Elicit,"So why not give it a function . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . Hmm . "
A,Task,"Let's say I mean could be anything . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned . "
A,Minor,"But th "
A,Task,"No comm I don't think "
A,Task,"because this is a zero . "
A,Task,"But you want zero to be mis-aligned with the rest . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Anyway comm so "
A,Task,"this is the basic design comm we wanna have "
A,Task,"um on and off "
A,Elicit,"what are we missing ? "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Minor,"If it looks um "
B,Task,"we're pretty much missing an okay button comm "
B,Task,"but we have a button up there which is still free . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"so we want the remote to be the s the side view actually comm "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"what I'm gonna draw . "
A,Minor,"So Um "
A,Elicit,"probably think you want the curve to be here . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm pretty much . "
A,Minor,"Just gonna be sh "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Want this straight or what ? "
A,Task,"Let's keep it at this . "
A,Task,"So it would be like this . "
A,Elicit,"Do we want something interesting with it "
A,Minor,"or "
A,Minor,"see . "
A,Task,"Would give us a light here . "
A,Task,"Maybe it's boring . "
A,Elicit,"You want it curved or what ? "
A,Minor,"Maybe you want "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I think it looks better curved . "
A,Elicit,"Should like this ? "
B,Minor,"But that's probably uh "
A,Task,"Will give us design problem "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Minor,"because we have "
C,Task,"It can be curved . "
D,Elicit,"Why ? "
B,Other,"It can be curved comm "
B,Minor,"because that "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"yeah comm "
B,Task,"it's a little bit more trendy to be curved . "
A,Other,"It can be curved . "
A,Task,"Okay ? I think so . "
A,Task,"That's why I asked you . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
C,Task,"I would curve the whole actually . "
B,Other,"Hmm ? "
C,Task,"I would curve the whole . "
C,Task,"Like um like it hangs over your hand a little bit . "
A,Other,"Oh crap . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Then it will bounce "
C,Task,"and you don't drop it so easily . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Anyway comm so "
A,Elicit,"you want to a little more like this ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm something like that comm yes . "
D,Task,"Uh-huh . "
A,Minor,"And just s s "
C,Task,"Yes comm exactly . "
A,Elicit,"Stop the curve here "
A,Elicit,"or continue it "
C,Task,"I think continue like that . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Then there's also enough room for the electronics . "
A,Task,"So we have our L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Minor,"Let's see . "
B,Task,"But it pretty much looks like a banana already . Uh "
A,Minor,"In "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Let's make it yellow then . Uh "
D,Task,"Perfect . "
A,Minor,"Bana "
A,Other,"it's banana vision . "
B,Task,"It's fruit . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"it's perfect . "
A,Task,"So you have your L_C_D_ screen right here comm suppose . "
A,Minor,"Um that would make "
A,Other,"We use the colours now . "
A,Minor,"But Um "
C,Other,"Maybe once we can make a special edition in according with Chiquita . "
C,Other,"Have ourselves sponsored . "
A,Other,"You got sponsor comm now you get a free one with every pack of Chiquita . "
C,Other,"Uh but it's a good trade-off for them if they can have their logo on it . "
A,Task,"So it would give the buttons here . "
B,Task,"Or they can design their own cover . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"They might wanna be the first ones to uh "
B,Task,"We could set up a a marketing uh agreement . "
A,Minor,"I suppose I suppose we can put "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"um let's see . Um "
C,Task,"Oh comm perhaps they can use it . "
C,Task,"Or give a special edition "
C,Minor,"uh with with "
A,Task,"Uh I suppose we can put the batteries in here "
A,Task,"because it has the most space comm for example . "
B,Elicit,"Won't that be a problem with the L_C_D_ screen ? "
A,Task,"I don't think so "
A,Task,"because it's the biggest part of the uh of the uh "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but the L_C_D_ screen probably needs quite the chip . "
A,Minor,"Let's "
C,Task,"I think this is possible . "
A,Task,"I think it's possible . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I think it's the best place "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"you could also put 'em here . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"It doesn't matter . "
C,Task,"You can actually uh place a chip for the L_C_D_ screen and at the bottom comm "
C,Task,"and and wire it . "
C,Task,"Doesn't matter . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Other,"Okay comm that's not a problem . Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"so we put the batteries here . "
A,Task,"That's fine . "
A,Other,"Yep . Blah . "
B,Other,"I think we get the idea . "
A,Minor,"Um comm any other com what "
A,Elicit,"what are we missing here ? "
A,Minor,"Something "
A,Task,"a speech recognition . Um "
A,Elicit,"where do we want the microphone comm for example comm to be ? On the side or on the or comm for example comm on top ? Like here . "
D,Elicit,"Top ? "
B,Minor,"Oh comm basically "
D,Minor,"W "
D,Task,"On there . "
B,Task,"the idea that I had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter . "
C,Task,"I think on top . "
A,Minor,"To be "
B,Task,"'Cause you can talk to it like this . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"I w thought maybe it's either be here or "
D,Minor,"No . "
A,Task,"because it's mi it might interfere with the transmitter comm "
A,Task,"I'm not sure . "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"'Cause transmitter would be here . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"the email said it was a quite a small component . "
B,Task,"So I don't see that . "
A,Minor,"Why uh "
A,Task,"once again comm like you said comm the component can be somewhere at the bottom while we wire the microphone up there . "
A,Task,"Anyway . "
A,Minor,"Um yeah comm "
A,Task,"it could be either be here "
A,Task,"or make a double microphone . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I wouldn't mind . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Task,"It is comm I believe comm also able to talk . "
A,Elicit,"It's able to talk to you . "
B,Minor,"It's a "
C,Task,"I have a sample uh sample sensor and the speaker sensor . "
A,Other,"A speaker sensor . "
C,Task,"Uh the speaker sensor we already have comm "
C,Task,"but s I don't know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor . "
C,Elicit,"Could it talk back ? Like uh g uh give confirmation or something . "
C,Task,"I think it can . "
C,Task,"I think if you have a a speech recognition component comm then a s speaking component is not that hard to to put in either . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Minor,"the "
A,Task,"I think so comm it I think it could . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"I mean it could be a "
A,Task,"all this stuff could be integrated into the L_C_D_ screen comm "
A,Task,"which you could navigate with this comm I suppose . Navigate through everything . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . But "
A,Minor,"If you have I think you sh I think the advanced options should be "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"but do you actually need the remote talking back ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it sh the advanced option could also be integrated in the L_C_D_ screen comm of course comm "
A,Task,"because you don't have to have a button for everything . "
A,Task,"You can just navigate through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Think that would be fine . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"So that's w m would be making use of the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"We already have a sound component comm by the way comm for the beep . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"Beep . "
C,Other,"beep . "
B,Other,"Beep . "
D,Other,"Beep . "
A,Minor,"Um comm so "
A,Task,"the flashing of the beep comm we have well anything . "
A,Minor,"We could "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example . "
B,Task,"At the back comm "
B,Task,"yeah . Like that . Or at the side . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"For "
B,Minor,"Which is . "
A,Elicit,"how do you draw that again ? "
A,Task,"Uh whatever comm looks stupid . "
B,Elicit,"So what's basically edi the editi idea comm sorry comm now ? "
A,Minor,"I think this is pretty "
B,Elicit,"We need to stay here and work out that . "
C,Task,"I'm not sure . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"I should be getting new information comm I guess . "
A,Task,"I think you have to stay here "
A,Task,"because we are supposed to five minutes to finish the meeting . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Minor,"like my "
A,Task,"the info that I got was that you're uh we're gonna work on our own "
A,Task,"because you're gonna do the market market uh analysing "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"I'm supposed to do the little work on the year-end report . So the project report . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . Okay comm "
A,Minor,"I think we're "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Minor,"I suppose we'll "
A,Elicit,"everybody satisfied with the with the current design we have ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"So we're s supposed to be rubber . "
D,Task,"Ah comm that's fine . "
B,Task,"Pretty much . "
A,Minor,"I think "
A,Minor,"well comm "
A,Task,"I think the the remote control is gonna be black "
D,Minor,"Round . "
A,Task,"because we we forgot to talk about I mean the the company colours are important apparently . "
D,Minor,"Wh "
D,Elicit,"Why ? "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we have the logo up there . "
C,Minor,"But we have "
C,Elicit,"any company logo . "
A,Minor,"So are we gonna "
A,Task,"base colour is black ? "
C,Minor,"We have "
C,Task,"yes comm "
C,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"and yellow . "
A,Task,"And yeah comm "
A,Task,"of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever . "
C,Task,"I would change "
C,Task,". I would take a yellow remote control . "
A,Other,"Yellow "
A,Minor,"but yellow control . It's "
C,Task,"To have it flashy comm "
C,Minor,"to have it "
C,Task,"it's for young people . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but when you use covers comm it basically easier to have a n have a neutral colour on the base . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Need do be different . "
D,Minor,"It's the colour of a "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"don't don't stick yourself on the covers right now . "
A,Task,"But don't stick yourself on the cover "
A,Minor,"because "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"we're designing the remote control now comm "
B,Task,"but taking that into consideration comm it's better to have a neutral base colour than to have a flashy "
C,Task,"But we need to be different . "
A,Minor,"Nah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"but the info . "
A,Task,"I think we should go with uh with the company colour "
D,Minor,"But comm the you "
A,Task,"because what specific info that I got from the project board . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So I think we should go with that . "
D,Task,"The young people want uh a trendy uh remote control . "
A,Task,"They want something trendy . "
D,Minor,"So colourful uh is "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Task,"It's either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa . "
C,Task,"And I would say take a yellow cover and black buttons . "
B,Task,"It is more trendy . That's definitely true . "
A,Minor,"I think we should th "
C,Task,"To be different . "
A,Task,"then take it take yellow . Take what you c yellow remote control . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"let's see if if we can do the LED onto it . "
D,Task,"You have the basic colours comm blue comm green comm red . "
A,Minor,"Uh oh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"we have so many colours already . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"You know what ? "
D,Task,"Oh comm it's okay . "
A,Other,"I'm not gonna do this . "
C,Minor,"Oh no comm "
C,Minor,"that "
A,Task,"That's up to you guys . "
C,Task,"I think it's good thing to be different "
C,Minor,"than "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You doodle a doodle us a nice nice design for for the next meeting comm "
D,Minor,"Colourful comm you you "
C,Minor,"Well Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"we'll be done . "
A,Task,"I think we're all happy now . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
C,Task,"I still don't have my scroll-wheel though . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Stupid scroll-wheel . "
C,Minor,"Uh that's "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Elicit,"where would you like to put it ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Nah comm that's true . "
A,Minor,"'Kay "
A,Minor,"I'm not sure uh I really comm I'm no "
A,Elicit,"I have no clue what we could use the scroll-wheel for . "
B,Task,"Uh you could use it for the channels and for the volume . "
C,Task,"No comm forget it . "
D,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
B,Task,"But it's has no real added value . "
C,Minor,"No look comm "
D,Minor,"You can "
C,Minor,"it "
A,Task,"It takes space comm a lot of space . "
C,Task,"No comm that's not my point . "
A,Minor,"And it could "
C,Task,"It's not because it's functional comm "
C,Task,"but it's just to add to the design comm to have it flashy . "
D,Minor,"Ah "
C,Task,"It it has no function comm I agree . I agree . "
D,Minor,"may "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but if it has no function comm "
A,Task,"I'm not sure "
B,Minor,"then "
A,Elicit,"if it if it has no function comm why even put it there ? "
C,Minor,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"so many things have no function comm just design . "
A,Task,"And th that's just so much things that make it look flash "
D,Minor,"But uh uh scroll for a channel s selection or volume "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Hmm . "
A,Task,"I think channel selection would be annoying "
D,Minor,"Ma "
A,Task,"because it just c you could scroll past the channel "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"Let's vote on it . "
D,Minor,"Oh okay . "
C,Task,"Then we don't have to talk about it any longer . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Oh okay . "
C,Elicit,"What do you want ? "
C,Elicit,"In "
C,Elicit,"or out ? "
B,Task,"Basically out . "
B,Minor,"I don't see the "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"You are out of course . "
C,Elicit,"You are "
D,Task,"Out . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Other,"okay comm clear . "
A,Task,"No r no scroll-wheel . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um "
A,Task,"I don't see anything missing really . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"we should "
B,Elicit,"Do you have all your answers ? "
A,Task,"too bad we don't have the finance . "
A,Minor,"We could've "
C,Task,"I have all my answers comm yes . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"it's "
A,Task,"I'm not sure if we're if we're gonna get finance anyway "
A,Task,"because I thought we cou I thought it was gonna be an issue at the first time we started . "
D,Task,"I have to call this in a form . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"I thought it was gonna be a cost issue which material we were gonna take relative to the advanced chips or anything . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"There is "
C,Other,"I have one question . "
A,Task,"So you just do whatever you like "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"and uh doesn't care what it costs . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Other,"I only have one question with the material comm "
C,Task,"but I don't have information that . "
C,Task,"We've chosen rubber . "
A,Minor,"I think we're "
A,Task,"rubber is not expensive . Definitely . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Elicit,"but can we make yellow rubber ? "
C,Task,"I think so "
A,Task,"You can make rubber in any colour . In any colour . "
B,Task,"Yes comm you can colour rubber comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Ah . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I mean you can't make yellow titanium comm "
A,Task,"but you can make yellow rubber . "
D,Minor,"But we ha w "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"we don't uh use our reco uh we uh removable cover ? "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh yeah "
D,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"we can make uh "
D,Elicit,"huh ? "
A,Task,"for example it's just something you can click on it "
A,Minor,"like uh that's but it's not som not "
A,Task,"apparently that's not something we're working with in the basic design . "
D,Task,"Maybe maybe later comm "
A,Minor,"So . "
D,Minor,"maybe we can uh "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it could be . "
A,Task,"It can be done comm "
A,Minor,"for e "
