A,Elicit,"Can I close this ? "
B,Task,"Uh we don't have any changes comm "
B,Elicit,"do we ? "
B,Task,"So no . "
A,Other,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Other,"There we go . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"here we are again . "
A,Task,"Detailed design "
A,Other,"oh comm come on . "
A,Minor,"Well Ah "
A,Minor,"s "
A,Task,"Forgot to insert the minutes comm "
A,Task,"but it's about the same thing we discussed before . Uh "
A,Other,"Could open that anyway comm think . "
A,Minor,"Other design "
A,Task,"anyway comm we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time . "
A,Task,"We also that you're just busy with it . "
A,Task,"Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"we discussed the design comm "
A,Task,"no sharp corners comm we rounded it off comm "
A,Task,"like you see on the other screen comm "
A,Task,"which is fine . "
A,Task,"Um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black . "
A,Task,"Yellow in the back because it's m trendy comm more trendy than black anyway . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"then we ca "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Task,"We agreed that we would implement both the L_C_D_ and speech recognition comm "
A,Other,"but I'll get to that in a moment . "
A,Task,"'Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway . "
A,Minor,"So so comm "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"like I said comm we had no insight in finances comm no prices comm "
A,Task,"but we have 'em now comm "
A,Task,"and it's bad . "
A,Minor,"Anyway . "
A,Minor,"We are "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Prototype presentation comm well first "
A,Task,"you guys built the prototype . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"you could could present that . "
A,Other,"But um let's see what be handy to do . "
A,Task,"Nee no comm "
A,Task,"you just go ahead and present "
A,Minor,"the w "
A,Task,"we'll scrap it later "
A,Minor,"because "
C,Task,"I think it's more or less the same as we had . "
A,Other,"What ? "
B,Task,"It's basically what we agreed upon comm "
D,Other,"Hmm ? "
A,Other,"Oh "
B,Task,"but just a little bit more specified . "
A,Minor,"that's "
C,Minor,"No much s "
A,Elicit,"hasn't changed that much comm huh ? "
C,Task,"No no no comm not at all . "
A,Task,"I didn't expect anyway . "
A,Task,"You just coloured it . "
B,Minor,"Uh s "
B,Task,"Final design . "
B,Task,"Basically in what we discussed comm cover and buttons will be made of rubber comm yellow colour comm black components comm "
B,Task,"as you can see right over here . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow "
A,Task,"I like the menu . "
B,Task,"so that it com really shows in this keypad . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"If you put them all black comm it's not really that good a contrast . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber . It's it's part of the rubber comm I suppose . "
B,Minor,"Probab "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think that's more I think that's more durable anyway than printed on to "
B,Minor,"That's the be "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"And it I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber "
C,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
B,Minor,"than to uh "
D,Task,"Mm yeah . "
C,Task,"That's uh the integration story again . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So we have it's a bit round shaped comm "
A,Task,"Oh yeah . "
B,Task,"that's what we had "
B,Minor,"uh "
B,Task,"We chose the buttons to be uh teletext comm okay button comm favourite channel and the mute . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So that's basically what we chose there . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"If you have anything to add comm please interrupt me . "
C,Minor,"No comm uh "
C,Task,"this is just a description of what we see there . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Speaks for itself . "
B,Task,"That's pretty much it . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Now it's my time to ruin everything . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Other,"not ruin everything comm "
A,Minor,"but "
B,Other,"Oh sorry . "
A,Other,"no comm nah . "
A,Task,"Finances comm "
A,Task,"that's what we have here comm what you drew . "
A,Task,"We have battery power comm "
A,Task,"we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway . "
A,Minor,"So which you see the "
A,Task,"which is de o one of the most expensive parts . "
A,Minor,"So well comm "
A,Task,"we have sin one curve comm a design . Rubber design . "
A,Task,"And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour . "
A,Task,"So just half a Euro for "
A,Task,"You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . "
A,Task,"You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"easy . "
A,Elicit,"What do we scrap . "
A,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"I d "
A,Task,"think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I'd say that too . "
A,Task,"Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"There are ninety one percent of uh the people comm or something like that . But ninety percent who favour an L_C_D_ display comm "
A,Task,"and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . "
A,Minor,"I think it's also harder to "
B,Task,"Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"which you can't do with a normal remote control comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"which people already do . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,". So I ju "
A,Task,"I took that out . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"and so it's still stuck with thirteen comm "
A,Task,"so I had to take out the special colour I suppose . "
A,Minor,"And comm yeah "
A,Task,"comm I didn't see anything else I could take out . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Pushbut "
A,Task,"I could take out the push-buttons comm "
A,Task,"but we need those . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Task,"So comm generally what I came up with comm in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros comm spe scrap speech recognition "
D,Other,"Special colour comm yeah . "
A,Task,"and the separate covers can account for the if people want it comm "
A,Task,"we'll just then we'll do it in black . "
A,Task,"We'll just deliver it in black comm "
A,Minor,"have the "
A,Task,"it has all the function that it's supposed to have comm "
A,Task,"and if you want it if you want the custom design comm then you can buy the separate covers . "
A,Task,"You make it d orange or whatever you want . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I'd I tend to disagree with you on that comm "
B,Task,"because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this . "
A,Task,"It was a big issue comm but "
B,Elicit,"So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? "
A,Other,"I'll just go back . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Minor,"let's just let's see what "
A,Minor,"okay comm "
A,Minor,"let's just see what we "
A,Task,"no comm "
A,Task,"we we have to be under twelve and a half . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"it "
A,Minor,"It it's not "
D,Minor,"The p "
A,Task,"uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half comm "
C,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"but there's another problem . "
D,Minor,"And the p "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"so . "
C,Task,"But there's another problem . "
D,Minor,"What "
C,Task,"If we take another cover comm for instance black comm then we also need another button frame comm "
C,Task,"'cause black and black doesn't work obviously . "
A,Minor,"I think you "
A,Task,"that's what you were ass assigned to do really comm to to see how b th both those work together . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Minor,"Huh . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So I think yeah comm it's I think it's y one of the "
A,Task,"it's a good way to um to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Just keep you just make new covers for the for it comm "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"like we agreed before . "
C,Task,"I agree . "
A,Task,"And everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have . "
A,Task,"Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . "
A,Task,"But we need that for the L_C_D_ display . "
B,Task,"Yeah . We do . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Then again comm we have the L_C_D_ display comm which is also expensive . "
A,Minor,"B "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"but those go together . "
A,Task,"And yeah comm "
A,Task,"we could take out the curve . "
C,Task,"Or say let's lose rubber comm take plastic . "
B,Task,"We could take out a curve indeed . "
A,Minor,"Could "
A,Task,"we could take out the curve . "
A,Elicit,"Is that an option ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"For you ? "
D,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Although we are demolishing a little bit the style . "
D,Minor,"But uh the and "
B,Task,"I think the colour is more important than the really the curve comm "
C,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it's it it does ruin it comm "
D,Minor,"The people "
A,Minor,"but the fact that I t took that decision or t "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Took this example actually comm not really decision comm "
A,Task,"but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers . "
A,Task,"So you can change any colour you want . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want . "
C,Elicit,"Can we then not also uh change the material ? "
C,Task,"We take plastic for the basic cover "
A,Task,"You can take plastic comm "
C,Minor,"and "
A,Minor,"but I d it's "
A,Task,"something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the "
D,Task,"Spongy comm yeah . "
C,Task,"We can put those to the to the other covers . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls comm "
D,Minor,"And "
A,Task,"because they're all plastic . "
C,Task,"That's true . "
A,Minor,"So which in in turn "
A,Task,"Rubber would increase durability "
C,Minor,"But "
C,Minor,"okay . "
A,Task,"because it doesn't break . "
C,Elicit,"But what do you then suggest we'd lose ? "
C,Task,"Because we have to lose two things and I guess . "
A,Minor,"I al "
A,Task,"like I said comm I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour comm "
D,Minor,"But "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"which would make this black a black and grey . "
C,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Elicit,"and that's enough ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's that that that's enough comm "
B,Task,"So black and grey is okay . "
A,Minor,"because "
A,Task,"I guess those are the basic colours . "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"So Oh . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Which we can fabricate comm "
B,Other,"okay . "
D,Task,"The people want to pay for for it comm "
A,Minor,"I think those are basic col They want to "
D,Elicit,"so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ? "
A,Task,"To ensure the profit . "
A,Task,"That that's th that's the order . "
A,Task,"We're just uh we're the project team "
A,Task,"and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this . "
D,Task,"But we can take a risk . "
A,Minor,"But that's not for our "
A,Task,"that's not our decision to take . "
B,Minor,"No comm "
B,Minor,"we basically "
A,Task,"We have a budget of twelve fifty per product . "
D,Other,"Okay comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"We need to stick to that . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Stick that . "
A,Task,"I don't think it's really bad either . I mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing "
D,Other,"I hope the people will like it comm "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"to have "
A,Task,"I think they would do . Th I think they do like "
A,Minor,"because yo we you "
A,Task,"we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea comm "
A,Task,"because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect "
C,Minor,"Perhaps we should make m "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Task,"and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . "
D,Other,"The first sheet . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . "
C,Task,"And that's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost comm that they know that . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"I don't think "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Perhaps they decide tha "
A,Minor,"Is it worth is it is it "
B,Minor,"But they don't "
A,Elicit,"does it mean anything to the customer ? "
A,Minor,"Like comm it like comm we don't care we don't care that you had to "
C,Task,"Of course . "
C,Minor,"Perhaps they uh "
C,Minor,"no comm "
C,Task,"but perhaps they think uh okay comm the cover is such a nice idea comm uh let's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs . "
C,Minor,"We ca we uh we can at least tell them that "
A,Task,"True comm "
A,Task,"but we did we didn't get that . "
A,Minor,"So I think it's "
C,Task,"You don't know that . "
A,Task,"it should either be a pack comm maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something . "
B,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Task,"No comm I'm not uh talking about that cost "
A,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"but the one that g has given us the order to design this . "
C,Task,"We could at least m uh make it like this comm like you said comm "
A,Minor,"They could comm but uh "
C,Task,"and then tell them okay comm we had to drop this and that comm just that you know . It is an still an option comm but not for this price . "
A,Minor,"It's an option comm but "
A,Task,"yeah comm it's true . "
A,Task,"So actually uh it's not that much of an increase comm "
A,Minor,"but yeah . "
B,Minor,"And if we "
A,Task,"We cannot contact them . "
A,Task,"It's just the order that we got . "
C,Task,"Exactly comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"So that's what we gotta go with . "
A,Minor,"So it's either one fi just just to get it f "
A,Task,"just to get it through final comm "
A,Task,"it's either turned into plastic comm drop the squishy feel comm make it make it more breakable comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"um or turn it yellow . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"It's uh something we have to decide on . "
C,Task,"I'd say lose the curve and the colour "
A,Other,"I say lose the curve . Oh that's true comm "
C,Minor,"and "
A,Minor,"we could lose the c "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"I forgot that comm "
A,Other,"sorry . "
A,Other,"Uh the curve . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"So which curve is that "
B,Minor,"ba "
B,Task,"that's basically that curve . "
A,Task,"That's just this one just d this is the banana curve . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's better . "
A,Task,"So this would this would be straight . "
B,Task,"So we could u still have the comfort . "
A,Task,"No comm uh no comm "
A,Task,"that would be a curve inside the thing comm I guess . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"would ju then it would just be a straight remote . Just like like that . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Which would comm yeah comm turn it into something far more ordinary . "
A,Task,"we could make it yellow then comm "
B,Task,"I second that . "
A,Minor,"but "
A,Other,"You second that comm you second that we lose the curve . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . "
A,Other,"Okay comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"So that's not really that "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve "
A,Task,"to separate it from the rest of the remote control world comm so to speak . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"So we keep the curve . "
A,Elicit,"So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . "
B,Minor,"I would "
A,Task,"And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber comm "
A,Task,"because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has . "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Task,"I agree . "
B,Task,"Yeah . I would say I would agree with you on the colour comm "
C,Minor,"No . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"because that's an extra option comm an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So we can always do that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm um "
A,Task,"I guess people are willing to pay for that . "
A,Task,"So I think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm ? "
A,Task,"So I think that would still make it a nice product . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we're final on that . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing . "
A,Task,"But anyways we're here . "
A,Minor,"Um yeah . "
B,Task,"Which is basically what we discussed . "
A,Task,"This we discussed just now . "
A,Minor,"That's just now just "
A,Task,"we could just discuss how the project went . "
A,Minor,"I mean comm was kind of "
D,Other,"And I want to do that . "
A,Task,"I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way comm "
A,Minor,"but because you "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"everything cannot be for free . "
A,Minor,"We didn't "
A,Task,"I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time . "
A,Minor,"Because that was I th "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Minor,"we could have "
A,Task,"it was really essential really "
A,Minor,"to ma "
A,Task,"because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"So we just put something "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Me too comm I felt a bit blind throughout the project comm "
C,Task,"because in the beginning I had no list of available materials comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think would have been . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and then I d had not list of available c finances . "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"Materials would be ok "
A,Task,"at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"So I suppose "
D,Minor,"Let's um see um "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"let's see if it sells . "
A,Task,"I mean I suppose this sells comm "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"because it's very very extended . "
A,Minor,"But "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Other,"I hope it sells . "
D,Minor,"Let's "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"I suppose it sells comm "
A,Task,"because it's good . "
D,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price comm "
A,Task,"because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . Okay comm "
D,Task,"let's eval evaluate uh the product of us comm our design . "
D,Task,"Um I have some uh a method comm a requirements and scale of . "
D,Task,"I uh will pre present uh some statements "
D,Task,"and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false "
D,Task,"and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Have been met comm okay . "
D,Other,"And I will uh make a new blank sheet "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So so the buttons comm the look and feel . "
D,Task,"I thought it was okay comm but the advanced uh settings comm um screen comm audio and channel "
B,Task,"Which are basically accessible through the menu button . "
A,Task,"They're stuck under menu . "
D,Minor,"We are not "
A,Other,"For the menu . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"I think those are totally met comm "
A,Task,"because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want comm "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Elicit,"the menu button is it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Hi "
D,Minor,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Task,"they have the simplicity they want . "
D,Minor,"Then it's all uh S "
A,Task,"I think it's very uh very well met . "
A,Task,"Either two or one maybe . "
C,Task,"One . "
D,Task,"it's true . "
A,Task,"I think we took that everything they wanted into consideration . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So it could either be a two or a one . "
D,Minor,"So d "
D,Other,"Oh wait . Uh pen . "
A,Other,"One and a half . "
B,Task,"Which is not an option . "
D,Minor,"The p "
D,Other,"Oh yeah comm "
D,Task,"it's red comm "
A,Other,"Just create our own option . "
D,Task,"okay comm "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"Look and feel is everybo it's true . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Other,"Anyone ? "
D,Task,"And the next one uh yeah comm when it's lost uh you can find it . "
A,Task,"It's perfect . Even for deaf people comm "
D,Minor,"It's "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"It's "
A,Task,"I don't think it's perfect comm but we did everything possible to to get it back . "
B,Task,"To make it that way comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Because if it's stuck in you couch comm you can see the light . "
A,Task,"Maybe you can hear it . "
A,Task,"But I mean we tried comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so I think it that's that deserves a one . Definitely . "
D,Minor,"And it's and it's "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"To . "
D,Task,"That's okay then . "
D,Other,"And the next one . "
D,Elicit,"How is that ? Uh w we had we don't have an uh manual comm "
C,Task,"Manual . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"But I think that's a part of it . "
C,Task,"I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control comm "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"I'd use an remote control . "
B,Task,"Mm yeah . "
C,Task,"but then again comm it's for young people . "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"an L_C_D_ comm it tells a lot about uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I th "
B,Task,"And it's pretty straight-forward comm "
B,Task,"you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the L_C_D_ menus . "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
A,Task,"It's pretty straight-forward comm uh-huh . "
C,Task,"No comm that's true . "
C,Task,"I think it won't be a big problem . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"So it's a one "
D,Minor,"or a "
B,Task,"One I d no comm "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Minor,"actu "
A,Minor,"I think but we didn't even "
D,Task,"For the advanced uh settings . "
A,Task,"there was no issue on making a manual actually . "
A,Task,"We didn't really discuss it comm "
D,Task,"No okay comm that uh that's true . "
A,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"I don't think it takes "
A,Task,"no comm it really does doesn't take time to learn comm I think . "
A,Task,"We took it s it's so easy comm "
B,Task,"No comm "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"it it is pretty straight-forward . "
D,Minor,"so it "
A,Task,"we have so little button comm "
A,Task,"everything speaks for itself really . "
A,Minor,"So I think that's "
C,Minor,"Ah . Um "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Minor,"we didn't "
A,Task,"it's either two or one comm I guess . "
D,Minor,"Takes no ti "
A,Task,"Maybe it's a two comm "
A,Task,"because d uh the L_C_D_ is a little is a little new "
A,Task,"and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button . "
C,Task,"With the more important functions on . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So I might make this a two instead of a one comm I guess . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And the L_C_D_ comm you have to see it . "
A,Task,"So just make that a two . "
D,Minor,"Um mm "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Minor,"it's a little bit learning . "
D,Minor,"Okay . Uh yeah "
D,Task,"it's uh a little bit same . "
D,Elicit,"But it tells you or not ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . "
A,Task,"I think so . "
A,Task,"I think it's perfect comm the w where it is comm what it can do comm if it useful . "
A,Task,"I think so . "
D,Minor,"But wha w "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"oh comm yeah . "
D,Elicit,"What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ? "
D,Elicit,"Just uh only the channels and or "
C,Task,"the menus uh "
D,Other,"What uh ? "
C,Task,"Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu comm "
C,Task,"because we have no buttons for those . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"basically the menu options indeed . "
B,Minor,"But "
D,Other,"Oh comm in the L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Minor,"No comm "
A,Minor,"y "
A,Elicit,"I mean in the L_C_D_ screen comm the small screen . What does it display ? "
C,Other,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"And for a channel selection comm uh or that's not "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"I thought it was I thought it was "
A,Task,"I thought that people wanted previews on their "
A,Task,"I'm not sure if that even possible comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I thought I thought too "
A,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Task,"'cause it's this requires a quite quite a bit of band-width . "
A,Task,"I don't think it's possible really . "
A,Minor,"But the "
A,Task,"they didn't really define in what should be used for . "
D,Task,"Maybe a T_V_ guide or something in your L_C_D_ uh "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"But I think in for example like T_V_ guides comm I think that's that th that you can transmit through it and everything . Just for extra information on your programmes . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"it must be clear then what what what for we use it . "
A,Minor,"But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your "
A,Elicit,"uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example comm how do you configure that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So that could be done by L_C_D_ display . "
A,Task,"I think it's good . "
A,Task,"No comm maybe it's not a one "
A,Task,"because it's we're not using it perfectly . "
A,Minor,"We didn't give it I don't thing over-discussing . "
A,Task,"Now we gave it enough thought though . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think we d should just lower this . "
A,Task,"Maybe maybe it's a three though . "
A,Task,"We could've used it more effectively probably . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm indeed . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"everybody's agree with an uh three on it comm "
D,Minor,"it's "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Two or three . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"we are using it comm "
D,Minor,"W "
A,Minor,"but it's not "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"it's not poorly used comm but it's not efficiently used comm I think . "
A,Task,"We could have ev even lost the selection button and uh done everything via L_C_D_ selection . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"It's "
A,Task,"now it's just extra to illustrate im uh extra features comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"I "
A,Task,"but okay . "
D,Task,"A three . "
C,Task,"Nah comm it's not really only an extra . "
B,Minor,"You can seven . "
D,Minor,"Ah comm nothing comm that's A seven . Uh that's uh "
C,Task,"No menus . "
C,Minor,"Think about "
A,Elicit,"Can you talk to remote control ? "
B,Minor,"Or we could say it "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"it can't talk anymore . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So we scrap that . "
B,Task,"Or we could say neutral comm "
B,Minor,"we 'cause we scratched the "
A,Minor,"Oh yeah "
A,Other,"Just to be a prick comm "
B,Minor,"C "
A,Task,"but of course you can talk to your remote control comm it doesn't do anything . "
D,Minor,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"But you c you can talk to it . "
D,Task,"Not with the speech recognition . "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah comm "
D,Task,"all the trends and no colours uh anymore . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"we did take everything into consideration of course . "
A,Minor,"Uh the shape i shape is i "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"uh um only in the curves . "
A,Minor,"I think we "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think that's okay . "
D,Task,"But the colours comm we don't have special colours on it . "
B,Task,"No comm we don't have the colour . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"So I "
A,Minor,"special co "
A,Task,"but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"but we "
A,Minor,"to the fashi "
B,Minor,"Yes comm "
B,Minor,"but the end product So "
D,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"we don't have it comm "
D,Minor,"so d "
A,Other,"We don't have it "
A,Task,"we do have it comm "
D,Minor,"In the end product . "
A,Task,"it's just sold as a package . "
C,Minor,"But M "
A,Minor,"It does "
A,Task,"it's not part of the basic product . "
C,Task,"Changing covers is also trend that we followed . "
A,Minor,"It that "
A,Task,"that's what I call trendy . "
A,Task,"I mean the shape is trendy . "
A,Task,"The the sh the the functions are trendy . "
A,Task,"It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . "
D,Minor,"Now "
A,Minor,"Because you ha "
A,Task,"it's just not affordable at the moment . "
D,Elicit,"But it's not a one . "
B,Task,"Maybe we should go with a two then comm "
B,Task,"because it's not perfect comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"because we can't do it initially comm "
B,Minor,"but we "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"It's possible comm "
A,Task,"but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour . "
D,Other,"Oh well Oops . "
D,Task,"Oh it's a two comm "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"On the last one . "
D,Task,"Uh that n that's all . "
B,Other,"Overall score . "
A,Other,"Overall score . "
D,Task,"Overall . "
D,Minor,"It's um "
A,Task,"One two three . sixteen . "
D,Other,"ten comm sixteen three uh two "
A,Task,"Two two point some two point something . "
D,Task,"two point seven or something like that . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"I don't know why . "
B,Task,"Ten comm sixteen comm divided by "
A,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Six . "
D,Task,"Six . "
B,Task,"Is two two third . "
A,Other,"Two and two thirds . "
D,Minor,"Um So "
D,Task,"we can say it's it's the product is it's okay . "
A,Task,"It's okay comm "
D,Minor,"Y not "
A,Minor,"but that's yo m "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . "
B,Minor,"There's "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"'Cause yeah comm that gives you a seven comm "
A,Task,"which ruins your your average . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Without that it would be like under it wouldn't yeah comm it would be under two . "
A,Task,"So I think we have even with this it's reasonable . "
D,Other,"Woah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"if we make it into a four comm as in neutral comm because we didn't implement it comm so we can't say that we that it's really not well implemented . We come out on a average of two one eighth . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"I think it's "
A,Task,"two is okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"which is pretty w good . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm two is pretty good . "
B,Task,"It's at least on the positive side . "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Hmm comm of course . "
A,Task,"Definitely . "
B,Task,"We could definitely have done better if we've had more resources comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I think it's probably I "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display . "
A,Task,"We could have used it more efficiently comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"we just didn't think of it that way . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"..# "
D,Minor,"with . "
B,Task,"True . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"like I said comm changing channels comm everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display comm so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything . "
D,Other,"The scale . "
C,Task,"But I think for this price comm this is it's really a reasonable product . "
A,Task,"I think we div I think we did very well comm "
C,Task,"It's a good product . "
A,Task,"uh ev even if you look at this score comm we did quite well . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"With an L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Minor,"Oh . Oh . Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved . "
A,Minor,"So . "
C,Task,"But if pep people really want speech recognition comm then they must be prepared to pu to pay more comm "
C,Task,"because it's cannot be done for this . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"They sh they should get kids comm and just stick 'em in T_V_ and say change the channel . "
D,Task,"you can make 'em another one . "
C,Minor,"Hmm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Ah "
C,Task,"but for this price uh you cannot ask that . "
A,Task,"I don' think so . "
C,Minor,"You cannot th think of that "
A,Task,"Uh it's just not it it's not affordable . "
C,Task,"No comm it's not . "
A,Task,"Or your sh you should lose the L_C_D_ screen probably comm "
A,Task,"but I think that's I think the L_C_D_ screen is more worth than speech recognition . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Oh It's also more attractive . "
A,Task,"Definitely . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"that was that . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"So that's the final product without the speakers comm I guess . "
B,Minor,"So did you "
A,Minor,"Let's see comm "
A,Minor,"what was left in the the Another one . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . Yeah comm "
A,Task,"we evaluate the product . "
A,Minor,"General project comm what's i in "
A,Task,"For example comm I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . "
A,Task,"We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example comm "
A,Task,"which I thought was pretty creative comm "
A,Task,"because it was never never ever listed somewhere . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Other,"Favourite channel . "
A,Minor,"Well Anyways . Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"leadership is up to you . "
A,Task,"I mean perhaps I screwed up "
A,Task,"because I d put a put a speech recognition into it . "
A,Task,"But that's not for me to decide . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm I know . Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think we did pretty well as team-work though . "
A,Task,"Because comm yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime comm "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results comm initially of course I wanted to contact you . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you're working separate . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Say comm look comm this is you're doing the wrong thing comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Task,"you're s you're wasting your time now comm "
A,Task,"because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"So it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . Direct uh communication with yeah . "
B,Task,"And we could share information which we received . "
A,Task,"because that's that's what would w you what you would normally do comm either call or email someone . "
A,Task,"So that was too bad "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"con "
A,Task,"was impossible here anyways . . "
C,Task,"That's the same thing that I had in the beginning . "
C,Task,"Everybody was using materials that s I didn't have . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"It didn't have "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"or didn't knew what they costs or whatever . "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"So that was a little unclear I suppose . "
A,Task,"I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool . "
A,Task,"I think uh s especially for design issues comm it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them . "
D,Other,"My handwriting is little bit "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher comm "
A,Minor,"It's a little less it "
A,Task,"the response time is le it's very bad . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"because "
A,Task,"It's good to visualise everything comm "
A,Task,"but I think the response time should could be a lot better . "
B,Task,"The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that . "
D,Minor,"But th that's "
A,Task,"Definitely . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's true . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"But there's uh also one problem with this I noticed . "
C,Task,"Uh you have to finish a page before going to a n "
A,Task,"No comm you don't have to . No comm you don't . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"I jin "
D,Minor,"You can "
C,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"I didn't check the finish button . "
A,Minor,"I just "
A,Task,"you just ditch it "
D,Task,"Done and then it's okay . "
A,Task,"and you can copy it or whatever . "
C,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"I saw that uh "
A,Task,"Uh only if you uh check the notes or press done . Then it um then you can then it exports to Word automatically . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"But it's not necessary to check either one of those two . "
A,Task,"You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"but I made "
D,Other,"Oh comm okay . "
C,Other,"Okay comm "
D,Other,"Okay comm yeah . "
C,Task,"but I made three pages "
C,Task,"and they were not finished . "
C,Task,"And when the third one was finished comm I wanted to download it "
C,Task,"and then it was not possible anymore comm "
C,Task,"because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"before starting a ne a new page . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay comm that could be b . "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
C,Task,"So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"You have to finish it completely comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Oh can you ? Okay . "
C,Task,"then download it comm "
C,Minor,"it's "
C,Task,"then start a new one . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"That's not very uh handy comm "
C,Task,"but if you know that comm then it's not a problem . "
A,Minor,"That's "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"it's understandable comm okay . "
A,Elicit,"Any new ideas ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"more communication between between uh "
A,Task,"that's the thing I noticed comm that communication is very um very important comm "
D,Task,"Important to mm "
A,Task,"because if you get new information comm it's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible comm "
A,Task,"because you would avoid making doing extra work comm "
A,Task,"because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side . "
A,Task,"So I think that could have been better . "
A,Task,"But that's I think it's more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh than somewhere else . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm well "
B,Task,"it could also possibly be well comm is it a more real-time information base comm "
B,Task,"so we can all see which information is available to one another . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
A,Task,"And l less p less spam probably . "
A,Elicit,"I'm not sure i I'm not sure you got spammed as well comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"but I get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a there was another email about master classes or something . "
C,Minor,"Ah . "
C,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"which were totally useless actually . "
A,Task,"I thought I should probably look into them comm "
A,Task,"but they were all useless . "
A,Minor,"So I just "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I personally did not have that comm "
D,Minor,"Mm "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Other,"Oh okay . "
B,Task,"That's probably your l description . "
B,Minor,"But I also didn't not really . But still comm "
B,Elicit,"you had that as well . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Task,"Is that we finished up the design "
B,Task,"and then we checked the website comm "
B,Task,"and then there was just extra information . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"after After five minutes comm uh "
C,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"There was a little delay in the bit of a c crucial delay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I didn't have any uh more information comm "
A,Task,"it's just always the same here . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"So that's that's kind of a "
D,Minor,"Email uh "
A,Task,"It would change comm but not for me . "
A,Task,"So I'd I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"I couldn't do any research myself "
A,Minor,"or I see comm that's "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Minor,"w "
A,Task,"I could have done a little extra work probably comm "
A,Minor,"then "
D,Minor,"it's "
A,Task,"But I was busy enough anyway . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Any new ideas found ? "
A,Minor,"Or is that a 'cause "
C,Minor,"No . "
A,Minor,"uh yeah comm it's well comm "
A,Task,"probably is . "
B,Elicit,"How much time do we have for this anyway ? "
A,Task,"I have no clue . "
A,Minor,"That's like ohcommbut it "
A,Minor,"Should i "
C,Minor,". "
A,Task,"if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget comm we should celebrate . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Other,"bring out the beer . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Champagne . "
A,Minor,"Uh okay comm "
D,Task,"I want one for my own . "
A,Task,"think that's about it . Uh "
A,Task,"I'm not sure what we should still do though "
A,Minor,"uh t let's see "
A,Minor,"what "
A,Task,"all your tasks were finished comm "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"What you ha from your assistant . So let's "
C,Task,"I have no more email . "
C,Task,"My coach is uh being very silent now . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
D,Minor,"my personal coach i "
A,Minor,"I should I think I sh "
A,Task,"I still have the the total report to finish up . "
A,Task,"I think we took very little time now comm "
A,Minor,"because "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"we're in agreement comm "
A,Minor,"everything "
A,Task,"the design is okay . "
A,Task,"The one thing we missed though comm we don't have a product name . "
D,Minor,"What "
C,Task,"No comm "
A,Elicit,"How about you cook a how about you cook up a product name ? "
C,Task,"we haven't think above about that . "
B,Other,"Product name . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm name . "
C,Task,"Huh . It's better than thi I think than a serial number . "
C,Task,"Sony uh T_R_ something uh f means nothing to me . Uh "
D,Task,"Or fruit name . "
A,Minor,"Just "
A,Task,"oh comm think of a catchy name . "
A,Other,"I'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Like fruit names . "
D,Task,"Fruit name or something like that . "
D,Task,"The banana remote or something . "
A,Other,"What ? Fruit ? "
A,Task,"You don't want it to resemble a banana . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it's the form of it . "
B,Minor,"The bana "
A,Task,"It's not yellow anyway . "
B,Task,"'cause it's not yellow anymore . "
D,Other,"Yeah oh comm yeah . "
A,Task,"It's not yellow anymore . "
A,Task,"It is curved comm "
A,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah . Uh "
B,Minor,"Well comm uh "
B,Task,"I was going for the R_C_ deluxe comm "
B,Task,"but it's not really a catchy name or anything comm "
B,Minor,"it's more "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"it's "
C,Task,"Uh at least it's not something with numbers . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Numbers are so meaningless to the people . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I mean "
B,Task,"Something with our company name comm "
D,Task,"That's true . "
B,Elicit,"can we do anything with that ? "
C,Minor,". "
D,Other,"Reaction comm Real Reaction . "
B,Task,"Maybe there's something on the website which will help us out . "
C,Other,"Real Reaction . "
B,Task,"The reaction deluxe . "
A,Task,"Real Reaction future R_C_ . "
A,Task,"Step into the future of of remote controlling your T_V_ . "
B,Elicit,"Is that a name or a c campaign ? "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"that's a that's a catchy slogan . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Or the "
A,Task,"Control your remote control . "
B,Task,"The real reactor . "
C,Minor,"Real react . "
A,Task,"I go for future R_C_ probably . "
A,Minor,"Something like It's short f "
C,Task,"The Real Reactor comm I don't find that uh that bad at all . "
D,Minor,". "
A,Other,"Real reactor ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You should write it down as a an option . "
C,Task,"Because our name is Real Reaction . "
A,Minor,"Uh that that's "
A,Task,"That makes me think of different products than a remote control really . "
D,Minor,". "
A,Task,"I'm not sure . "
A,Minor,"Real reaction in a real "
D,Minor,"Zapping . The "
B,Task,"So that's one option . "
A,Other,"Real reactor . "
A,Other,"Didn't notice . "
C,Task,"I'm looking for things in the name . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So that the first three letters are s the same . R_E_A_ R_E_A_ . "
B,Elicit,"Should I write the banana down or "
D,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
A,Minor,"I take f "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"Sure ? "
A,Other,"take a banana . "
D,Other,"The banana . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Remote . Banana recei R_C_ . "
C,Task,"The triple R_ . Real Reaction remotes control . Triple R_ . "
D,Task,"Remote . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"I "
D,Task,"R_ three C_ . "
