B,Other,"If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
D,Elicit,"Is that someone's ? "
B,Minor,"Is that . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Minor,"three comm apparently . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"you all switched on . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yep comm me too . "
B,Task,"I presume we're good to go . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm um "
B,Other,"minutes "
B,Task,"um we decided to use a kinetic charger comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"standard chip comm um 'cause it can come in various different sizes comm "
B,Task,"it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor . "
B,Task,"We wanted a stand-by function . "
B,Task,"The case material is gonna be soft comm rubbery comm changeable . "
B,Task,"Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . "
B,Task,"Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit comm keeping with the hip kind of feel . "
B,Task,"Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . "
B,Task,"Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . "
B,Elicit,"Okay ? "
B,Task,"Prototype presentation . "
C,Elicit,"Is that for us ? "
B,Task,"I think that would be you . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Me and William worked on a prototype comm "
A,Task,"and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"shall I show ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"I'll show . "
C,Elicit,"Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it "
B,Minor,"Make sure the camera's "
A,Other,"I can hold it like "
C,Other,"and I'll I'll show you the presentation . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"so "
C,Elicit,"Can I just nick your "
B,Task,"Yes comm yes you can . "
B,Task,"Wait a second comm "
B,Other,"I'll get it out . "
C,Other,"Whoa . "
A,Minor,"It looks "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"Going a bit crazy over here . "
A,Minor,"crazy . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Task,"You should have one of those things "
A,Other,"Um not now . Oh . "
B,Task,"and you can just take it off . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Ta-da . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Elicit,"where are the hinges ? "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so "
C,Task,"this is our look and feel presentation comm the final our final presentation . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Task,"And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour comm either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . "
A,Elicit,"You able to look ? "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"um which there'd be sort of a wide choice "
C,Task,"they would be attached comm "
C,Task,"but we can we can come up with that . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns comm "
C,Task,"so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . "
C,Task,"Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design "
C,Task,"and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say comm it's yeah yeah comm it would be sort of inset into the into the top "
A,Minor,". "
A,Elicit,"The black and white touch screen "
A,Minor,"wherein people can "
B,Task,"Mm . So it's flush . "
C,Minor,"and the buttons at the bottom would d "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"so so it'll fully close flat . "
B,Other,"Oh right comm okay comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"yeah . "
C,Other,"And working on the inside "
C,Task,"we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries comm "
C,Task,"which actually comm thinking about it now comm could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well comm "
C,Minor,"so that you could probably get a bit of "
B,Elicit,"So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"'cause it's the top part that's "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"okay . "
C,Task,"Um we decided that um the voice recognition system comm it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in "
C,Task,"and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of comm "
C,Task,"so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . "
C,Task,"So you'd have something like where you'd shout out comm where where is the remote and it'll shout back comm I'm here comm or something . "
C,Minor,"And then "
D,Other,"Or something . "
C,Other,"yeah . "
C,Task,"It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . "
C,Task,"It'll just shout out I'm here comm or something to similar effect . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"I'm under the sofa . "
A,Minor,"Ah oka "
B,Task,"Or comm that would be too complicated . "
C,Minor,"Uh yeah comm "
C,Minor,"if it was going like I d "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"tha that could be something for next time comm maybe . "
C,Task,"You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . "
C,Task,"Um the standard comm there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . "
B,Minor,"Infrared . "
C,Minor,"Um it would it would have "
C,Task,"obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers comm "
C,Task,"it would need two separate P_C_B_s comm "
C,Task,"so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . "
C,Task,"And uh because comm obviously comm all T_V_s use this comm the same infrared medium comm "
C,Task,"we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . "
C,Task,"And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer comm just at the front of the "
C,Minor,"we haven't "
C,Task,"I don't think we actually put it on . "
B,Elicit,"Like here . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm something like that . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Infrared could be here also . Yeah comm here . "
B,Task,"Actually comm no comm "
B,Task,"it would be it would have to be on the on the front . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm on the front on the front side of that comm yeah . "
A,Task,". So when it's even if it's open here comm the signals would go . "
B,Other,"Oh right comm yeah comm okay comm yeah comm I've got you . "
B,Task,"It's still pointing comm "
C,Task,"So when you've actually got it open comm it would be facing the T_V_ . "
B,Other,"yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that would make sense . "
C,Other,"And then finally um on to the interface . "
C,Task,"The top screen comm as we said comm is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen "
C,Task,"which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it comm "
A,Task,"This one right here . "
C,Task,"uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons comm like the vo volume up and down comm channel up and down comm power on and off comm and uh things to that effect . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Task,"And now we've we also decided on the inside comm we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it comm or something inset comm or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . "
A,Minor,"Which is "
B,Elicit,"But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product "
C,Task,"No d not not actually . No comm not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"once it's "
A,Other,"Look up to it . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics comm "
C,Task,"as that is that's the company logo . "
B,Other,"Thank you very much . "
A,Other,"Yay . "
B,Task,"Wrapping it all up comm "
D,Other,"Well done . "
B,Minor,"okay . "
B,Task,"Um I've now got evaluation criteria . "
D,Task,"Certainly . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"this is the one . "
A,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Minor,"It's to be presented . "
C,Task,"There you go . . "
D,Other,"Logged in ? "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Other,"Oops . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Evaluation . "
A,Minor,". "
A,Task,"Mm um I I think this is chip . "
B,Task,"It's quite similar to what it was before comm though . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
D,Task,"This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . "
D,Task,"So this is the first stage of the evaluation . "
D,Minor,"Now comm "
D,Task,"the collection of the criteria comm as we saw in our previous meeting comm was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . "
D,Task,"So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting comm "
D,Elicit,"are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? "
D,Minor,"Now "
D,Task,"the findings that we came up with comm just a recap comm are here . "
D,Task,"The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel comm technological innovation comm it should be easy to use comm it should incorporate current fashion trends comm "
D,Task,"and those the two main ones comm they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"The design should minimise R_S_I_ "
D,Task,"and be easy to locate "
D,Task,"and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there comm "
D,Task,"though that did seem to be the favoured strategy comm "
D,Task,"but there was also comm on the sideline comm the though of maybe having a beeper function . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so "
D,Task,"we can come back to that slide comm if you don't have a note of those . "
D,Other,"I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this comm to what we have so far . "
D,Task,"We're going to use a seven point scale comm "
D,Task,"where one is true "
D,Task,"and seven is false . "
D,Task,"We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned comm "
D,Other,"I'll call that slide back up comm "
D,Other,"and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"Does that seem clear ? "
D,Elicit,"Any questions there ? "
A,Other,"Ah comm it's perfect . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"we're going to look at these crite "
A,Elicit,"Is it everybody is going to evaluate comm or just the Market "
D,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Other,"okay . "
D,Minor,"we're going to come to "
D,Task,"w we'll discuss each one "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Is that okay ? "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"One is true comm "
D,Task,"seven is false . "
D,Minor,"Right . So "
D,Other,"I won't write all of that out again . "
D,Other,"It will just be criteria one comm two comm three comm four comm five comm six comm "
D,Task,"or A_ comm B_ comm C_ comm D_ comm E_ comm F_ "
D,Task,"to confuse it with the number rating . "
D,Other,"B_ comm C_ comm D_ comm E_ comm F_ . "
D,Other,"This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . "
B,Task,"Just write small . "
D,Other,"Criteria and rating . "
D,Task,"Actually comm it might be an idea comm if we each did give our own individual rating comm "
D,Task,"and we could take an average at the end . "
D,Elicit,"How about that ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . That works . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"so you can "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques comm "
D,Task,"and if we go one comm two comm three comm four comm we know who's who . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Criteria A_ comm the fancy look and feel . "
D,Elicit,"How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel . "
D,Task,"One is true comm "
D,Task,"seven is false . "
D,Task,"My own rating for that would be a two . "
D,Task,"One is true "
D,Task,"and seven is false . "
B,Task,"I would agree . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah comm "
D,Other,"I'll just go this way . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"two or three . "
D,Other,"Two . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"three . Three . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I would say two . "
D,Other,"Two . "
A,Task,"I would say four . "
D,Other,"A four comm okay . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"Adding those up comm we've got a six and a five comm eleven divided by four is what ? "
D,Elicit,"Uh two and three quarters comm it that right . "
C,Task,"Mm yeah . "
A,Task,"Almost three . "
D,Elicit,"Two and three quarters ? "
A,Task,"I think yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Other,"Okay . Two point seven five comm there we go . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Elicit,"criteria B_ comm criterion B_ comm technologically innovative . "
D,Task,"I would give that a three . "
C,Task,"I'd give it a one . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Not that you're biased in that it the designer . "
C,Other,"No comm no comm not at all . "
B,Task,"A two . "
A,Minor,"Oh "
A,Other,"sorry comm "
A,Task,"I I got it wrong . The first one rating comm "
A,Other,"I'm sorry . "
A,Task,"Can you just make it two ? The first . "
D,Elicit,"The average "
D,Other,"oh comm for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I I just it the other way . "
A,Minor,"Uh in "
A,Task,"Yep comm "
A,Minor,"I just got "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Other,"I'll work out the average for that again at the end . "
D,Task,"It's a very slightly altered "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Elicit,"and we're just waiting for your rating "
A,Minor,"two point f "
B,Task,"It's just two point five for that one . "
D,Minor,"f "
D,Other,"Two point five comm okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Losing one decimal place comm that's okay . "
A,Task,"One is a comm "
A,Task,"seven is false comm "
A,Other,"okay . "
D,Elicit,"So what are you rating for this one comm Paw ? "
A,Task,"Two . "
D,Other,"Two comm okay . "
D,Task,"So that is eight . "
D,Task,"That brings it down to two comm "
D,Task,"nice and simple comm "
C,Task,"Two . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"ease of use . "
D,Elicit,"Easy to use ? "
D,Task,"Based on what you've said there comm I would say a one comm true . "
C,Task,"Two . "
D,Other,"Two . "
B,Task,"I would say a two . I would say a two . "
D,Other,"A two comm okay . "
A,Task,"Two . "
D,Other,"Two . "
D,Other,"I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy comm shouldn't I ? "
D,Other,"We'll just put almost two comm "
D,Other,"because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . "
B,Task,"One point seven f five . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay comm mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Or we or if we want to really bring it down comm we can do later . "
D,Task,"Um mm now we're looking at "
C,Task,"D_ . "
D,Elicit,"it incorporates current fashion trends comm "
D,Task,"now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . "
C,Task,"One . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right . So "
D,Task,"I'm just thinking comm before I give it my rating comm you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? "
C,Minor,"that's "
C,Task,"No comm no comm "
C,Task,"the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue comm "
A,Task,"White . "
A,Minor,"With "
A,Task,"for the plastic ? Uh blue . "
C,Task,"but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Any "
D,Elicit,"So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . "
A,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"And the spongy feel is no problem with that . "
C,Minor,"and "
C,Task,"No comm no comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"because you'll be having a Because of the rubber case . "
C,Task,"'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it comm "
C,Task,"that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"In that case it's got to be a one for me . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I'll give it a one as well . "
D,Other,"Yep . "
D,Elicit,"Everybody ? "
B,Task,"One . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"One . "
D,Task,"That part was nice and easy . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Okay . Uh "
D,Task,"moving on "
D,Elicit,"to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . "
D,Task,"I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"We've we've discussed it comm "
D,Task,"we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . "
D,Task,"We've talked about pointers comm "
D,Elicit,"but the very use of a remote control comm if you're someone who's zapping comm who's sitting like that comm and we found so many people did comm how do you minimise that on such a small device ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half comm the material comm minimises R_S_I_ "
C,Task,"It's meant to be . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"it's meant to . Um "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"maybe because it's slightl "
B,Task,"with the size that we've got it's quite small comm "
B,Task,"but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"So maybe because there's more space comm "
B,Task,"it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Other,"I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that "
D,Task,"and give it a four . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five comm actually comm "
D,Other,"A five comm okay . "
C,Minor,"'cause "
B,Task,"Four . "
D,Other,"Four "
D,Other,"and a four okay . "
A,Task,"Four . "
D,Elicit,"Twenty one is that twenty one ? "
D,Elicit,"So that's four point two five . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"And finally comm last but not least comm easy to locate . "
D,Task,"Now we talked about voice recognition comm "
D,Task,"we talked about a beeper comm "
D,Minor,"have we really "
D,Elicit,"have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it was it was uh a voice voice recognition comm "
A,Task,"Voice r recognition . "
D,Task,"It was the I'm here thing comm "
D,Other,"yep . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Elicit,"And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible comm cost-wise . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm that yeah comm that's feasible . "
D,Task,"That sounds good then . "
D,Minor,"I'd go for a I ca "
D,Task,"we can adjust the volume on that comm just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms comm or . "
C,Minor,"Um I think it would r "
C,Task,"I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand "
B,Task,"A standard . "
C,Task,"it would be quite loud . "
B,Task,"It would be . "
D,Other,"Right . Okay . "
C,Minor,"So it would be s p "
D,Elicit,"You built into the feature . "
B,Task,"And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in comm then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room comm you'd go into another room . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Logical . "
D,Task,"That's a one for me . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm one . "
D,Other,"One "
B,Task,"One . "
D,Other,"and one comm "
D,Other,"good . "
C,Task,"I do realise that we might be being fairly biased comm "
C,Task,"'cause it is our product comm "
C,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Elicit,"how do we feel about this ? "
D,Task,"We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . "
D,Task,"The lowest rating we've got comm which is really n it's not terribly low comm "
D,Task,"i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . "
D,Elicit,"Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it comm "
D,Elicit,"or do we have to make further modifications ? "
B,Task,"I don't think so . "
C,Minor,"W I thin "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"We happy to go ahead ? "
C,Minor,"I think "
B,Task,"I think we yeah . I think we're set . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that comm "
D,Task,"and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities comm we could actually do much more to minimise that . "
B,Task,"Do much apart from having a huge big "
C,Task,"Mm . "
D,Other,"I know . "
D,Minor,"Okay . Well comm "
D,Elicit,"I hope that's uh clear to the team . "
D,Elicit,"Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings "
D,Other,"before I sum up ? "
B,Task,"Don't think so . "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Other,"Good . Fine then . "
D,Other,"I'll just leave it there . "
D,Other,"Oops . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Other,"thank you . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"I've got finance here now . "
B,Other,"I'm gonna plug this in "
B,Task,"so you can all see it comm "
B,Elicit,"if that's okay . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
D,Other,"Oh yes . "
A,Elicit,"You want me to b unplug that ? "
A,Task,"That's all . Yes . "
B,Other,"Thanks . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Now "
B,Task,"I presume that the screen will go blank comm "
B,Minor,"that um "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"We just type numbers into this "
B,Task,"and we come out with the final value . "
B,Elicit,"So are we still on for kinetic ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"See comm it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . "
B,Task,"Um it might have influenced our choice . "
B,Minor,"Right comm "
B,Elicit,"what's happening with the electronics ? "
C,Task,"It was a regular chip on print "
A,Task,"Chip on print . "
C,Minor,"and "
B,Elicit,"Double-curved . "
C,Minor,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"no comm no comm no comm "
C,Minor,"the um "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"it's "
C,Task,"you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells comm "
C,Task,"there should just be one . "
C,Task,"In the top comm it's the number "
C,Minor,"of c yeah . "
B,Other,"Oh comm right comm "
B,Task,"okay . "
B,Other,"Thanks . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"and "
B,Elicit,"So comm would there be two ? "
C,Minor,"yeah comm just a "
C,Task,"no comm "
C,Minor,"one reg v uh "
B,Elicit,"One chip . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"And they're double curved . "
C,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"Y "
A,Task,"Single-curved . "
B,Elicit,"One double curve . "
C,Task,"Two comm "
C,Task,"'cause it's two . "
A,Task,"Two curves comm yeah . "
D,Task,"But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"what's a single curve then ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I'd say I'd say it was w "
D,Task,"It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . like a domed thing . "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I think I think it's "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Single-cu "
B,Elicit,"just one double "
D,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"One double-curved . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Um "
A,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"And one "
C,Task,"no comm "
A,Task,"Plastic and rubber . "
C,Task,"'cause one yeah comm one's double-curved comm "
C,Minor,"and then the other one's "
D,Task,"The other curves at the sides comm "
D,Task,"but it's slightly flattened at the bottom "
D,Task,"so it doesn't roll over . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Um we've got plastic and rubber comm "
C,Minor,"a plastic . "
B,Elicit,"haven't we ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Plastic one "
A,Task,"and maybe rubber point five . "
C,Task,"And special colour . "
B,Minor,". "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"I think rubber comm since it's being used just as a casing comm "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"we can put point five . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Do you think ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think it allows the point five comm "
A,Elicit,"yeah . "
A,Task,"We can use that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"What does it mean if you put point five for that ? "
A,Task,"It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . "
A,Task,"We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic . "
B,Minor,"It would be like saying we're using "
B,Task,"See comm it says case material . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"we're not actually using plastic in the case comm "
C,Task,"No comm no comm "
B,Elicit,"are we ? "
C,Task,"that's it's as an extra . "
B,Task,"It's including comm it's including . "
D,Other,"Right comm okay . "
C,Task,"So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there comm "
C,Task,"because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get . "
D,Task,"But it is gonna be part of the total cost comm "
D,Task,"and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in comm "
D,Elicit,"is there ? "
D,Task,"There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . "
D,Elicit,"So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? "
B,Task,"Okay comm we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Or sh we should just put it in as one comm "
B,Task,"because the plastic is zero anyway . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
B,Other,"No comm we don't step on anyone's toes . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Elicit,"special colour comm do we need that ? "
D,Task,"Might do comm if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . "
B,Minor,"N "
B,Other,"yeah comm okay . "
B,Elicit,"Interface . "
A,Task,"Push-button . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"the push-button's one "
A,Minor,"One . "
C,Task,"and L_C_ display one . "
A,Minor,"An One . "
C,Minor,"And buttons "
B,Minor,"Buttons "
D,Minor,"S "
A,Task,"I think we could change the battery also . "
A,Elicit,"Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery . "
D,Minor,"Has that not made any d "
D,Task,"if you click off that square now comm "
D,Elicit,"has that not made any difference ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"Is it "
B,Elicit,"Has that not gone up ? "
D,Minor,"oh comm "
C,Task,"yes . "
D,Task,"it's brought it slightly down . "
B,Task,"Oh no comm "
B,Task,"it was seven five "
B,Task,"it's changed not a lot . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"is is uncurved completely "
D,Task,"and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing comm "
D,Elicit,"is that going to make a difference ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Uncurved comm flat . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"it's not made any difference comm "
D,Elicit,"has it? . "
C,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"It's gone up again . "
A,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"we'll have "
A,Task,"it just surprises one . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"it's not calculated it . "
C,Task,"No comm no comm "
C,Task,"you've got to click off to calculate it again . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"Okay comm there we go . "
D,Task,"It's brought it down slightly . "
C,Minor,"C "
B,Task,"It's not a lot though . "
C,Minor,"it might uh "
C,Task,"you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . "
A,Task,". I don't think so . "
C,Task,"It could be in Dollars . "
C,Task,"And then it would be fine comm "
C,Task,"because the exchange range would make it about twelve . "
D,Minor,"Is there anything on the menu "
B,Task,"We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though comm "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"I think "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"Ri "
A,Task,"I think it's in Euro . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"so the highest we've got is the electronics here . Um and the interface . "
D,Minor,"If we tr um . "
D,Elicit,"If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries comm would that make a huge difference ? "
A,Minor,"And going to a regular bat "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"the standard comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"it um it would make one difference . "
C,Minor,"The biggest one would be taking away if you took away "
A,Task,"What I feel is comm customers never said anything about the battery . "
C,Minor,"If you to "
A,Task,"It's internal comm "
A,Task,"nobody looks into the battery . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But shape and colours comm that's something we shouldn't comprimi "
D,Task,"And people are used to buying batteries comm "
C,Minor,"If if you take away the voice comm "
D,Task,"they're not gonna say I'm not getting this comm 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control . "
C,Task,"I I do I don't like to say it comm "
C,Task,"but if you take away the voice recognition comm then you've got it . "
A,Elicit,"Where's that special form ? Mm mm mm . "
D,Elicit,"Should we see what difference it makes ? "
B,Minor,"Where's the "
C,Minor,"Yeah i yeah . "
C,Task,"No "
B,Elicit,"where's the voice recognition ? "
C,Task,"'cause it's samples sens sample speaker . "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Other,"Right comm okay . "
C,Task,"If you took away that comm that'll make it twelve point three five . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"the kinetic is three . "
B,Task,"If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three . "
C,Minor,"They n n "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Minor,"but you p "
C,Task,"minus three plus two . "
B,Other,"Oh comm right . "
B,Task,"I keep seeing zero . "
B,Task,"Um We can do it some other way comm "
B,Minor,"we can do "
B,Task,"it doesn't have to be voice recognition . "
B,Task,"We could do the voice recognition for comm you know comm business class or something comm you know comm like an upgraded version . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"You could choose to have that or not . "
C,Minor,"But they but I mean in "
C,Elicit,"I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now comm "
C,Task,"because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . "
D,Minor,"But we're still working to um head o "
B,Elicit,"So should we just change the design specification then ? "
D,Task,"We can put in our recommendations . "
A,Task,"Make it costly . "
D,Task,"If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for comm we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"We c we could s "
D,Task,"But we need to work to that specification to start with . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful comm "
C,Minor,"we could say "
D,Task,"but our object is so distinctive "
D,Task,"that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . "
D,Task,"Um as you say comm we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"we can make the price fit comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I s "
B,Task,"and then say if we'd had our budget comm we would've had this comm "
C,Task,"And then say we recommend "
D,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"because it also sets it apart from the crowd . "
D,Task,"'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it . "
B,Task,"They like their gadgets comm "
B,Task,"they like something that's completely different . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's s something completely different associated with your company . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Right comm okay comm so "
D,Task,"So if we take voice recognition out "
C,Task,"That'll do it . Twelve point three five . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"we are close to the budget . "
D,Minor,"we are . "
C,Elicit,"Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? "
A,Task,"Two five . "
B,Task,"It's two point five . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"it's twelve point two five . "
D,Task,"Are you sure ? "
D,Other,"Sorry comm not meaning to doubt your words there . "
B,Minor,"Yeah well "
B,Task,"two comm twelve point two five times two is twenty five comm "
D,Other,"Right . "
D,Elicit,"Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? Or point zero one of a Euro ? "
B,Task,"isn't it ? "
A,Task,"It's twelve point five maybe comm then . "
D,Task,"Which is less than ten P_ . "
A,Minor,"I don't know what "
A,Task,"it said fifty percent of the cost . "
A,Minor,"So half of the price would be "
B,Task,"I think the agenda one was where the um price was comm "
B,Task,"wasn't it ? "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"I think it is the first one . "
D,Task,"That's today's "
D,Other,"kick off meeting comm . "
B,Task,"Twelve point five . "
D,Task,"Mm . I thought that's what it was . "
C,Other,"Ah . "
A,Task,"So we are under the budget . "
B,Other,"Well done comm people . "
D,Task,"So we're okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"is "
B,Elicit,"that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? "
B,Elicit,"We don't need something else to take that place ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra comm "
C,Task,"you could just take that out and that would be fine comm yeah . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Seems fine . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I think that's brilliant . "
A,Minor,"Except voice recognition comm everything is "
B,Minor,"Right comm "
B,Task,"so we've done that . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Product evaluation . "
B,Task,"We've done room for creativity comm "
B,Elicit,"haven't we ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make . Um "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"um in the sense that "
B,Elicit,"um did you feel like a team ? "
B,Elicit,"Or did you feel like uh autonomy ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I'd say comm as a team . "
D,Task,"Although we had our separate tasks comm "
A,Task,"I think we had a nice time . "
D,Task,"there was so much interaction comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . "
C,Task,"Find out from each other comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"And I've certainly felt heard comm listened to "
D,Task,"in that in relevant areas we've been able to comm you know comm give and take "
D,Task,"and adjust our remit where necessary . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . "
A,Task,"It's not like people trying to cut each other . "
A,Task,"There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . "
A,Task,"We came to a very predic creative design comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm and uh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think . "
A,Task,"And Sarah comm you coordinated the work very well . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Elicit,"How did you find it ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm no comm "
C,Task,"I thought it it went really well "
C,Minor,"and I "
C,Task,"yeah comm I I feel that everyone was listened to "
C,Task,"and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out comm "
C,Task,"although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there comm "
C,Task,"but that's that's good . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out comm I think maybe it would've come out a d little different comm "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea comm but no one felt like shot down comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"you know comm "
B,Minor,"y "
B,Task,"it didn't matter it saying what you thought comm "
B,Task,"because if it wasn't something that was that relevant comm then it didn't matter comm "
B,Task,"'cause it was just another idea in the field . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I like that . Um "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"teamwork . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model . "
C,Other,"Yeah comm well . "
A,Task,"I think that was the best part "
B,Other,"Um uh I'm still not caught up . "
A,Minor,"of the "
B,Task,"But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all . Um "
D,Task,"Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . And fake R_C_s . "
B,Task,"Maybe . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Minor,"No comm "
B,Task,"that was quite fun . "
B,Elicit,"Um means comm whiteboard comm digital pens comm etcetera comm what does that mean ? Any ideas ? "
D,Task,"How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? "
C,Task,"Discuss which ones "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Could it've been better comm "
D,Elicit,"was it adequate ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more comm had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more . "
B,Minor,"Had time to kind of "
D,Task,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"'cause we could just sort of say comm sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that comm rather than having to email it comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But it was nice having it there . Um like the whole picture of the thing . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"moving around the room . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But I think it's good comm "
A,Task,"like uh we spent times individually . "
A,Task,"I never thought of a remote control with a flip top . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I think it's new ideas in general comm "
D,Task,"It's really borrowing from other areas comm it's comm you know comm bringing things from other areas in comm "
B,Minor,"rather than "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"it so it's "
D,Task,"I mean nothing is new comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"but it's applying it to a d in a different area . "
C,Task,"Vegetables . "
A,Task,"That's mine . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm no . Well "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"it's "
B,Task,"they have to come from somewhere comm "
B,Elicit,"don't they ? "
D,Task,"Absolutely comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"The thing is "
B,Minor,"And as sh as w "
B,Other,"sorry comm "
B,Task,"you go . "
A,Other,"Yep comm sorry comm "
A,Task,"go on Sarah . "
B,Task,"Um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls comm remote controls comm no one's thought about it particularly . "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I mean they're slightly different comm "
B,Task,"so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's comm "
B,Task,"'cause it's w something we should think about comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I do "
C,Task,"I don't think the the companies are really concerned . "
C,Task,"They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player comm "
C,Task,"does anyone remember the remote control ? "
C,Elicit,"Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"just jazz it up a bit . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Uh d they don't really think about it comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"because normally comm the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . "
C,Task,"They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player comm the video player comm the T_V_ . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm the focus isn't on to that comm yeah . "
B,Task,"But then when it everything is really smart comm and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table comm it doesn't go comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing comm a funky item that's individual comm individual to you comm "
C,Minor,"No . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea "
B,Task,"and they design it on Photoshop "
B,Task,"and then they just get it printed on the plastic comm "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"you would pray "
B,Task,"you would pay a lot extra comm "
B,Task,"because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But people could have anything that they wanted . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones comm like a real want to see a new launch or something like that . "
B,Minor,"Because of the produ "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And new f television products coming up comm "
A,Task,"but nobody giving uh much idea to this . "
D,Task,"I think it's really good that this has been very market research based comm "
A,Minor,"Like Sarah was telling comm everything's "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"because just going back to mobile phones comm I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really comm you know comm say is is obvious and visible . "
D,Task,"We see it in mobile phones a lot comm "
D,Task,"and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . "
D,Task,"There are innovations in that that people don't really want . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with comm "
D,Task,"and they can't get it anymore "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and it's innovation for innovation's sake comm "
D,Task,"and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"it's innovation for money's sake . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"The the people have to keep buying . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But forcing it onto people comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"It's things that comm "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Task,"they might want to buy the thing they really want . "
B,Minor,"And you can't get "
B,Task,"you've got your handset that works fine comm "
B,Task,"but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
B,Task,"because the phones have moved on comm things like that . "
D,Task,"Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever comm "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"It's madness . Um "
D,Minor,"See I think "
B,Task,"In closing There we go . "
B,Task,"Um our costs are below budget "
B,Task,"with recommendations that they the budget be increased comm "
B,Minor,"but I think "
B,Task,"I don't know comm "
B,Minor,"d "
B,Elicit,"what do you think ? "
B,Elicit,"Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building comm do you think our budget includes everything comm all the costs that are going out ? "
C,Minor,"Well . "
D,Task,"I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone . "
C,Task,"I think that was just the the physical . "
B,Task,"So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit comm "
B,Task,"you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"So maybe increasing it comm you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Maybe fifty percent more . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I think "
B,Minor,"But I think but you were saying that that's quite "
C,Minor,"yeah "
D,Task,"But I think in the remit that we were given comm it was very specific . "
C,Minor,"I don't from the market research . "
D,Task,"I think we've done what we were required to do comm "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . "
D,Task,"I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"it was "
D,Task,"I think we've done very well to get within budget "
D,Task,"and it still makes such an innovative item "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"that I think people are really gonna want . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's a shame it won't ever get made . "
D,Task,"I know . "
B,Task,"Maybe it will . "
D,Task,"Maybe it will . "
A,Task,"Who knows ? "
D,Task,"Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas "
B,Task,"Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it . "
C,Other,"I it's top secret . Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here . That's what it is . "
D,Task,"and sell it . "
B,Task,"Um the project has been evaluated well and truly . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . "
A,Task,"There's a final questionnaire . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm so "
B,Task,"we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with comm "
B,Other,"so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor comm "
C,Minor,"In your "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Other,"so good luck . "
A,Elicit,"Celebration comm you didn't talk about that . "
B,Task,"I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds . "
B,Task,"Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"Questionnaire . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Is that it then ? "
B,Task,"Um yeah comm just the last comm I think . "
C,Other,"Awesome . "
B,Task,"I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy . "
D,Task,"Questionnaire done . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time . "
C,Elicit,"Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your thing ? "
D,Other,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"right . "
D,Elicit,"But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ? "
C,Task,"I don't think . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"the the s "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Task,"I think yeah comm questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"I just got con "
