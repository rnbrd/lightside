A,Other,"Hello . "
D,Other,"Hey guys . "
C,Other,"Hi . "
B,Other,"Hi . "
A,Other,"Hi . "
C,Task,"I see my bunny is still standing . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"No one drawing it . "
A,Other,"It's too beautiful . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm true . "
C,Task,"Uh I figured uh that much . "
D,Other,"Too wicked . "
B,Other,"Mm . "
A,Task,"A minute please comm "
A,Task,"my uh laptop is uh "
A,Minor,"oh comm "
A,Task,"there it is comm "
A,Other,"thank you . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"welcome back . At the functional design meeting um "
A,Task,"the plan is uh that uh each one of you comm so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . "
A,Task,"I will uh take minutes "
A,Task,"and will put uh the minutes that I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder . "
A,Task,"Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now comm "
A,Task,"so you can read that uh now or afterwards . Um "
A,Task,"uh I had an email from the from the management board "
A,Elicit,"uh comm I don't know if you a al also uh received it comm "
A,Task,"but there were four points "
A,Task,"uh which uh I think are very important . "
A,Task,"First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated "
A,Task,"uh and internet will be the the main uh focus . "
A,Task,"Uh second one is also important "
A,Task,"uh comm because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . "
A,Task,"Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television comm "
A,Task,"so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control comm "
A,Task,"so uh that's one thing to keep in mind . "
A,Task,"Uh second comm and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert comm "
A,Task,"uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older comm "
A,Task,"but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . "
A,Minor,"Uh and uh "
A,Task,"I think to keep in mind comm but not really uh for now "
A,Task,"is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"we have uh forty minutes comm "
A,Task,"so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each comm "
A,Task,"and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards comm the the Word files comm what you uh whatever you want . "
A,Minor,"So uh "
A,Task,"Tim comm can you start ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Yeah ? "
D,Minor,"'Kay comm "
D,Other,"welcome . "
D,Task,"I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"which I will show you . "
D,Task,"The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire . "
D,Task,"Um one hundred respondents were involved "
D,Task,"and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results . "
D,Task,"Um comm these were a couple of findings comm first page of three . "
D,Task,"Um comm we have three audiences of "
D,Task,"two audiences comm "
D,Other,"I'm sorry . "
D,Task,"Uh the first one comm this scale comm from sixteen to forty five age . "
D,Task,"Uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five . "
D,Task,"Um comm as you can see here comm the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five . "
D,Task,"Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . "
D,Task,"Mm and some interests from the from the age groups comm "
D,Task,"uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff comm like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control comm um speech recognition . "
D,Task,"I don't think that's uh really appropriate . "
D,Task,"Um comm and when you see uh the audience comm the age is going up uh Yeah comm they don't really want it anymore comm at least the new technologies . "
D,Task,"Second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . "
D,Task,"First point is comm seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly comm "
D,Task,"uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . "
D,Task,"So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"third findings . "
D,Task,"According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation comm um following buttons are most important . "
D,Other,"Um comm I will tell something about the way this uh this test was comm yeah comm done . "
D,Task,"Um comm persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most comm how much an hour comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . "
D,Task,"Um comm when you multiply them comm you get the these three points . "
D,Task,"Switching channels comm um yeah comm "
D,Task,"that's pretty uh pretty normal comm "
D,Task,"that's what you do with a remote control . "
D,Task,"Um the second comm teletext comm "
D,Task,"uh and the third comm uh volume controls . "
D,Task,"Um comm I think it's good uh that we know what the user want wants comm "
D,Task,"uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear . "
A,Task,"But it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"So that that's strange . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm "
D,Task,"but uh at the moment uh teletext is Yeah comm th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ comm like getting information . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Minor,"So uh comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"when you ask people comm what do they use comm "
D,Task,"they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"That's ridiculous . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"That's a ne i it "
D,Task,"It's a new technology comm "
D,Task,"but it's not incorporated right now . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"my personal preferences . Um comm "
D,Task,"I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five . "
D,Task,"Mm comm first of all um it's the biggest share comm the biggest audience comm sixty five percent . "
D,Task,"Uh second comm I think you will get the most revenue from i from it . "
D,Minor,"Um comm yeah comm "
D,Task,"people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ comm more than uh people who are el uh elder . "
D,Task,"Um second point comm "
D,Task,"we have to impro improve the most used functions comm as I said here comm switching channels comm teletext and volume controls . "
D,Task,"Third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire comm "
D,Task,"uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller comm "
D,Task,"so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the comm yeah comm of the T_V_ "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"that's a cool idea . "
D,Task,"where you can put the the remote control in . "
D,Task,"Um comm that's about it comm I think . Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"When you mentioned uh improving functions comm what uh what do you mean by that "
D,Task,"Uh not not the r not the functions comm "
C,Elicit,"what what are you think about ? "
D,Task,"but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control . "
C,Task,"Uh comm the funtionability . "
D,Task,"So you can have a remote control full of buttons comm a hundreds hundreds of buttons comm "
D,Task,"but if you don't use them comm yeah it's "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Ah okay comm "
C,Elicit,"so focusing more on the used buttons . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"they have to be on it "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"j just to t to get it done if necessary comm "
D,Task,"but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or "
C,Elicit,"Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions comm "
C,Elicit,"like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm perhaps . "
D,Task,"Just for the minor functions perhaps . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm ma perhaps comm "
C,Task,"just just an idea . "
D,Task,"Just to get less buttons on the remote control comm to make it easier and quicker to learn . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Minor,"'Kay comm "
D,Task,"that's it . "
A,Other,"Thank you comm Tim . "
C,Task,"Uh yeah yeah comm I'll go comm sure . "
A,Task,"Janus comm can you uh "
C,Minor,"Right uh comm "
C,Other,"I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . "
C,Minor,"Well uh "
C,Task,"what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls "
C,Task,"and um I viewed how how they w looked comm "
C,Task,"how they worked comm "
C,Task,"uh what kind of components are involved comm "
C,Task,"and how they are connected together . "
C,Task,"And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised "
C,Other,"and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . "
C,Other,"And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works "
C,Other,"and how we could uh build one "
C,Other,"and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . "
C,Minor,"Um right . Uh well "
C,Task,"what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls "
C,Task,"and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared comm "
C,Task,"not like all probably know . "
C,Task,"And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something comm "
C,Task,"and those uh have a transmitter "
C,Task,"that's also focused on infrared comm "
C,Task,"so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate comm "
C,Task,"so that would mean extra cost for the user "
C,Minor,"and thus uh that's "
C,Task,"that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us . "
C,Task,"So that's probably why most controls are still infrared . "
C,Task,"Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure comm "
C,Task,"so that would probably uh mean lower costs "
C,Minor,"and uh "
C,Minor,"i "
C,Task,"that could mean for us a good thing "
C,Task,"uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote . "
C,Minor,"Well uh "
C,Minor,"as I mentioned ready comm we have some Bluetooth "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"it may be possible comm "
C,Task,"but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget comm "
C,Other,"but that's not for me to decide comm "
C,Task,"but that's maybe something for marketing to look into . "
C,Minor,"F "
C,Task,"because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth or or radio waves comm "
C,Minor,"although "
D,Elicit,"What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ comm connected to the T_V_ ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"actually I have t "
D,Task,"So it's in the wrong product . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice comm "
C,Task,"but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function . "
C,Task,"So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder comm is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . "
C,Task,"If somebody says comm where is the remote comm then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something comm "
C,Task,"I dunno comm "
C,Task,"maybe uh maybe something to look into comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be . "
C,Task,"But it may be uh may be something to explore . "
C,Other,"Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components . "
C,Task,"Uh first you have the energy source . "
C,Task,"The energy source would be a battery comm simple uh battery "
C,Task,"uh that you can find anywhere . "
C,Task,"I figured that would be best comm "
C,Task,"'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one . "
C,Task,"So we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that . "
C,Task,"Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button comm "
C,Task,"but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch "
C,Task,"there is a switch uh between these . "
C,Minor,"When the switch is pressed in a w on this "
C,Task,"this case it switches a button comm "
C,Task,"when a button is prush pushed in comm uh a electric current goes through here comm "
C,Task,"and in uh immediately comm a l a bulb lights up uh "
C,Task,"displaying to the user that something has happened . "
C,Task,"That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking comm well uh did the button be pressed comm w what happened uh . "
C,Task,"Or I press button "
C,Task,"but nothing's happening on the T_V_ comm "
C,Task,"so is is something wrong or something . "
C,Task,"So that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user . "
C,Minor,"Uh w well "
C,Task,"the signal goes via chip "
C,Task,"that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals "
C,Task,"and then it's processed "
C,Task,"and then it's sent to the infrared bulb "
C,Task,"where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . "
C,Task,"And those uh interpreted by the device comm well in this case the television . "
C,Minor,"Uh well "
C,Task,"my personal preferences here comm "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions comm "
C,Task,"just like you said "
C,Minor,"uh well "
C,Minor,"the most users n "
C,Task,"uh you have a lot of buttons "
C,Task,"and you u u use you don't use them comm "
C,Task,"so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those . "
C,Task,"Uh I I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving . "
C,Minor,"So uh "
C,Task,"no input from the television . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that comm "
C,Task,"because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too comm "
C,Minor,"and so "
C,Task,"in order to receive the signals from uh what's on T_V_ and such . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"I figure that would be uh spending too much money and time "
C,Minor,"and "
D,Minor,"Um comm yeah comm "
D,Task,"maybe another problem uh comm "
D,Task,"I think current T_V_s can even send infrared . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Minor,"but what should we uh s I I I f "
C,Task,"I agree with you comm "
C,Elicit,"but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ? "
D,Minor,"Huh . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"'Cause that would be I mean extra components comm extra designs comm um larger g uh remote control . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"These all uh all stuff that we have to take in account . "
C,Task,"So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all . "
C,Minor,"Um comm well "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"we should uh look into the design and the functionability . "
C,Task,"Like I said comm uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions comm "
C,Minor,"or well uh "
C,Task,"just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something comm the usual uh stuff . "
C,Task,"And uh don't overbuild comm "
C,Task,"we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions comm "
C,Task,"but we we should stick to the basics . "
C,Task,"So that was my uh my personal opinion . "
C,Task,"And that was my uh my presentation uh "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"thank you Janus . "
B,Minor,"Yes comm "
B,Other,"I can go ahead . "
A,Other,"You do ? "
A,Task,"The last presentation . "
B,Other,"Last presentation . Okay . "
A,Task,"You have plenty of time comm "
A,Task,"Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes comm "
A,Minor,"so uh "
A,Task,"take your time . "
A,Other,"If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh "
A,Other,"warn you . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Other,"I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions . "
B,Task,"Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design comm technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one comm "
B,Task,"so if you um going to design a remote that looks good comm that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make comm of course comm but also the user friendliness comm "
B,Task,"so tha that's that's some of the main points . "
B,Task,"And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult comm "
B,Task,"so use as as little functions as possible "
B,Task,"or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . "
B,Task,"If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time comm "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see comm "
B,Task,"but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure . "
B,Task,"And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen comm "
B,Task,"but s I don't know in how far that is possible comm "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"since we are sticking to uh um infrared "
B,Task,"and and the remote cannot receive anything comm "
B,Task,"but uh we might uh consider that . "
B,Minor,"Um well comm "
B,Elicit,"of course I I hope this is all clear to you . "
B,Minor,"If you "
B,Task,"you can use remote like this with all the functions comm "
B,Task,"many functions comm "
B,Minor,"but Well comm "
B,Task,"your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . "
B,Task,"You have to be very careful what you push comm "
B,Task,"and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour "
B,Minor,"from "
B,Minor,"uh um yeah well comm "
B,Elicit,"where is it ? Where the hell "
B,Task,"he here I guess "
B,Minor,"and comm yeah comm when you have to uh use something else . "
B,Task,"So just keep it simple comm "
B,Task,"make clear buttons comm easy to use . "
B,Task,"For example if you want to use a play and back and stop comm "
B,Task,"that's very important . "
B,Minor,"Um well "
B,Task,"this was because of our last discussion comm "
B,Task,"if multiple machines are used comm create easy switch between the machines comm "
B,Task,"but um it's no longer uh applying . "
B,Minor,"Well yeah comm "
B,Task,"I prefer to use it only for T_V_ "
B,Minor,"and um n uh "
B,Task,"not to give too many options "
B,Task,"and and if possible comm uh the buttons should give a dr direct action comm not first select "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"so uh "
B,Task,"and so that's where the difficulties lie . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"you you want to keep it simple comm "
C,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"but I think that if you want to do that comm then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"this "
B,Task,"so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other . "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Elicit,"Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original comm or uh multi-purpose as we thought comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"or do we want to use um many buttons . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Minor,"weighing those factors . "
D,Minor,"Hmm "
D,Task,"it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen um comm "
D,Task,"that in the middle are the the main keys comm "
D,Minor,"like displayed on the "
D,Other,"Uh yeah . "
B,Minor,"The doesn't . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Other,"Yeah comm this ? "
D,Other,"No ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . Something like that . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"just uh in the middle the general functions comm like play comm uh channel switching comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and then uh at the top or at the bottom comm some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but when all the questions I had "
B,Elicit,"Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_ ? "
B,Elicit,"Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ? "
B,Task,"'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ comm you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Uh so "
B,Task,"that's my recommendation comm "
D,Minor,"Nah . "
B,Task,"if you use many options in one buttle button comm um display the menu on the T_V_ "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"is too complicated for most users . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think so too comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus comm "
D,Task,"and when you have a particular menu uh at your device comm uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that will be a problem . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"you d you have to keep in mind that uh several T_V_s uh don't even have a menu structure comm "
C,Task,"or they have a very simple menu structure comm "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Minor,"you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not "
C,Task,"our remote won't be able to work on all televisions . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"And that would be uh a considerable problem . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"if we have to stick with current technologies and uh um well yeah comm the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today comm um you should keep it s at this . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Use big clear buttons . Not too many . "
B,Task,"So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options comm "
B,Task,"but I think i this is more important . Um "
B,Task,"especially the important buttons comm um if you want to switch channel comm change your volume comm uh use teletext comm it uh it has to work at once "
B,Task,"and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote comm behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen . "
C,Minor,"Not embed "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something . "
B,Minor,"And yeah comm "
B,Task,"if you want to uh uh s put on stand-by or change the channel comm that should always be possible to do . "
B,Task,"Not first change menu options or switch something . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um comm well yeah comm "
B,Task,"as you already told comm give some feedback . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . "
B,Minor,"And um comm well comm "
B,Task,"my conclusion is uh is uh less is more comm "
B,Task,"keep it simple . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible "
B,Minor,"on t "
B,Task,"because you all know comm if there are a lot of function on the the television comm "
B,Task,"some you you'll never know "
B,Task,"uh and never use comm "
B,Task,"and therefore it's uh important "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy "
B,Task,"and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them "
B,Task,"or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Uh comm "
D,Task,"I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good . "
D,Task,"Um comm because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people . "
D,Task,"Um comm they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up comm "
D,Task,"um and that's a big ad advantage I think comm "
D,Task,"because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"It's uh "
D,Task,"very visual intended . "
D,Other,"What was I to say more ? "
B,Task,"Maybe that's an option . "
B,Task,"Um keep the primary buttons visible . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands "
B,Task,"and for some design issues uh well comm put a logo on it "
B,Task,"and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form . "
B,Task,"But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear "
B,Task,"and maybe use a touch screen comm "
B,Task,"or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh "
B,Task,"like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . Um "
D,Task,"Yeah okay comm "
D,Task,"but but if you pick the the idea comm the left idea "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ? "
C,Task,"The extra functions . "
B,Task,"The extra functions comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions comm and you just choose one comm "
D,Minor,"but l like menu functions or "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and then all all the options will become available "
D,Other,"Ah okay . "
B,Task,"and you just c s yeah t scroll through them . "
C,Elicit,"Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen comm uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
C,Task,"and uh I'll just make um uh let's say fifteen buttons on it comm "
C,Task,"and uh we have three of those comm uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus comm with or sub-items comm sub-functions . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well um "
B,Other,"then I'd like to make a proposal . "
B,Task,"If you make one big touch screen comm "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"use the same concept as here comm "
B,Task,"keep the buttons always available "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"like like the iPod idea that that we just saw . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus comm "
C,Task,"and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Uh uh I think that will be great . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I wou I would actually go for the "
A,Elicit,"Jirun ? "
B,Task,"Okay comm I agree comm "
B,Task,"but I think it's very important "
B,Task,"that they always um make the same buttons accessible comm "
B,Task,"so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"And so um an elder designer picks up th the of "
B,Task,"an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions comm you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . "
A,Minor,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"like building in uh some kind of PIN code "
D,Task,"uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels comm uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"but children "
D,Task,"uh if children don't don't know the PIN code comm they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"wh "
B,Elicit,"Is that possible to use or no ? "
C,Task,"That is possible comm "
C,Minor,"that "
C,Minor,"well "
D,Minor,"Th there's just "
C,Task,"that actually depends on the television comm "
C,Minor,"but I think I figure that would be "
B,Minor,"Well comm yeah well comm "
B,Elicit,"does it have to depend on the television ? "
D,Task,"Ju just a simple log-in comm something like that . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"y you s you see the fi uh "
C,Task,"thing is when you buy a remote comm you you set the uh channels comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"the the channels are different on each te television comm "
C,Task,"they aren't set in a preset order comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"so uh "
C,Task,"if you uh lock on a remote comm uh let's say channel fifteen comm well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure that um remote control and the T_V_ match comm "
B,Task,"and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords "
B,Task,"as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh change the settings of the T_V_ comm like colour and then volume "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"and uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm th that kind of stuff comm "
D,Task,"but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um comm you address the the channels "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"and like uh oh comm that's channel fifteen comm "
D,Task,"that's uh "
D,Task,"vi violent channel comm "
B,Other,"Oh comm something like that . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"uh m my ki my kids uh "
D,Task,"I don't want my kids to watch that comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"then you set the priority to only parents comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
C,Other,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"b but make it a separate option in the menu comm "
D,Task,"for example . "
C,Minor,"that would b "
D,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that . "
B,Task,"so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh displayed here comm "
D,Task,"Yeah okay comm "
D,Minor,"but but yeah comm that's just "
B,Minor,"so uh "
D,Task,"that's an a an added feature . "
B,Minor,"parents uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"But let's not uh go too wide about the those things comm "
A,Task,"that's that why we're here . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"th th those things are nice . "
A,Task,"It's it's a nice idea comm "
A,Task,"but I think that's we wel later in the stage . "
A,Other,"I've one little question about um a total touch screen "
A,Minor,"or uh um a p "
D,Task,"Partial . "
A,Task,"yeah comm a partial comm "
A,Task,"uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen comm "
A,Task,"so they want the the the normal functions like teletext comm volume changing comm um uh to be uh comm yeah comm kinda traditionals "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"uh and uh the the the the other functions comm the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"but to keep this as uh normal as possible comm to keep it accessible . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"you can de display it on the on the old style . "
D,Task,"that's just as e just as easy . "
C,Minor,"Uh . I I do "
B,Task,"You can display actual buttons on the touch screens . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm that's true comm that's true . "
C,Task,"Uh I do agree comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"because well comm it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen "
C,Task,"or when you touch a button comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it's different . "
C,Task,"W we are aiming for younger people "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's true comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"and they they chose "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"age b below forty . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah yeah comm yeah comm that's a good point . Yep . "
C,Minor,"So that's that's probably uh a "
D,Task,"And th those young people comm yeah . Y you saw it in my marketing report comm they like the new fancy stuff comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"They like the fancy stuff comm yeah . That's true . "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"A touch screen comm like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm Yeah . Okay comm "
D,Task,"I th I think we can do that too . "
A,Task,"as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting comm this one comm are uh are done . "
D,Task,"Done . "
A,Task,"Uh I've uh added the this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think . "
A,Task,"Uh so that can be uh can be read out . "
A,Minor,"Uh a f a few things I uh I noticed uh were um "
A,Task,"Moment . "
A,Other,"Ooh . "
A,Task,"Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look "
A,Minor,"uh with uh "
A,Task,"we must keep it simple comm "
A,Task,"but have the opportunity to uh have more options "
A,Task,"and have them uh hidden or something comm "
A,Task,"so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons "
A,Minor,"or uh um and uh "
A,Task,"the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television comm "
A,Minor,"so you must uh the the the "
A,Task,"the functions comm know comm like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television . "
A,Task,"I think that's the point what uh "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"we discussed . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm some of them . "
D,Task,"The menus uh are not identical for all th for all T_V_s comm "
D,Task,"so you have to display it on one uh T_V_ . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"you can use um when you uh how do you call it comm s um synchronized comm the um remote and the T_V_ comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but that's not possible . "
B,Task,"then there's always comm there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm yeah . "
B,Task,"and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is comm "
B,Minor,"from "
B,Task,"ah comm it's a Philips comm this and this and that comm and then give the options that are capable "
B,Minor,"the capable from the t "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"but you have uh uh an "
D,Minor,"Add th that that's an opportunity . "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"but you have an international market range comm "
A,Task,"so you have I think a big range of "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"there are universal d um um remotes "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s comm "
B,Task,"uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"But they "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"And it's not too complex to do it . "
C,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_ "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and that that is bit of a tricky job . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I actually use one of those "
C,Minor,"when "
C,Task,"They are they are kinda kinda troublesome comm "
C,Task,"but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes comm "
C,Task,"because uh in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_ comm like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Well "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Oh um mo "
C,Minor,"and that's well "
D,Task,"No no no . "
B,Task,"no comm "
B,Minor,"you can just say uh the c "
A,Minor,"Just build it in . "
D,Task,"He he he he me he means just just one other thing . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh comm with the current remote controls comm the universal ones comm um you have to press yeah comm you have to press a code for T_V_ . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"In codes comm y you you get a b a book with codes . "
B,Task,"You look up comm "
B,Task,"I have a Philips H_ fifty five "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and it says press code four five five "
C,Other,"Oh comm okay comm yeah comm sure comm uh "
B,Task,"and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote "
C,Other,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"and it displays all your uh menu options . "
C,Other,"Oh comm yeah yeah comm "
C,Task,"sure comm that would be possible comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Now we uh just connect uh the T_V_ type uh to a set of options comm in just just in the memory comm "
B,Task,"Memory in the in the remote . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Profiles . "
D,Minor,"so that if you "
D,Task,"yeah comm like profile comm "
D,Task,"so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of T_V_ uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"the memory uh pops up the options . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm that would be possible . Yeah comm sure . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I th don't think that's uh that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables . "
C,Task,"No comm that wouldn't be uh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm a few variables . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm well um "
B,Task,"if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes comm there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them comm all the old and new T_V_s summed up comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"so uh "
B,Task,"I think uh it is possible . "
C,Task,"Ah it is . "
C,Minor,"It is definitely po "
D,Task,"But comm on the other hand on the other hand comm uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote "
A,Task,"We have five minutes to go . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well then you have to buy a new one comm "
B,Task,"it's very good for marketing "
D,Other,"New remote ? "
B,Task,"Maybe comm "
B,Task,"or an update comm software update . "
D,Task,"A firmware upgrade or something comm "
B,Other,"Firmware update comm you say . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm firmware upgrade . "
D,Elicit,"but from where ? "
D,Other,"Ah . "
D,Minor,"Maybe w "
C,Task,"That's maybe the cup holder . "
D,Task,"No m may no comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection comm "
D,Task,"so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ "
D,Task,"and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"not everybody has uh has uh a P_C_ at home . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"the most most people have comm "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"but not not everybody "
B,Minor,"at "
B,Task,"uh you can go back to the shop "
C,Minor,"and "
B,Minor,"and uh they "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"like a s kind of service centre . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"ser o "
C,Task,"Yeah comm maybe something like service cen "
B,Task,"and they can download it for you . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Or you could well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier comm "
C,Task,"and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"already digital information is sent t to the the standards comm T_V_ uh connections comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels comm "
B,Task,"so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard T_V_ uh "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in comm "
B,Other,"Receiving . Oh yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"we could actually look at into it comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but I dunno comm "
C,Task,"it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it "
B,Task,"Difficult . "
C,Minor,"and "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I I think it's uh most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that would be probably best comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah comm uh s I think some I think it's good idea comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Like when you when you buy a T_V_ you just ask well I'll "
D,Task,"It's it's it's not a lot of work comm "
D,Task,"just one uh docking station where you put it in comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"press start comm bling bling comm updated . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that would be best comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"You don't buy a T_V_ every week comm new teev so . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"No no . Exactly comm so "
B,Other,"let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh "
B,Elicit,"Um m for which one are we going ? "
B,Other,"My mistake . "
D,Task,"Let's vote . "
B,Elicit,"That one or uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"my vote goes out to the right . "
B,Minor,"Your vote and your "
D,Task,"My vote too . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"And your vote ? "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I was uh doubting about which one to take comm "
B,Task,"but uh you've convinced me "
B,Task,"that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open . "
B,Other,"Opens up "
C,Task,"Flips open . "
B,Task,"is too difficult "
B,Minor,"or uh "
D,Other,"Uh too difficult comm "
D,Task,"um maybe uh it's easier to break it . "
A,Minor,"N yeah . "
B,Other,"Break it comm I don't get "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"th th th that i uh "
A,Task,"It's very sensitive . "
B,Other,"Oh so Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Like my telephone comm it's uh it's sensitive too . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay well uh "
A,Task,"it's almost at the end . "
A,Task,"So we have now a lunch break comm finally comm "
D,Other,"Ah . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work comm once again uh thirty minutes . "
A,Task,"Uh I will put my minutes "
A,Task,"uh I have updated them "
A,Task,"so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too . "
D,Other,"Thirty minutes ? "
A,Task,"Thirty minutes comm "
A,Minor,"the "
D,Other,"How minutes ? "
A,Other,"Failure . "
A,Task,"Uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email . "
A,Other,"I don't think I can uh say much about it comm "
A,Task,"so uh uh wait for your email "
A,Other,"and uh hopefully you get it done uh in the in the thirty minutes comm "
A,Task,"and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes . "
D,Other,"One question comm "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Elicit,"uh how late do we have to get back be back here ? "
A,Minor,"Uh well uh "
A,Task,"thirty minutes . "
B,Elicit,"A quarter to one maybe ? "
A,Task,"Uh comm yeah . "
D,Other,"Thirty minutes lunch break ? "
A,Task,"Thirty minutes lunch break comm yeah . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I thought forty five . "
A,Other,"Oh . Forty five ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh then would it be uh one o'clock . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
A,Task,"Or we we ask our personal coach . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Thank you . Thank you comm uh that was a very uh good session I think comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"we uh we "
B,Elicit,"is it possible to store this on the share documents or what "
D,Other,"Yeah comm me too . "
A,Minor,"Uh ye well "
D,Task,"Save as . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"because uh all uh things are uh stored in smart board dot uh X_D_K_ "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"v "
A,Minor,"and that's in "
D,Task,"But but you can open a from your pr from your laptop . "
B,Minor,"'Kay comm "
B,Task,"save it as an image "
B,Minor,"on the res "
D,Task,"Yeah comm maybe . Save as . "
C,Task,"Export . Maybe not export function . "
D,Other,"No . "
A,Other,"No . "
D,Other,"Export . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"I can I can uh "
D,Other,"Export H_T_M_L_ . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"and use an image if possible . "
D,Other,"Huh comm image ? "
B,Task,"J_ PEG . "
C,Minor,"G_ "
C,Task,"yeah comm J_ PEG . "
B,Task,"J_ PEG . Yeah comm it's better "
D,Other,"Paper size A_ four . Uh screen size . In this directory . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"N oh . "
B,Minor,"Oh yeah comm "
B,Task,"it's not connected to the "
A,Task,"You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work . "
B,Task,"to our P_C_s . "
D,Other,"No ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it is connected . "
B,Other,"It's connected ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
C,Other,"To room . "
A,Other,"Deskt Huh . No . "
C,Task,"I'll just uh saved in my documents . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"in my own uh in my own messenger . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Project documents comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"It gives the na Oh . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Okay comm nice . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"thank you . "
B,Elicit,"The questionnaire comm fill in uh we fill out d after lunch or uh "
A,Minor,"Uh well comm "
A,Task,"it's it's simply filling "
A,Task,"oh no comm "
A,Task,"it's uh it's also filling out "
A,Task,"no comm "
A,Task,"I'd do it after lunch I think . "
B,Task,"Okay . "

A,Task,"so do it after lunch . "
C,Other,"Aye comm cheers . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Other,"Thank you all . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Other,"You're welcome . "
B,Task,"We can leave the P_C_ on I think comm "

B,Minor,"and return to the "
D,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Other,"I bring it to my uh personal room . "
