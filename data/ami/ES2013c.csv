A,Other,"Hi Kate . "
B,Task,"Just just carry on . "
A,Task,"Okay comm carry on . "
A,Minor,"Alright um "
A,Task,"this is the beginning of the third meeting comm the conceptual design meeting . "
A,Task,"Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting comm "
A,Minor,"I have "
A,Task,"the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . "
A,Task,"Um and we should each have a presentation to make . "
A,Task,"Um we have certain decisions to make "
A,Task,"and we have forty minutes total . "
A,Task,"It's twenty five after two at the moment comm "
A,Task,"so forty minutes is five after three comm "
A,Other,"um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um there are the decisions we have to turn to comm "
A,Task,"but we'll come back to them in a minute "
A,Other,"after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . "
A,Minor,"Right um "
A,Task,"as we remember comm I opened the meeting comm "
A,Task,"the four of us were present comm "
A,Task,"the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed "
A,Task,"and approved . "
A,Task,"Um Sarah comm you presented a marketing research report "
A,Task,"um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held comm power comm channel comm volume comm number keys comm possibly a speech recognition . "
A,Task,"And then Steph did a second presentation "
A,Task,"um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . "
A,Task,"I think all of us agreed with those things . "
A,Task,"Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard "
A,Task,"um that it should be a simple mass-produced device comm because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . "
A,Task,"Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries "
A,Task,"and having a docking place as a selling point . "
A,Task,"Um and the new requirements that it for be for T_V_ only "
A,Task,"um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . Um the corporate image . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense comm that were decision makers . "
A,Task,"Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ comm "
A,Task,"but it still should meet those parameters . "
A,Task,"Um and that the function we agreed was volume comm power comm numbers comm enter comm channels comm a way to move between channels comm easy to use and hand-held . "
A,Task,"Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition comm what what do the current ones sell for . "
A,Task,"Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . "
A,Task,"Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . "
A,Task,"And I was to type up these minutes "
A,Task,"and work on the final report . "
A,Elicit,"Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Right . So "
A,Other,"we're ready to close that "
A,Other,"and go back to our That one . "
A,Task,"Right . "
A,Minor,"We're up to the point of the "
A,Other,"Go back . "
A,Task,"Um the three presentations . "
A,Other,"So we're going to pull the plug on me "
A,Task,"and turn to Sarah . "
A,Elicit,"Is that okay ? "
A,Elicit,"Is that alright with everybody else ? "
C,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Especially since Kate asked to be last . "
A,Other,"Sarah comm I'm sorry if I misspelled your name comm "
A,Elicit,"I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or S_A_R_H_ . "
D,Task,"I respond to either . "
D,Other,"No worries . "
A,Other,"You respond to whatever you get comm huh ? "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Um comm did you do your Hit "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Ah comm "
A,Task,"there it is . "
A,Other,"Ta-da . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Other,"first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up comm "
D,Task,"which was uh current cost of the competition devices comm "
D,Task,"similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us "
D,Task,"and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros comm depending on uh branding . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . "
D,Task,"But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for comm we're well within comm even on the lower end comm of the uh of the market . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
D,Other,"But I'm going to move on to more interesting um more vibrant things . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Task,"I investigated the remote control market in greater detail comm "
D,Task,"and my uh the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch . "
D,Minor,"And "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Other,"I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on . "
D,Other,"I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research comm "
D,Minor,"so you know comm "
D,Other,"I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . "
D,Elicit,"What's hot comm "
D,Task,"fruit and veg . Spongy . "
D,Task,"And this is all over the catwalks comm Paris comm Milan comm and I'm talking about clothing comm furniture comm shoes . "
D,Task,"This is really interesting change from past years comm "
D,Task,"because it is much more organic comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"um some would say approachable . "
D,Task,"And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control comm we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . "
D,Minor,"So . "
D,Task,"I also did a little research "
D,Elicit,"on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . "
D,Task,"Fancy . "
D,Task,"Functional is out . "
D,Task,"And f the fancy comm and that's exactly the term comm I'm I'm thinking polished comm elegant comm you know comm kind of innovative comm but a cut above . "
D,Task,"This is twice as important as the next finding comm "
D,Task,"which is technologically innovative . "
D,Task,"This is interesting comm "
D,Task,"'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important comm "
D,Task,"but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh comm you know comm designed in interesting substances . "
D,Task,"Ease of use . Again comm pretty low comm "
D,Task,"I mean it's the top three comm "
D,Task,"but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves . "
B,Task,"I think that's a good idea . "
B,Elicit,"Don't you ? "
D,Minor,"Y yeah comm you know "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote comm you know comm your t your cell phone . "
D,Task,"Exactly . Exactly . "
D,Task,"I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned comm you know comm so comm you know comm something similar to a summer dress . you know comm it would have like fruit and veg comm is that we actually make these spongy . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"They could be ini "
D,Task,"initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held comm so banana comm pineapple and pear . "
D,Task,"Um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development "
D,Task,"and the remote control comm we'd just need to get reductionist on it . "
D,Task,"They could be interchangeable comm "
D,Task,"they're spongy comm "
D,Task,"that goes back to ergonomic comm "
D,Task,"and the youngsters love 'em comm "
D,Task,"fun for the whole family comm everyone can have their own . "
D,Task,"So what we're talking about is changing . this concept . "
D,Task,"Everyone has a T_V_ remote comm "
D,Task,"but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . "
D,Task,"That's what's hot on the catwalks . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Minor,"this is my "
D,Task,"This is what I'm thinking . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh mm . "
A,Elicit,"In most families comm don't isn't the remote is a remote . "
D,Task,"Y yeah comm "
D,Minor,"but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it "
D,Task,"we all need a remote comm "
D,Task,"but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising comm I'm thinking the teenager comm the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So when your dad's sitting there comm overriding your decision comm going no we're gonna watch this comm you can bring out your own remote and be like zap comm no we're gonna watch this . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"W and plus I think "
A,Minor,"Mm . Well "
A,Task,"actually some households do have three and four T_V_s "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and they would have a remote for each one comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . So "
D,Task,"this is an idea "
D,Minor,"and I I "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Task,"this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . "
D,Elicit,"So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This spongy fruit and veg . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
B,Task,"I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . "
D,Other,"Alright . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Spongy is gonna be difficult comm I'm afraid . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"And as for as for um well budgeting as well comm if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components . "
D,Task,"I I just have my ear to the market comm guys . "
C,Other,"Is this to the market ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm I mean basically "
B,Task,"we can make these things out of wood comm titanium comm plastic or rubber . "
B,Task,"I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy comm "
D,Task,"Is spongiest comm yeah . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"That would add "
B,Task,"I was thinking titanium myself . "
C,Task,"I was thinking titanium comm "
C,Minor,"I was thinking it's just "
C,Task,"I have been influenced by pictures of iPods comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and they're also minimalist and shiny . "
D,Task,"They are "
D,Task,"and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority comm "
D,Task,"which is fancy . "
D,Task,"I think many of us would associate those with fancy . "
D,Task,"Something else we could do is uh call it something that's fruit and veg oriented . "
D,Task,"We could call it uh The name . "
A,Elicit,"Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ? "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"it would be uh a a very simple product "
D,Task,"that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So "
A,Task,"Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but it's kind of pointless comm "
C,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
A,Task,"and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"That comm you know comm that might be "
C,Task,"Let's delegate . "
A,Elicit,"Wo would that be agreeable ? "
D,Task,"And then we could keep it titanium . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit comm "
B,Task,"because I think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm maybe . "
C,Minor,"Or "
A,Elicit,"Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ? "
C,Task,"I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"we'll move the "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"You can even have them in different flavours as well . "
C,Task,"So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote comm it could be like pear flavour comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Or s or smelly . Scratchy "
C,Task,"yeah . Scratch and sniff . "
D,Minor,"Uh well "
D,Task,"I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone . "
D,Task,"It's hot on the streets comm guys . "
B,Minor,"Right comm well "
B,Minor,"I I I think some of this um "
B,Task,"you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you comm "
B,Task,"but I'm afraid this is the real world . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate comm "
B,Task,"and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division comm "
B,Task,"who have told me what's actually available comm you know comm what the current state of the art in components is comm and some of the exciting new things they've got comm "
B,Task,"but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want "
B,Minor,"um . Now "
B,Task,"this isn't a very good overhead comm "
B,Task,"but this is just to show you comm "
B,Task,"this is the innards of a remote control um . "
B,Task,"I really need a pen or something "
B,Minor,"but uh "
B,Elicit,"does my mouse work ? "
B,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"Um oh "
B,Task,"yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"can you see my little mouse pointer ? "
A,Task,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"This is this is the a a a remote that's been opened up "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"and that's the the back of the interface . "
B,Task,"And this is a push-button one comm "
B,Task,"so you see these little little buttons here comm they're little rubber rubber buttons "
B,Task,"that go through onto the the board at the back "
B,Task,"and they push these buttons here . "
B,Minor,"Um and we "
B,Task,"that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . "
B,Task,"We got to have something that pushes the little buttons "
B,Task,"that um talk to the chip "
B,Task,"that encodes the message "
B,Task,"that sends the the message to the receiver . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Other,"I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made comm Sarah comm "
B,Other,"but um doing my presentation in the order I wrote it . "
B,Other,"So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . "
B,Task,"Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment . "
B,Task,"We can have a hand "
B,Other,"sorry "
C,Other,"A wind-up . "
B,Task,"a wind-up comm yeah comm "
B,Task,"which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control comm "
B,Task,"but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . "
B,Task,"Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source comm "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Remember comm "
A,Task,"we only have forty minutes "
B,Task,"where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"You have to "
B,Task,"it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work comm "
B,Task,"but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then comm "
B,Task,"it'll work . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Or we we had talked about solar power comm "
B,Task,"but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Now "
B,Task,"I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . "
B,Task,"It can be made of plastic comm rubber comm wood o if you like comm or titanium . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber comm "
B,Other,"but um I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium comm "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"and basically it can have a flat surface comm a curved surface or a double curved surface comm "
B,Task,"but I think if we wanna use standard components comm we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"what does the interface look like ? "
B,Minor,"Um well "
B,Task,"push button comm that's that's the one we're all familiar with . "
B,Task,"Um we can have scroll buttons "
B,Task,"and the the scroll button can incorporate a push comm "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"so you can have it like on a mouse "
B,Task,"where you can use it to go up and down comm change volume or channel or something like that "
B,Task,"and push to select something . "
B,Task,"Um you can have multiple scroll buttons comm "
B,Task,"um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated comm "
B,Task,"but um it's it the technology is there . "
B,Task,"And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote comm "
B,Task,"but this will increase the cost . "
B,Task,"Um the electronics that actually makes the device work comm we've basically got three comm simple comm regular comm advanced comm "
B,Task,"and the price goes up as we choose each of this . "
B,Task,"If we want the nice cheap one comm the simple comm then we can only have push buttons . "
B,Task,"All the other fancy interface designs go out the window comm I'm afraid . "
B,Task,"Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . "
B,Task,"If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more comm "
B,Task,"but it that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display . "
B,Task,"And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . "
B,Minor,"Now "
B,Task,"I don't know what that is comm "
B,Task,"but I think they think it's quite important "
B,Task,"and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . "
B,Task,"Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons comm I have to say comm "
B,Task,"but maybe you think that's old technology . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"And well "
B,Task,"I I think we've got two options . "
B,Task,"We can either go for a really cheap model comm "
B,Task,"keep all of the costs down comm "
B,Task,"um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . "
B,Task,"Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer comm "
B,Task,"I think it comm um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple comm "
B,Task,"but um that may or may not be a good thing . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Task,"Um but it could have an L_C_D_ screen "
B,Task,"and it could have multiple scroll buttons comm "
B,Task,"and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Other,"thank you . "
D,Task,"That sounds good . "
D,Minor,"Any idea you "
D,Task,"you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . "
D,Elicit,"Um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I'm afraid I don't have that information available . "
B,Task,"Um manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this comm I'm afraid . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Because comm you know what comm I'm being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot . "
D,Task,"But I think the important thing might be to choose one . "
D,Task,"You know comm if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible comm maybe we could something about naming comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"we could call it comm you know comm Blackberry . "
D,Minor,"That's uh "
C,Task,"Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company comm "
C,Task,"so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . "
B,Elicit,"Banana ? "
D,Other,"Alright comm "
D,Minor,"well "
D,Task,"let's see then . "
C,Minor,"But um "
C,Task,"I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future comm fruit-wise . "
D,Minor,"But yeah comm "
D,Other,"I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit . "
B,Task,"We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one comm "
B,Task,"which would allow um say a banana comm "
B,Task,"but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that comm we have to have a push button as the interface comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"we can't do anything fancier . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Elicit,"Shall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what well comm my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
D,Other,"Thank you comm Kate . "
A,Other,"Thank you comm Kate . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . "
C,Task,"So so mine's a bit pointless . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
C,Elicit,"F_N_ and F_ eight comm did you say ? "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"There we go . "
C,Task,"I don't have it on mine though . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Minor,"I think um Florence resolved it by "
B,Task,"I If you do F_ uh F_N_ F_ eight again comm it's it'll "
D,Task,"F_ eight again . "
A,Task,"Do it again . "
A,Task,"Keep doing it until you get it in both "
A,Task,"you get it there comm "
B,Minor,"I think it yeah comm you you will do an "
A,Task,"you get it yours without that one comm "
A,Task,"and then you get it with both . "
C,Elicit,"Should I do it again ? "
D,Task,"Maybe . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"This time it should come up both . "
C,Minor,"Right then . "
C,Task,"I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"just that my method was to look at the comm well comm my my inspirations comm "
C,Task,"which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing comm including M_P_ three players comm uh like you know comm hi-fi remotes comm not just television and these things . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones comm "
C,Task,"um what functions we actually need comm "
C,Task,"and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . "
C,Task,"Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel comm "
C,Minor,"which "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Minor,"I couldn't find a "
C,Task,"the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser comm "
C,Task,"so I couldn't copy and paste it comm "
C,Task,"but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . "
C,Task,"It has uh scroll wheels without without a display comm "
C,Task,"but they they scroll like a computer mouse . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"So I was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . "
C,Task,"Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does . "
C,Minor,"Like comm you know comm "
C,Task,"you press enter "
C,Task,"and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment comm "
C,Minor,"and you can do "
C,Task,"you can scroll along "
C,Task,"and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour comm "
C,Task,"and you scroll up "
C,Task,"and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . "
C,Task,"Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice comm big comm easy buttons to press comm "
C,Task,"but still quite simple and quite cost effective . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple comm uh not fancy but not totally minimalist comm I mean just pretty simple plastic comm probably comm "
C,Task,"I was thinking comm yellow and black comm "
C,Task,"just because that's the company's colours comm "
C,Task,"with very very few buttons comm but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen comm like comm you know comm just small along the bottom "
C,Task,"instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes comm which is far too expensive . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you comm you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And so on that you can comm just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote comm scroll along comm scroll up and down . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I'd I'd certainly support that idea . "
C,Task,"And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . "
C,Task,"I mean titanium would be great comm "
C,Task,"but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . "
C,Task,"If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic comm then I think titanium's too futuristic . "
B,Task,"It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well comm "
B,Task,"we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Uh then "
B,Task,"And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea comm "
B,Task,"'cause um otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting building the L_C_D_ in comm but for the electronics as well . "
C,Task,"And it's a little bit pointless as well I think . "
D,Task,"It's a duplication . "
C,Minor,"Like "
B,Task,"There is that . "
C,Task,"when when when you've got when you've got the screen there comm it doesn't have to be anything fancy comm "
C,Minor,"just a little menu showing "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"a menu comm you go into one menu "
C,Task,"and then it can have your different options comm whether you wanna change the settings or the you know comm your information about programme that's on at the moment . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"I don't think that's to taxing to uh s engineer . Um . "
C,Other,"But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . "
C,Task,"And I quite like it comm "
C,Task,"'cause it's just smooth and hand-held "
C,Task,"and it's got these easily reachable buttons "
C,Task,"that quite nicely uh spaced out comm "
C,Task,"so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . Up comm down comm left comm right . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? "
C,Task,"I I was thinking not actually scroll comm like a like mouse scroll comm "
C,Minor,"but you know comm a "
C,Task,"I can't quite d uh describe it . "
C,Task,"you see on the one on the right comm down at the bottom comm is the mouse . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"see where the mouse is comm "
C,Task,"like this s style thing where you c have up comm down comm left and right . And enter in the middle comm "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"Right . "
C,Task,"so you pick your menu and then your different options "
C,Task,"and when when you click on each one comm it you can go into a new menu for that . "
C,Task,"I'm getting a bit uh specific here . "
C,Task,"Really we'd have to use something to show you comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think I think that's a g nice clean design comm "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"it's playing to our strengths "
B,Task,"which are in push button technology . "
D,Minor,"To uh m make it . "
C,Minor,"If "
C,Task,"I don't think I can get it up on the screen . "
C,Task,"Ah here we go . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"nice . "
D,Minor,"Um Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"the iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Task,"It does scroll comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but it is hugely complicated . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"What else have we got ? "
D,Task,"Wow . "
C,Task,"Them comm they're terrible . "
C,Task,"But they all have this this feature of this uh It's not quite a scroll wheel comm but it's a kind of selection in this circle comm "
A,Task,"It's a selection wheel . "
C,Task,"which I think is a really good idea . "
B,Task,"But we can implement it with simple push buttons comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"which is much cheaper . "
C,Task,"like up comm down comm left and right . "
C,Task,"Which is good . "
C,Minor,"And then and then "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm so I mean "
C,Task,"either a channel up and down comm volume up and down comm next appearing programmes up and down comm uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen comm it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And that's it . "
B,Minor,"In fact "
C,Task,"Look at look at this one . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Task,"that's really nice . "
C,Other,"Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . "
D,Minor,"Do you think with um "
C,Other,"Might take up your whole living room . "
D,Task,"It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic comm "
D,Task,"perhaps the something reminiscent of the child's remote . "
D,Elicit,"Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract . "
D,Minor,"You know comm "
D,Task,"we could call like a fruit name comm "
C,Task,"Possibly . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"but it would be a little more abstract . "
B,Task,"Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy "
C,Task,"That also is possible . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I'm just just throwing out ideas . "
C,Minor,"Just "
A,Task,"Or call it a or call it a banana "
A,Task,"and have it in yellow . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention "
C,Elicit,"is have you have you seen these on a remote ? "
C,Task,"This is actually the volume up and down comm "
C,Task,"but they both say V_ on them comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"which comm when you first look at it comm you expect that to be the down comm "
C,Task,"because it looks like a downward pointing arrow comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume comm "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Nice . Good point . "
C,Task,"But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . "
C,Task,"If we're having the scroll wheel comm then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Task,"But then comm that's complicated . "
A,Other,"I wanna thank you all for all your presentations . "
A,Task,"We have about ten minutes left comm "
A,Task,"in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . "
A,Task,"Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . "
A,Task,"Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components comm um the materials comm things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"let's "
A,Minor,"Mm . Right . "
A,Task,"They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use comm "
A,Task,"which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery comm kinetic or solar . "
A,Task,"Um this is where Kate's expertise comes in comm "
A,Task,"and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point . "
A,Minor,"The "
A,Task,"You were saying that the kinetic would be useful comm "
A,Task,"that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it "
A,Task,"um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um "
A,Task,"or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day comm that it'll die on you comm and no way to do it . "
A,Task,"That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"Um so what's our pleasure here comm what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ? "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Task,"unfortunately I don't have costing information . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I i in terms of workability comm I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic comm "
B,Other,"but I'm sorry "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
B,Task,"I don't figures on the difference in cost . "
A,Elicit,"What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ? "
D,Task,"I've used kinetic in terms of watches "
D,Task,"and it's very very uh handy comm "
D,Task,"you don't even notice um that it's there . "
C,Task,"It sounds great . "
C,Task,"I've never come across it before comm "
C,Task,"but it sounds fantastic . "
C,Task,"Sounds like it could be g a really good economical "
D,Minor,"It's "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"it would make the whole thing a lot lighter comm more convenient . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"It could tie in with the fanciful design "
D,Minor,"as "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"uh comm you know comm "
C,Task,"'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought comm "
D,Task,"throw the banana comm you know comm just gotta keep it moving . "
C,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
C,Minor,"It's like "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"a good selling point . "
A,Task,"So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible . "
D,Minor,"Be "
C,Task,"But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . "
A,Task,"It costs . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
B,Task,"And and how much you do have to keep it moving comm "
A,Task,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"But I could market that as a um as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road comm in terms of battery comm you know . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"True comm yeah comm "
B,Task,"m more more environmentally friendly . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's what I was thinking as well . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . You know comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"kind of the "
A,Other,"Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish comm thanks . "
A,Task,"Um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision . "
B,Minor,"Oh right comm okay comm "
B,Minor,"I'd "
B,Other,"that that's something I maybe should have covered . "
B,Task,"Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique "
A,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"um and I would certainly recommend it comm I think comm "
B,Task,"because I'm not sure I have an alternative . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built "
A,Minor,"What about the ca "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Minor,"the way we "
A,Minor,"uh-huh . "
B,Task,"and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper . "
A,Other,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Elicit,"Um what about the case ? "
A,Task,"I think they're talking there about do we want wood comm plastic comm titanium or rubber comm "
A,Task,"and I think we've discussed not having titanium . "
A,Task,"One comm it's too expensive comm "
A,Task,"um and second comm it won't do this double um curves . "
A,Task,"Um we've sort of eliminated wood . "
A,Task,"We said plastic or rubber . "
A,Elicit,"What's the pleasure ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel comm "
B,Task,"the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls comm "
D,Task,"That's exactly what I was thinking . I'm sold . "
B,Minor,"so it's "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"What about you ? "
C,Elicit,"Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside comm and then a kind of spongy Yeah comm s thick spongy cover comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"Kind of like an internal egg . "
A,Task,"Cover . "
C,Task,"so it feels like the whole thing's spongy comm "
C,Task,"but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it . "
A,Other,"Plastic inside . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible comm "
B,Task,"but I agree comm it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile comm "
C,Task,"you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them comm "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"And with sports on television . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"and "
D,Minor,"You know . "
A,Task,"Um the next part they want is the user interface concept . "
D,Minor,"I su "
B,Minor,"I should I should r "
A,Other,"I'm sorry to push you comm "
A,Task,"but we only have a couple minutes to finish with . "
D,Task,"Then I'll just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"and it says interface . What type and what supplements ? "
C,Task,"Just copy the one on the left . "
C,Task,"No "
C,Minor,"um a scroll "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"like four buttons comm up comm down comm left and right with enter in the middle comm that will correspond to a menu on the screen . "
B,Task,"Which I think technically is just push button "
B,Task,"and uh I'd certainly support that that "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I'd like push buttons with "
B,Task,"that brings the cost down quite a lot "
B,Task,"and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"push buttons "
A,Minor,"Okay comm um "
A,Task,"that's that . "
A,Task,"Um this is gonna sound weird comm "
A,Task,"but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . "
A,Other,"Whew . "
A,Task,"And they actually want a look and feel design comm user interface design comm "
A,Task,"you can look and see this as well as I can . "
A,Task,"Marketing they want product evaluation . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually . "
D,Task,"No we can't comm actually . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Other,"Oh my comm I'm sorry . "
D,Task,"That's why I was looking over your shoulder "
A,Other,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Other,"Sorry about that . "
A,Task,"missed that one . "
A,Other,"This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . "
A,Other,"Ah comm ta-da . "
C,Task,"Now it's gone again . "
A,Other,"Ah . "
B,Minor,"You know comm "
B,Task,"I think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately . "
A,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Task,"because I can't even see mine . "
A,Task,"Next meeting starts in thirty minutes comm "
C,Task,"Oh yes . "
A,Task,"these are the individual actions . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm right . "
A,Task,"Um the look and feel design is for Kate comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"uh Steph gets the user interface design comm "
A,Task,"you get product evaluation . "
A,Task,"Um the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . "
C,Task,"Great . "
A,Task,"Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . "
D,Task,"Sounds good . "
A,Elicit,"Anything else we need to do ? "
C,Task,"I don't think so . "
A,Task,"Go to it . "
C,Other,"Play-Doh . "
A,Task,"And that's the end of this meeting . "
A,Task,"That's for her benefit . "
D,Other,"That's really all I got comm guys . "
