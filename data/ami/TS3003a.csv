A,Minor,"So uh "
A,Other,"good morning . "
B,Other,"Morning . "
D,Other,"Morning . "
C,Other,"Morning . "
A,Task,"I see you all find your places . "
A,Elicit,"Is everybody sitting on the right place ? Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"I guess so . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Let's see . "
A,Other,"First I will introduce myself . "
A,Task,"I don't know if uh if everybody knows me comm "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"I'm Bart comm "
D,Task,"My name's Frank . "
A,Other,"hello . Hello . "
B,Task,"I'm . "
A,Task,"Bart . "
A,Other,"Hello . "
A,Other,"Hello . "
A,Task,"Bart . "
A,Other,"Welcome . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"Uh let's see . Uh "
A,Other,"let's start off um with a little presentation . "
A,Other,"Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting . "
A,Task,"You can see there are a few cameras here . "
A,Task,"They'll record uh our actions "
A,Task,"and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . "
A,Task,"Uh there are also some microphones there "
A,Task,"but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those comm "
A,Task,"because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"is there a project documents folder ? "
A,Task,"There are some notes in it already I see comm some documents . "
A,Other,"Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off . "
A,Task,"Is being modified by the administrator . "
A,Other,"Uh okay . "
D,Task,"Hmm comm that's interesting . "
A,Other,"Let's do it read only . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I don't know if you've noticed comm but uh we're working for Real Reaction . "
A,Task,"Uh it's a company in uh electronics . "
A,Task,"We put fashion in electronics comm "
A,Task,"uh we make it work comm "
A,Task,"uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . "
A,Task,"I'm Bart the project manager "
A,Task,"so I'll direct you through the project . "
A,Task,"This is our agenda . "
A,Task,"Uh we have our opening acquaintance comm tool training comm project plan description closing . "
A,Other,"Uh maybe I can sit down comm "
A,Other,"then I can take some notes "
A,Minor,"or "
A,Minor,"Let's see . "
A,Task,"Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . "
D,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"I dunno it's not a lot of work comm "
A,Task,"but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down comm just write it down . "
A,Task,"Uh as you can see uh it's the opening comm aquaintance tool training . "
A,Task,"Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . "
A,Elicit,"Um have you all seen the corporate website already ? "
D,Task,"Yep . Visit it . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Have you seen any flaws in it ? "
A,Task,"I think I found one . "
A,Elicit,"No ? "
B,Elicit,"Hmm ? "
D,Task,"Can't say I paid much attention to it comm "
A,Other,"I can see if it works this way . "
A,Task,"No comm it doesn't work here . "
A,Task,"Okay no problem . "
A,Task,"But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction . "
D,Other,"Oh yeah . "
A,Task,"Real Remote is not really the company we're we are comm "
A,Task,"but it's just a little fault . "
B,Other,"Okay . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"what are we going to do ? "
A,Task,"Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . "
A,Task,"It has to be original comm trendy comm and user friendly . "
A,Task,"So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . "
A,Task,"We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original . "
A,Task,"And we've got our User Interface Designer . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"He's also uh "
A,Task,"That's about the new remote control . "
A,Task,"Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . "
A,Task,"First is functional des uh design comm individual work comm meetings . "
A,Task,"After the functional design comm then the conceptual design and the detailed design . "
A,Task,"I had some role indications on here . "
A,Task,"But I think you know it already by yourself . "
A,Task,"The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design comm uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . "
A,Task,"Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design comm user interface concept and user interface design . "
A,Task,"And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification comm trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation . "
A,Task,"So that's a bit what you're going to do . "
A,Task,"But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings . "
A,Task,"Then we've got our first tool training . "
A,Task,"We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here comm "
A,Task,"so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . "
A,Task,"As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . "
A,Task,"Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . "
A,Task,"Here are some functions . "
A,Task,"You can save . "
A,Minor,"N "
A,Task,"uh these functions we don't have anything to do with comm "
A,Task,"only undo comm you can undo a little uh piece of drawing . "
A,Task,"A blank new document for each person . "
A,Task,"Uh select a pen comm "
A,Task,"eraser . "
A,Task,"Capture we don't have to do anything with . "
A,Task,"Uh then we've got our pen . This pen . "
A,Task,"It's really funny "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of . "
A,Task,"You can also select the current colour and the line width . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"But then first you have to select the pen function . "
A,Task,"But we're going to work with it in a minute . "
A,Minor,"So okay . Uh "
A,Task,"that's very simple "
A,Task,"and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there . "
A,Other,"Uh then a short thing about documents . "
A,Task,"We've got our shared folder comm "
A,Minor,"project project "
A,Elicit,"what was it ? "
A,Task,"Project documents I think . "
A,Task,"But all you will found that already "
A,Task,"because there are a lot of documents in it already comm "
A,Other,"so it will be okay . "
A,Task,"And these are available on the smart boards as well comm "
A,Task,"so if you have a document you wanna show comm just open it from the folder . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Here is a simple tool bar . "
A,Task,"It's what I just said comm "
A,Task,"it's save comm print comm move back or forward one page . "
A,Task,"You can switch between the different drawings . "
A,Task,"And then we're going to try out the white board . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"as you can see we g all going to draw a animal . Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it . "
A,Task,"Mouse wasn't running away . "
D,Task,"That was interesting . "
A,Elicit,"Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ? "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Innocent . "
A,Task,"We're going to uh draw animal . "
A,Task,"And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . "
A,Task,"Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours comm and different line width . "
A,Minor,"Uh there's "
A,Other,"I can start from now . I will . "
A,Task,"You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . "
A,Task,"Because if you hold it like this comm the sensors will get blocked "
A,Task,"and then the drawing won't get good . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . "
A,Task,"'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"we choose form of current colour "
A,Task,"uh I think grey is appropriate . "
A,Other,"Then the line width . "
A,Task,"I think seven will be nice . "
A,Task,"Now you'll see my drawing capabilities . "
A,Other,"These are not very much comm "
A,Minor,"but uh "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm see "
A,Task,"you have to do it real slow . "
A,Other,"Oh "
B,Minor,"Sure . "
A,Other,"Ah "
A,Task,"I was trying to draw a dolphin comm "
A,Task,"but I think his nose has to be a little bit "
A,Task,"But it's close . "
D,Task,"I'm thinking about a swordfish . "
A,Minor,"So what "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"he hasn't got an eye . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Woah . "
A,Other,"Now we've got another function . "
A,Other,"We've got the eraser . "
A,Task,"And then you can undo "
A,Task,"this easily . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Other,"Meat . "
A,Task,"Ah it's okay . "
A,Task,"And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics . "
A,Minor,"Uh is "
A,Task,"They've got no text tool comm no . Uh . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"This is typically a undo action comm I think . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Pen . "
A,Task,"Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . "
A,Task,"I think that's it "
A,Task,"because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . "
A,Task,"But I don't know comm "
A,Task,"I'm just trying . "
A,Task,"This is not my work comm "
A,Minor,"okay . "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Maybe you have to use "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Uh . I think it's a "
A,Other,"it wants to draw a another animal ? "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"It lives for the fun . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin . It lives for the fun . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . "
A,Task,"Go ahead . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Gonna use a different line width . "
D,Other,"And I'm gonna draw in black . "
D,Task,"There . "
D,Minor,"'Kay comm "
D,Other,"I'm not much of an artist comm "
D,Other,"but here we go . "
A,Task,"Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width comm I think . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Because this is going a lot better than uh I did . "
B,Task,"A sheep . "
D,Other,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"This is my um Hmm . "
D,Task,"Sheep . "
A,Task,"It's nice . "
D,Task,"With of course "
D,Task,"little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts . "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Other,"It's a real dead sheep comm "
D,Task,"There . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"For recognition comm "
A,Other,"yeah comm I see . "
A,Task,"Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere . "
D,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"On just a "
D,Minor,"They are "
D,Other,"Come on . "
D,Task,"You have to go really slow when you're writing . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"They're brilliant animal animals . "
D,Task,"And that's just a little me thingy . "
D,Minor,"So . "
D,Other,"Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Nice . "
B,Other,"Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head comm "
B,Minor,"but mm "
B,Minor,"Let's see . "
B,Other,"Mm . Uh . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Interesting . "
A,Task,"Sweet . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"You know what that is ? "
B,Elicit,"Or who ? "
D,Elicit,"A rabbit ? "
C,Task,"Garfield . "
B,Task,"Ah okay comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Garfield . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Just a "
B,Other,"Mm . Guess . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"Yeah . That's enough . "
B,Elicit,"Um comm you say a blank comm "
B,Minor,"or "
A,Task,"Yeah comm just a blank sheet . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I was gonna draw a cat too comm "
C,Minor,"so . "
C,Other,"I'll just try something else . "
A,Other,"No . "
C,Other,"Something different than Garfield . "
C,Task,"Mine is a bit more skinny . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"it's pretty skinny cat . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"But uh "
D,Task,"And the most interesting tail . "
A,Elicit,"Is your cat comm "
A,Elicit,"or did you find him on the street ? "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"it's supposed to be a cat . "
C,Task,"I like cats "
C,Task,"because uh they are uh independent . "
A,Other,"Ah . "
C,Other,"The pen . "
C,Minor,"So . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"That's pretty clear . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board comm just ask "
C,Other,"The pen . "
A,Task,"and go ahead . "
A,Task,"It's pretty uh easy . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"S "
D,Other,"We're being haunted . "
A,Other,"haunted white board . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we've got the tool uh introduction . "
A,Task,"We "
A,Task,"move along to the project finance . "
A,Task,"Um as you can see comm we um for our remote control comm a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price . "
A,Task,"Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros . "
A,Task,"Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls comm "
A,Task,"so we have to work together to reach our aims . "
A,Task,"Uh we can do it international comm "
A,Task,"so we have to focus on different kind of users comm different kind of cultures comm and different kind of trends as well . "
A,Task,"Um but that's all in the later stadium . "
A,Task,"Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros comm "
A,Task,"so that's also a point we have to keep in mind comm "
A,Task,"that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside comm and stuff like that . "
A,Task,"It won't work . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five comm profit aims fifty million um comm but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"that's leads us to our little discussion . "
A,Task,"We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"I'm gonna sit down comm I think . "
A,Task,"It's easier . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"you got a message . "
A,Other,"I've got a message . "
A,Task,"Five minutes . "
B,Other,"Five minutes comm okay . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"that's uh good timing . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"just on a side note comm why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ? "
B,Minor,"Mm ? "
A,Task,"Uh maybe you have to say the magic word . "
D,Other,"Yeah . Right . "
A,Elicit,"Does it do anything ? "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Maybe you have to just clap it down ? Mm back up again . "
A,Task,"No slide show . Hmm . "
D,Task,"It's off now . "
A,Other,"It's off . "
A,Task,"Now you have to put it back o "
A,Task,"Oh yeah . "
A,Task,"You'll be okay comm I think . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"it was on comm "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"it's those laptops . "
D,Minor,"Ah comm "
D,Task,"there we are . "
A,Other,"Nice . "
A,Minor,"Okay . But so mm "
A,Elicit,"does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls comm and I mean not the ordinary mote controls comm but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Oh really ? "
A,Elicit,"No ? "
B,Task,"Huh . "
A,Elicit,"You ? "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"we have a "
C,Task,"No comm me neither . "
B,Minor,"It's a "
D,Task,"kind of broad T_V_ at home comm and a D_V_D_ player comm "
D,Task,"so we got like a lot of remote controls comm one for the T_V_ comm one for the video recorder comm one for the D_V_D_ player . "
A,Minor,"Ah yeah . "
D,Task,"And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . "
A,Minor,"Yep . Yeah "
B,Task,"Sure . Yeah . "
A,Task,"I've I've got one at home . "
A,Task,"And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it comm "
A,Task,"and you can use it for your television comm anything else . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"And it also operates on infra-red comm "
A,Task,"so you have to got the little device inside your room comm "
A,Task,"and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Elicit,"really . "
A,Task,"So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor . So that's a pretty handy um "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"thing . "
A,Minor,"Um but only the "
A,Task,"I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control comm it makes it a lot easier as well . "
A,Minor,"It's uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"That's good to remember . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"I think you can take minutes again . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"that's nice comm I think . "
D,Task,"Since it's your job . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we've we want different functions "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . "
A,Task,"But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs . "
A,Task,"So that uh that's something we have to find out comm I think . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But that would be really good if we could do that . "
A,Elicit,"And other functions for a remote control ? "
A,Minor,"Maybe we can make it uh uh "
D,Minor,"Um . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Think it has to be shock proof "
B,Task,"Sure comm yeah . "
D,Task,"'cause "
A,Other,"Shock proof . "
D,Task,"my remote control tends to fall a lot . "
B,Task,"Waterproof comm "
B,Minor,"or uh "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Uh comm you never no know uh comm "
A,Task,"Sure . "
B,Minor,"I w I mean uh "
A,Other,"Waterproof . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
A,Task,"these are our um a few things we can think of . "
A,Other,"Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"one other little thing . "
D,Task,"Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it . "
D,Task,"So you can see "
A,Minor,"That's a "
A,Other,"battery stays . "
B,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
D,Task,"how much is left in the battery . "
D,Task,"But they'll also really drag up the production costs comm "
D,Task,"so think we'll have to see about that too . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Uh . "
D,Task,"But maybe just a little LED comm "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"That's an idea as well . "
A,Elicit,"Other ideas ? Quick ideas . "
C,Task,"Nope . "
C,Task,"They were all mentioned comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"so "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Any questions about this uh presentation ? Kick off presentation . "
D,Task,"Um . Nope comm don't think so . "
A,Elicit,"No ? "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder comm "
A,Task,"and then we can all work . "
A,Task,"Finish meeting now . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And we can all work uh on our own projects . "
D,Other,"Aye sir . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,"then I'll meet you in about a half an hour comm I think . "
D,Task,"Half an hour . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"So good luck . "
B,Other,"Yep . "
