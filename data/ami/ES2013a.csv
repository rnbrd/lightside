A,Minor,"Okay . So . Right . "
A,Elicit,"You ready back there ? "
A,Minor,"Uh okay . "
A,Other,"Welcome everyone . "
A,Task,"Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day . "
A,Task,"Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction . "

A,Task,"um become acquainted with each other comm "
A,Task,"um have a little training on tools comm "
A,Task,"uh create a plan comm "
A,Task,"discuss things "
A,Task,"and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"The new remote control is to be original comm trendy and user-friendly . "
A,Task,"That comm Steph comm is your part comm is the user-friendliness . "
A,Task,"The originality um is gonna take all of us . "
A,Task,"Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you comm Sarah . "
A,Task,"Um and we'll get on with it . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . "
A,Task,"Kate comm why don't you try it first comm if you can either bring your things with you comm I guess "
B,Task,"Uh yeah comm if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces comm "
B,Task,"hang on . "
A,Task,"And while you're doing that "
A,Other,"we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well comm "
A,Task,"'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around . "
B,Minor,"Uh right comm so "
B,Elicit,"you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . "
B,Elicit,"Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? Um "
A,Task,"Uh I do not think so comm "
A,Task,"I think it's just to try out the whiteboard . "
C,Elicit,"Are we all gonna draw a cat ? "
D,Task,"I know . "
B,Task,"Only animal I could thin I could draw . "
A,Other,"Ah . "
B,Task,"Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . "
B,Task,"You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well comm sort of "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Right comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Great . "
A,Elicit,"And the characteristics ? "
B,Task,"Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers I think comm um "
B,Task,"because they're the easiest to draw . "
A,Other,"Uh-huh . "
B,Other,"In fact comm I'll give it some more "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"and the tail "
A,Other,"Fantastic . "
A,Task,"Since you're handy as well comm "
A,Task,"why don't you do yours next comm Steph . "
A,Task,"I think it's to get us used to using the pen . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Um sure it's not to test our artistic "
A,Other,"Uh no . "
B,Task,"It's a mouse . "
A,Elicit,"A mouse-y ? "
C,Task,"That's not a mouse-y comm no . "
B,Other,"No it's not a mouse . "
B,Task,"It's a wombat . "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Task,"It's a ratty . "
A,Other,"Argh . "
B,Other,"A what ? "
C,Task,"A ratty . "
A,Task,"Rat . "
A,Task,"Not a mouse comm a rat . "
B,Task,"A webbed foot . "
B,Minor,"Webbed f "
C,Task,"It's clothes . That's it's clothes . "
B,Other,"Oh right . "
C,Task,"It's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail . "
A,Task,"And your favourite characteristics of that animal . "
C,Task,"I love whiskers . "
C,Task,"Uh they're intelligent "
C,Task,"and they're cheeky "
C,Task,"and uh fantastic pets "
C,Task,"and very friendly . "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And they sit on your shoulder "
A,Task,"Kate ? "
C,Task,"and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Task,"a fish . "
C,Elicit,"A shark ? "
B,Other,"Gosh comm "
B,Task,"why didn't I think of fish ? "
B,Task,"That's even easier to draw than cat . "
D,Task,"Mm this is very representational fish . "
A,Other,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Other,"Fine . "
D,Task,"Um I like them because they're sleek "
A,Elicit,"Favourite characteristics ? "
D,Task,"and they have a lot of freedom "
D,Task,"but they also do n uh swim in groups comm "
D,Minor,"so . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"Do you have a favourite one ? "
A,Task,"they have team elements . "
A,Task,"I'm afraid I'm with Steph . "
A,Task,"And I think your pen's running out of whatever . "
A,Other,"But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out comm "
A,Task,"and the cat's looking the other way . "
A,Task,"He's hiding . "
A,Task,"Um cats are sometimes very independent . "
A,Task,"My parents had cats . "
A,Task,"Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Now um "
A,Task,"we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this "
A,Task,"and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros comm "
A,Task,"with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . "
A,Task,"That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . "
A,Task,"Um would be an awful lot of these comm "
A,Task,"would be like what comm a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . "
A,Task,"Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . "
A,Minor,"Now "
A,Task,"if they cost twelve and a half comm you're selling it for twenty five comm you're making twelve and a half Euros each . "
A,Task,"Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million comm "
A,Minor,"that's t uh "
A,Elicit,"can you do the maths "
A,Elicit,"and how many are we selling ? "
D,Task,"Uh yeah . "
D,Elicit,"I was just wondering if that's the um If fifty percent is normal "
A,Elicit,"Mark-up ? "
D,Minor,"B "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Um I would think would be more like sixty percent . "
D,Task,"But um let me "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I have two thoughts . "
D,Other,"One hundred comm fifty percent . "
D,Other,"And and your question is how many do we have to sell ? "
A,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Task,"'cause our market um is international "
A,Minor,"and your problem is has to do with marketing of "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Task,"you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that . "
D,Other,"At twenty five . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"that's um "
A,Task,"To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"that's four million of them ? "
A,Task,"Something like that ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's fifty million Euros . "
A,Task,"In order to make fifty million Euros comm and you're only getting twelve and a half each "
D,Minor,"And if we make "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"That's a lot of selling . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Two four "
D,Task,"Four million . "
A,Other,"To be fifty comm be "
A,Task,"four million . You'd have to sell four million . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Experience with a remote control . "
A,Elicit,"Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? "
B,Elicit,"That that that's the sorta product we're talking about comm one that will work for a in a home environment comm for a T_V_s and "
A,Task,"You're both nodding comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"all three . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time comm "
A,Task,"but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated "
A,Task,"and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another . "
C,Task,"It is true "
C,Task,"that you always sit around you know comm you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something comm there's five different remotes comm and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Y yeah . "
A,Task,"And they don't always talk to each other . "
C,Task,"But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television . "
A,Task,"Don't know . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Are there any um ideas for the remote ? "
A,Elicit,"What would it be for "
A,Task,"and what group would be be for ? "
A,Task,"We have to think about that one . "
D,Task,"We could make a Hello Kitty "
D,Task,"themed remote . "
C,Task,"I think one in b bright colours would be good . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . "
B,Task,"I think one that works would be good . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products . "
D,Minor,"Electrical "
D,Task,"their industrial design is very good . "
C,Task,"I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . "
C,Task,"Like I've got one at home "
C,Task,"that has well comm apart from the obvious comm channels comm channel up comm channel down comm volume comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"you know comm subtitles comm mute comm there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do comm like . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"that's a really good point comm "
D,Task,"because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate comm we tend to um go to menus and then make choices comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Task,"so if it's like an uh volume button comm you know comm you can go in and say mute or or volume . "
D,Task,"We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Task,"make everything menus . "
C,Minor,"Ooh comm "
C,Elicit,"closing the meeting . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um I know this sounds like it was very quick comm "
C,Task,"That was quick . "
A,Minor,"but the "
A,Task,"I think that's the industrial design is the first one comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"that's Kate comm for the working design . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And user comm that's you S Steph comm for the technical functions design comm "
A,Task,"and for marketing the user requirements specification . "
A,Minor,"I think there's going to be a lot of "
A,Task,"we have to help each other "
A,Task,"and work through this as a group comm "
A,Task,"and I think we all comm you know comm we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish comm "
A,Task,"but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done . "
A,Task,"Uh as it says comm we're gonna get individual instructions comm "
A,Task,"but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time comm "
A,Task,"so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . "
A,Elicit,"Do you all agree ? "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it "
A,Task,"and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now "
A,Task,"and go into other things . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm "
A,Task,"so this is the end of the first meeting . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Other,"Thank you all . "
