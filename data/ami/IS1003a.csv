A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"we can start ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Suppose I have to do my presentation . Eh um "
C,Other,"Ah okay . "
C,Elicit,"It's Ada Longmund ? "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Other,"I'll present myself comm "
A,Task,"I'm Ada Longmund comm "
A,Task,"and as you may know it comm I'm the pr project manager . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"we will have to um speak about m the project . "
A,Task,"Our project project is to create um a new remote control "
A,Task,"and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control comm "
A,Task,"so the remote control has to be original comm trendy and um user-friendly . "
A,Other,"Record . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"the project method is the following . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"if we're um the functional design comm you have to do uh any individual work "
A,Task,"and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . "
A,Task,"Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh . "
A,Task,"The tool training is to try out the white board comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard comm "
C,Elicit,"yeah ? "
A,Task,"Maybe you can draw your favourite animal "
A,Task,"and make a list of its favourite characteristics . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"right now ? "
A,Task,"I don't know if we have to do it now comm "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"yeah I think you can do it . "
A,Task,"maybe later later . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . "
B,Other,"Twenty five Euros ? "
D,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it's quite good price comm yeah . "
C,Task,"I it's it's reasonable comm "
C,Minor,"s quite "
D,Task,"It's reasonable comm I think comm yeah . "
C,Other,"yeah . Twenty five . "
A,Minor,"And uh "
C,Minor,"Is "
A,Task,"it will uh be a an international remote control comm "
A,Task,"as we want to sell it in the entire world comm "
A,Task,"and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control . "
A,Task,"Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls comm "
A,Task,"try to create something new "
A,Task,"and people would like to to buy . "
A,Task,"And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes comm "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role "
A,Task,"and you know I suppose you know what you have to do . "
A,Minor,"And uh "
C,Task,"Yeah . I I hope so "
A,Task,"you will have to work on the design "
A,Task,"and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control "
A,Task,"and think of the user requirement specifications . "
D,Task,"Those things just refer to each of each of us comm I think . AMI "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"and "
D,Other,"okay . "
A,Task,"I_D_ comm "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"I_D_ is for the Industrial Design comm "
C,Elicit,"yeah ? "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And U_I_D_ comm it's for the User Interface Designer comm "
B,Task,"That's me . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"and Marketing Expert comm it's me . "
C,Elicit,"yeah ? "
C,Other,"AMI yeah project . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I will manage all all the group . "
C,Task,"you will be the manager yeah "
D,Task,"You can manage all this comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Good . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"you have questions ? "
D,Task,"Um . Not really . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"you all know what the parts of the work you have to do . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"which "
D,Elicit,"you comm the Industrial Designer . "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"I'm user interf I'm user interface design . "
C,Task,"I am the Industrial Design comm yeah "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"And you ? "
C,Task,"I am the Industrial Designer so . "
A,Other,"Mm okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . So "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"what's the difference between "
B,Elicit,"user interface design d industrial design ? "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"I mean comm you have to know . Ah comm you have to know it . "
C,Task,"It's difficult . "
D,Task,"It's your job comm "
D,Other,"so I hope you you know what it is . "
C,Task,"You know very soon . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I suppose you have to design it "
A,Task,"and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it . "
B,Other,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"so I make uh u user interface . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You you de you implement the core functions in the "
A,Task,"And i maybe you will transform it . "
C,Task,"I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so "
B,Task,"Use it . "
B,Minor,"Make make "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"And the uh industrial design comm it is how the object will look like . "
B,Task,"Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh comm it's the function design . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . So "
C,Minor,"the materi "
B,Task,"I design the user f user interface comm "
B,Task,"you design the function . "
A,Task,"Maybe comm it is the outside and the inside . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay right . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"But I was thinking that he's a user "
C,Task,"'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be comm you know . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"But I don't know . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Well . "
D,Task,"You know . "
C,Task,"I'm the industrial designer . "
D,Other,"Oh comm okay comm okay . "
D,Task,"Not the other one . "
C,Other,"So . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . So "
C,Minor,"and the marketing expert will "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"I'm just go "
D,Task,"I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have "
A,Minor,"And "
D,Task,"and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer . "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Other,"Ok Okay . "
A,Task,"And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So you don't have to do something really specific comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"as everybody everybody will have to use it comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"it's sor the same as keyboards . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You know comm you have Qwerty comm Azerty comm French and U_K_ keyboard comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so really the remote control to be international . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And not too expensive . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And uh simple . "
A,Task,"As we want to maximise the benefit . "
B,Task,"And easy to use . "
D,Task,"And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty comm so . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Other,"Ah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros . "
D,Task,"That's the problem . "
C,Minor,"It should be "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Elicit,"is it okay ? "
D,Other,"Mm . It's clear . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"There was a step about drawing something in the in the board comm "
C,Elicit,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"maybe should go and draw an animal . "
C,Elicit,"Is it ? "
C,Elicit,"Are we supposed to do right now ? "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah comm "
B,Task,"you try . Try first . "
C,Other,"Oh right "
C,Minor,"it's it's from the left to the ri It's "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"you think we have to do it now ? "
C,Task,"I d I was thinking "
C,Task,"but I n I'm not sure now . "
B,Task,"You can draw something which is very simple . "
C,Minor,"Oh "
