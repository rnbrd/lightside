A,Minor,"Okay uh "
A,Task,"Agnes comm you can help me for the slide when "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Sure . "
A,Other,"okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"welcome back . "
A,Other,"I hope uh you have a fresh head and a fresh time . "
A,Minor,"How t now the meeting "
A,Task,"actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you . "
A,Task,"And it's in the comm I think uh comm in the sharing folder . "
A,Other,"And uh I will invite uh the Christine and the Ed and uh Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"can you go to the next slide ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah uh "
A,Task,"the agenda of the meeting is opening . "
A,Task,"Then uh I'm going to talk about uh the project management comm "
A,Task,"what I'm going to do comm "
A,Task,"and uh comm of course comm I'm doing the project management and secretary both comm "
A,Minor,"okay comm "
A,Task,"to take the minutes of the meeting . "
A,Task,"And there are three presentations . "
A,Task,"One is uh new project requirements . "
A,Task,"And the second one about uh decision on remote control functions . "
A,Task,"And uh finally we are closing . "
A,Task,"Uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes comm "
A,Task,"so you have to be very quick . "
A,Minor,"And I have come up with the "
A,Task,"management come with the new proposal comm "
A,Elicit,"okay comm "
A,Other,"and I have to discuss a few points on this . "
A,Task,"Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project . "
A,Task,"Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded comm okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design . "
A,Task,"And the second one is about uh the remote control . "
A,Task,"Should be used only for the T_V_ . "
A,Task,"That's what our uh management says . "
A,Task,"And the third point comm it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image comm okay comm with this new project or new product . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"I will invite uh "
A,Task,"Agnes comm can you go to the third slide ? "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"this is the third slide . "
A,Other,"Okay comm . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design . "
B,Minor,"'Kay comm "
B,Task,"do you wanna open the "
C,Task,"Sure . "
C,Elicit,"Um . You're participant "
C,Minor,"s "
B,Task,"I'm number two . "
C,Other,"Two ? "
B,Task,"That's it . "
C,Elicit,"Do you want the mouse comm "
C,Elicit,"or do you want me to "
B,Other,"I'll do the notes . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Other,"thanks . "
B,Minor,"So um well "
B,Task,"I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements comm "
B,Task,"and from my experience comm I wanna uh comm and from research I did comm uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button comm "
B,Task,"you can't uh can't have like uh waffling on this point comm you know . "
B,Minor,"Really have "
B,Minor,"It needs to be able "
B,Task,"y y have to be able to find it . "
B,Task,"Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . "
B,Minor,"So uh comm "
B,Task,"I also comm "
B,Task,"since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product comm "
B,Task,"thought we better look at things that are popular "
B,Task,"and um ex go beyond those comm "
B,Task,"and comm as I said in the first meeting comm "
B,Task,"um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction comm especially in the the uh the outside of the product "
B,Task,"so that it gives the appearance comm "
B,Task,"and it is reliable comm and so forth . "
B,Task,"I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls "
B,Task,"and when they were invented and so forth comm "
B,Minor,"so comm "
B,Task,"I guess this guy Zenith uh created the Flashmatic comm "
B,Task,"which I kinda like the idea comm "
B,Task,"'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the T_V_ on and off comm "
B,Task,"that might be interesting . "
B,Minor,"And um so "
B,Task,"it was highly directional flash light "
B,Task,"that uh you could turn the picture on and off comm "
B,Task,"and the sound on and off comm "
B,Task,"and change channels "
B,Minor,"c "
B,Task,"so I think um those are still requirements we have today comm uh fifty years later . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And uh it was really a pioneering innovation comm "
B,Task,"but it was uh sensitive to the sun comm "
B,Minor,"so that uh it would get would start off by the you'd get "
B,Task,"it would easily cause um problems . "
B,Minor,"So comm uh "
B,Minor,"I in addition to uh looking at the um uh the functional requir "
B,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today "
B,Other,"which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind . "
D,Task,"Fantastic . "
B,Other,"It'd be easy to find . "
B,Minor,"And um it would uh y you'd "
B,Other,"you could throw it at things "
B,Other,"if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off comm you could use it for something else . "
B,Task,"And since I'm not really um Industrial Designer comm "
B,Task,"I didn't really know what to do with this slide . "
B,Task,"But um I just took some different uh schematics "
B,Task,"and I put them into this comm "
B,Task,"and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board . "
B,Task,"I don't know why um we were asked to do this . "
B,Minor,"So comm uh "
B,Task,"personal preferences comm um "
B,Minor,"I think we could "
B,Task,"uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here comm "
B,Task,"and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference . "
B,Task,"So something that's very very flexible and inflatable "
B,Task,"and then you could shrink it . "
B,Task,"I think um it could either be you could go either one extreme comm "
B,Task,"be very colourful comm "
B,Task,"or you could make it clear comm "
B,Task,"and um kind of blend in with things comm "
B,Task,"so you didn't have to um uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user's home . "
B,Task,"Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof comm "
B,Task,"because uh sometimes they fall into cups "
B,Minor,"and comm you know comm "
B,Task,"it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"if you uh mi one of "
B,Task,"one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not comm "
B,Task,"because half the time comm I keep pushing on the remote control comm "
B,Task,"and I don't know if it's actually understood my message comm "
B,Task,"so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue . "
B,Task,"And uh comm course I never wanna replace the battery . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Minor,"that's "
B,Task,"those are my f preferences comm "
B,Task,"and that's my presentation . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"let me uh interrupt you uh "
A,Task,"if you can add other facility comm other feature comm like uh unbreakable . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"because uh especially today comm you know comm you have the family and the kids comm "
A,Minor,"okay comm "
A,Task,"and the kids throw it "
A,Task,"and they they play with their remotes "
B,Task,"Run over it with a car . "
A,Minor,"and . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"if you can add the feature comm okay comm for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay comm with unbreakable comm "
A,Minor,"okay comm "
A,Task,"I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product comm "
B,Task,"Good idea . Good idea comm "
A,Task,"if I'm not wrong . Maybe you can uh add it in that . "
B,Minor,"I'll I'll uh um "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"very good . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm uh "
A,Other,"thank you Christine comm "
A,Elicit,"and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications comm or any discussion on the functional design ? "
C,Elicit,"Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ? "
C,Task,"'Cause comm for example comm in the unbreakable thing comm doing something plastic would be harder comm "
C,Task,"whereas having something like comm I dunno comm steel or titanium isn't really economically viable . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Titanium . "
B,Task,"Titanium would be be heavy comm too comm "
D,Other,"Titanium . "
B,Elicit,"wouldn't it ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"No comm I haven't really "
B,Elicit,"um I wanted feedback comm "
B,Task,"I think we need to rate rank these comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts . "
C,Task,"Sure comm yeah . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"I just wondering whether that you had any sort of "
B,Task,"I like titanium . "
B,Task,"It's light . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Expensive . "
B,Task,"Uh yeah "
C,Other,"The marketing comes out . "
B,Minor,"but uh who who said who said we were comm "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"you know comm "
B,Task,"nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is comm so um "
A,Minor,"Yeah so "
B,Other,"It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"the the "
A,Other,"I'm sorry "
A,Task,"because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing . "
A,Other,"Uh let me go quickly comm maybe if I can go back . "
A,Task,"I know the project plan and the budget . "
A,Other,"So I can close this comm not sure . "
A,Other,"Was in uh S This . "
A,Other,"So let me see where is this file . "
C,Task,"That's Christine's . "
A,Other,"This is Christine . "
C,Task,"And that's mine comm I think . "
A,Other,"That's yours comm okay . "
A,Other,"Saving . "
C,Other,"In modified . "
D,Task,"I don't know comm "
D,Task,"I think verbally we can we can pretty much sell . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm uh "
A,Other,"I will I will send you a mail comm "
A,Elicit,"okay ? "
A,Task,"The project may be the the project aim comm "
A,Elicit,"okay . "
A,Task,"At the end of the day comm the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million Euro . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price "
A,Minor,"and uh what's uh "
A,Task,"how much its cost for the manufacturing "
A,Task,"and how much it's going to be we sell in the market . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Then uh you can come back with your feedback . "
A,Task,"And I I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion . "
A,Task,"This remote control comm okay comm it can be for like universal comm to use for any T_V_ . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"and it will be slim comm "
A,Elicit,"okay comm "
A,Minor,"and uh "
B,Other,"Not fat ? "
A,Task,"Not fat . "
B,Other,"Not fat comm huh . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Might be hard to find comm though . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"But let's try it comm okay comm with the different uh the designs comm okay comm the functional designs . "
B,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"any other questions ? "
D,Task,"Uh from her side comm I don't think uh there's too many more questions . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"If you can come to the "
A,Other,"Thank you Christine for uh time being comm "
A,Task,"so then uh Ed comm so can you tell about "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"from the marketing yeah comm from the marketing side comm just to to give an idea what the management is looking for comm I was looking for a a remote control to have a s "
C,Other,"S 'scuse me for one sec . "
D,Task,"I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro comm "
D,Task,"with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro . "
D,Task,"For what uh I think from what we're trying to find comm we're tr we're looking for comm I don't think that price is exactly in the market . "
D,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"I'll explain myself here now "
D,Minor,"in the sense that uh in a "
D,Task,"in the recent surveys comm uh from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five comm eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy . "
D,Task,"Twenty-five Euros comm uh that's that's a preson reasonable price . "
D,Task,"That's a market price right now . "
D,Task,"Now if we're gonna take a risk comm and push this up a bit comm make it more expensive comm "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"but give them added things that they don't have now comm "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"then it w it could possibly sell . "
D,Task,"Obviously the risk is there . "
D,Task,"Too expensive comm they're not gonna buy . "
D,Task,"But comm I think uh there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting "
D,Task,"is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group comm which always spends more money on trendy new things comm speech recognition is requested . "
D,Task,"And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote . "
B,Other,"Speech recognition? . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Obviously comm we can't make a remote into a computer comm "
D,Task,"but maybe simple commands . "
D,Task,"I dunno comm "
D,Task,"louder comm softer comm on comm off . "
D,Task,"That might be a possibility comm even though it costs more comm to be the first on the market to produce this . "
D,Task,"Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use . "
D,Task,"So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly . "
D,Task,"Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time . "
D,Task,"So maybe one word speech recognition commands comm "
D,Task,"say remote comm and there's a beep beep beep comm "
D,Task,"and they can find it through comm you know comm ten tons of newspapers comm magazines comm whatever you have at home . "
D,Task,"But comm in the cost that uh the management is looking for comm that's not gonna be possible . "
D,Task,"But if it's trendy comm "
D,Task,"if it's fancy comm "
D,Task,"it's got some colour to it comm "
D,Task,"if it's very easy easy to use comm "
D,Task,"if it's got simple remote speech remote uh control comm like I said comm louder comm softer comm change channel comm on comm off comm remote comm it goes beep beep comm "
D,Task,"I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset "
D,Task,"'cause I can't turn the T_V_ on . "
D,Task,"So we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea comm with the ideas of the industrial uh design . "
D,Task,"But comm price obviously we have to talk about . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Elicit,"So what do you think about uh the design ? "
A,Elicit,"Do you think you can make it or uh "
B,Minor,"D "
B,Other,"uh I'm sorry ? "
A,Elicit,"What do you think about uh the design comm uh what he was talking about of the speech recognition ? "
D,Elicit,"Speech recognition . "
B,Minor,"Well comm uh "
B,Task,"training is always an issue with uh commands . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Minor,"might "
B,Task,"uh we can perhaps um do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process comm "
B,Task,"uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost . "
B,Task,"Not sure how . "
B,Task,"But um anyway comm um I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life . "
B,Minor,"And um so comm "
B,Task,"maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly "
B,Task,"so that uh y you know sen send power to it . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"or maybe uh set it out in the sun "
B,Task,"and it uh comm you know comm gets uh comm from the light comm um a a solar cell inside there "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"so that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things . "
C,Task,"It seems also like with the speech recognition comm yeah comm it's a great feature comm "
C,Task,"but if you're watching T_V_ comm there's a lot of ambient sound comm "
C,Task,"and it's words . "
C,Task,"It's not just comm you know comm noises like something hitting . "
C,Task,"It's actual speech comm "
C,Task,"so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech comm and the the user's speech . "
C,Task,"Otherwise comm you can say remote . "
B,Task,"Off . "
C,Task,"But if someone on the screen is saying the same thing comm all of a sudden comm you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies comm "
C,Task,"because they've triggered the remote control "
C,Task,"and it's turned off your T_V_ . "
C,Task,"So comm I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems comm then yeah comm it'd be a really good marketing gimmick . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"But comm I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact "
C,Task,"the situation . "
B,Task,"Very good point . "
D,Other,"Because tha w with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea "
D,Minor,"but th "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"if it's a one-word recognition comm "
D,Task,"'cause I know with telephones and cars and things I've seen in the States comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"a friend of mine says call Mom comm "
D,Task,"and it calls up Mom . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"'Kay "
D,Task,"the radio can be on and everything . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Because I think s with speech recognition comm if uh the the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television . "
D,Task,"If somebody's speaking on the se the television comm they're not gonna stop and say remote comm "
D,Elicit,"okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So I think that uh something could be designed to recognise single word "
C,Task,"Oh yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Like the t like the telephone . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"I think it's a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements . "
D,Minor,"No "
D,Task,"because I this is this is years ago in the United States "
D,Task,"where we're driving down "
D,Task,"and he said call home comm "
D,Task,"and the telephone called immediately "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"so well comm "
D,Task,"that's kinda cute . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Other,"what I can uh suggest to you comm Christine comm "
A,Elicit,"okay comm "
A,Task,"uh if you need some uh the technical feedback comm or some training comm okay comm about uh this facility comm especially for the speech recognition comm I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_ comm "
A,Elicit,"okay comm "
A,Task,"because they're already in this uh speech recognition part comm "
A,Elicit,"okay . "
A,Task,"And uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them comm some kind of a technical tie-up . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"and uh if you want comm I can coordinate comm okay comm to get some information comm "
A,Elicit,"okay comm "
A,Task,"and uh you can uh let me know comm okay comm so what kind of uh the details you require okay comm to add this feature in this project . "
A,Task,"I don't think it's uh the difficult . "
A,Minor,"And uh "
A,Task,"we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop comm apart from uh what today . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Other,"we'll find that out . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"From from your side uh comm you're gonna have to go back the management "
D,Task,"and s be more s precise . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Elicit,"What do they want ? "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Elicit,"Uh comm a risk comm take a risk on the market ? "
D,Elicit,"Something that's gonna cost more comm but could very easily s make a boom in the market ? "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Because it has to be something totally different comm "
D,Task,"has to be total totally new . "
D,Task,"Something that nobody has right now . "
A,Minor,"Yeah but "
D,Task,"And it's gonna cost . "
A,Task,"but end of the day comm you're the sales guy comm "
A,Other,"so I will come back "
A,Other,"and sit on your head "
A,Task,"because uh you are going to give your sales projection comm "
A,Elicit,"okay . "
A,Task,"It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us "
D,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and how much you are going to benefit comm "
D,Task,"Sure . Sure . "
A,Elicit,"okay . "
A,Minor,"And uh comm so "
A,Other,"I don't mind to convince comm okay comm the management to spend some more money on the project comm okay comm if you can make out of "
D,Task,"Obviously . "
A,Other,"the money from this project . "
D,Task,"If the bottom line is positive . "
A,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Minor,"okay "
A,Other,"I don't mind to convince the the management comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"okay . "
A,Task,"The management says comm okay comm so they they don't want certain facilities comm "
A,Task,"which it's already worked comm "
A,Elicit,"okay comm "
A,Task,"they want something uh new comm "
A,Elicit,"okay . "
A,Task,"I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree comm "
A,Task,"I don't think they'll say no for that comm "
A,Elicit,"okay . "
A,Other,"And uh I hope I can convince the management on that comm "
A,Elicit,"okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"if you have any uh new ideas comm okay comm for uh your you can always come up "
A,Task,"and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special comm okay comm coordination comm okay comm between any uh technical companies comm "
A,Task,"which you can uh hide their technology backup comm okay comm for your uh functional design or technical design comm "
A,Elicit,"okay comm "
A,Other,"then I am ready to do that . "
A,Elicit,"And uh what's your comments about uh "
C,Minor,"Um well comm I mean comm "
C,Other,"maybe if I go through my presentation comm you can sort of see what the user perspective is comm and how it ties into the other two comments . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"so you are finish comm Ed comm "
A,Minor,"uh so I can uh "
D,Task,"Yes . Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"I'll uh hand over to Agnes . "
A,Other,"Just gonna close this . "
A,Minor,"T "
A,Elicit,"Uh where are you comm here ? "
C,Task,"Mm participant three . "
A,Other,"Participant three . "
C,Task,"Nope comm "
C,Task,"here "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"so I'll yep . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Good . "
C,Other,"Thanks . "
A,Elicit,"Is it okay ? "
A,Minor,"Alri "
C,Task,"Yeah comm and that's fine . "
C,Minor,"Okay . So comm basically comm "
C,Task,"the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . "
C,Task,"So comm in our case comm existing remote controls . "
C,Task,"And then comm what the good ideas are comm "
C,Task,"and what the bad ideas are comm "
C,Task,"and why they're bad and good comm "
C,Task,"which isn't always as obvious . "
C,Task,"We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad comm "
C,Task,"but when you look comm technically comm at how it works comm sometimes that's not the case . "
C,Task,"Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep comm "
C,Task,"'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work . "
C,Task,"Um and then what the remote control should look like comm "
C,Task,"obviously comm once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"in terms of the functionalities that we need comm you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off . "
C,Task,"You need to change channels comm both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . "
C,Task,"You need to be able to control the volume "
C,Task,"and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls comm in general . "
C,Task,"The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do . "
C,Task,"Um often comm you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done comm "
C,Task,"um which you don't necessarily always remember comm especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often . "
C,Task,"And that the buttons are too small . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"here we've got two examples "
C,Task,"where here on the left-hand side comm you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . "
C,Task,"The buttons comm in a lot of cases comm are tiny . "
C,Task,"Um they're hard to see comm "
C,Task,"and okay comm "
C,Task,"they're labelled comm "
C,Task,"but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . "
C,Task,"Whereas comm on the other side comm you have a much simpler remote control "
C,Task,"that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed . "
C,Task,"And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . "
C,Task,"So comm I would be inclined to go sort of towards this comm in terms of design comm rather than this . "
C,Task,"And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons comm then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons . "
C,Task,"So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit comm or to a minimum comm "
C,Other,"sorry comm "
C,Task,"make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed comm so like the on button being really obvious one comm the channel changing and the volume comm "
C,Task,"and to keep the design basically sleek and simple . "
A,Minor,"Click mm . "
C,Task,"Which comm I think ties into what Christine and Ed have both said fairly reasonably . "
C,Minor,"Um so comm "
C,Task,"that's pretty much it comm "
C,Minor,"an "
C,Elicit,"I don't know if you guys have any questions or "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Other,"it's um comm seems very understandable . "
B,Task,"Clearly your research and uh and ours uh heading in the same direction comm "
C,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"and um uh "
B,Task,"the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it . "
C,Task,"Yes comm that's true . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So uh comm you know comm "
B,Task,"but that's okay . "
B,Task,"That's why we're all here at the table comm "
B,Task,"so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and um w we it's complementary . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh comm when you hold it comm is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Yeah . "
B,Task,"and that's logical and normal "
B,Task,"'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about comm th th the look and the feel comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"and uh comm you're "
C,Minor,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"that's definitely a very important factor comm especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases comm I think . "
B,Task,"First . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Other,"so I don't have any questions . "
B,Other,"Sounds good . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"for anybody need uh any help comm for time being comm on this uh subjects comm okay comm so please come back to me comm "
C,Other,"Oh "
A,Other,"and uh Christine comm maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies "
A,Task,"to help you for uh make a design uh slim comm "
A,Elicit,"okay comm "
A,Task,"and to add some features comm like we are talking about comm the speech recognition and all . "
C,Task,"Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table comm "
C,Minor,"but "
C,Elicit,"do we actually want to incorporate all of them comm "
C,Elicit,"or have we missed anything ? "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide comm "
B,Task,"maybe that would provide some guidance ? "
C,Task,"Sure . "
B,Task,"Doesn't really tell us . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"not really "
A,Minor,"this one we are talk ab "
D,Task,"Individual actions . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"it says individual actions comm "
B,Task,"it says user interf "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"so I'm supposed to do the components concept comm "
B,Task,"supposed to work on the user interface concept comm "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . "
B,Task,"Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach . "
B,Task,"I think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now "
C,Minor,"I thought "
B,Task,"and eliminate them later in the process comm "
B,Task,"that's my suggestion . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"that will be great . "
A,Other,"And uh I'll send you the the minutes of meet "
B,Elicit,"You can object if you want to "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"I I'm just thinking in terms of time comm "
C,Minor,"like if "
D,Task,"She's objecting . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes comm now I'm objecting . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"I mean comm "
C,Elicit,"I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ? "
C,Task,"I mean comm it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features comm um "
C,Task,"and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use comm maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want comm "
C,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Minor,"th we s we still have "
B,Task,"I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting comm "
C,Minor,"guess "
B,Task,"'cause w our meeting time has run out . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Right . "
B,Task,"Somebody else has go to use this room comm "
C,Other,"Sure . "
B,Task,"and comm you know comm we can't hang out here "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and talk about this comm so "
C,Other,"Yeah . Sure . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break comm "
A,Elicit,"okay comm "
A,Task,"then uh we can discuss furthermore comm okay comm with our areas comm "
A,Task,"and uh then we will come back again in the in the next meeting . "
A,Other,"So thanks for coming "
A,Other,"and uh I'll send you minutes of meeting comm "
A,Task,"and uh please put your all information in the sharing folder "
A,Task,"so everybody can share the information . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So let's go for lunch then . "
B,Other,"Thank you very much . "
D,Task,"Agreed . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
