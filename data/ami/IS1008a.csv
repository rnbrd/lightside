A,Task,"First of all I want to ask uh Mister Ed about your uh marketing plan and your product plan and uh "
D,Task,"Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . "
D,Task,"We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm "
A,Elicit,"but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or "
D,Task,"Uh for the moment not yet . "
A,Task,"Oh for the moment not yet comm okay comm "
A,Minor,"but uh what's what's your uh "
A,Elicit,"do you have some project plan comm something with you or "
D,Task,"Good question . "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . "
D,Task,"We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan comm okay comm "
A,Minor,"a discussion with uh "
D,Task,"Certainly by the next meeting . "
A,Task,"By next meeting comm okay that will be great . "
A,Minor,"Uh Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project ? "
C,Elicit,"What is the goal of the project ? "
A,Task,"Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed comm okay comm "
A,Task,"so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . "
D,Task,"I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do . "
D,Task,"We have to define exactly what our product is comm from uh "
A,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Task,"so can you explain uh what exactly the product is ? "
D,Task,"From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee comm "
D,Elicit,"is that right ? "
A,Task,"Oh I think uh comm if I'm not wrong comm we're making the remote control . "
B,Minor,"Um I was wondering "
D,Other,"Remote controls comm "
D,Task,"'cause I had two different things . "
D,Task,"I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television comm "
D,Task,"and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"we'll start with the remote control for television then . "
D,Task,"So we're have to design something that is very user friendly . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"because I think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls comm "
D,Task,"and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window . "
D,Minor,"Uh th most of them ar "
D,Minor,"I don't know "
D,Task,"we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"And uh what abo uh "
A,Elicit,"Christine comm what about your uh the industrial design plan ? "
A,Elicit,"Are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design ? "
C,Task,"Um no comm I I have not begun working on the design comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"and um I uh "
C,Task,"I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control comm "
C,Task,"I thought we were designing a new monitor . "
C,Task,"Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor comm "
C,Task,"and um I understood that that was the project goal . "
C,Task,"So um I'm glad I didn't d do any work um ahead of time "
C,Task,"because uh I clearly didn't understand the project goal . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together "
C,Task,"and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people comm "
C,Task,"and um that's about uh that's "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and I I read through the different steps comm and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . "
A,Elicit,"So uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team comm for the design ? "
C,Elicit,"Uh for the industrial design ? "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Um well comm I would th think that depends on how much money you give us . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"That's "
C,Task,"Um because uh comm you know comm you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah comm but uh before we talk about uh the finance comm okay comm uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market "
A,Elicit,"and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also . "
C,Minor,"Well comm you know um comm "
C,Task,"I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable comm that's uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal comm and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own . "
C,Minor,"So it would really would need to um "
C,Task,"something like the iPod would be good comm seems to have caught on fairly well comm "
C,Minor,"so um d uh "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"you know comm I don't care what it does comm just so it looks cool . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? "
C,Task,"Well comm uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um "
C,Task,"and so I'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go . "
C,Task,"If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month . "
C,Task,"If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but uh I need something in the writing comm "
A,Task,"so like uh what's your functional design comm what's your technical design comm and uh how many people you need for this project comm and what's the time frame you're looking comm okay comm and what is the budget comm maybe uh initial budget you're looking comm okay comm and uh how is going to the market comm okay comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan comm okay comm "
A,Task,"when are you going to introduce comm okay comm and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition comm "
A,Task,"okay comm so I need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm and it's po "
C,Elicit,"And when would you like that ? "
A,Task,"B as soon as possible . "
C,Elicit,"Uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a is close enough ? "
A,Task,"Yes I think uh that would be good comm "
A,Task,"because I need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do comm and uh what cost is comm okay comm and what's the time frame and what's the project plan comm "
A,Task,"because uh without any uh documentations comm I cannot go to the management and say comm so we are going to do this and we need this much money comm "
A,Task,"okay comm so then it's it's difficult for me to say comm okay comm that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you comm initially comm okay comm "
A,Task,"then we can have the further discussion again . "
C,Elicit,"Uh are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? "
A,Task,"Yes comm of course comm "
A,Task,"if you need some help comm uh so let me know . "
A,Task,"So comm who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view comm okay comm to add in any documentation comm or some technical point of view comm "
A,Task,"so just let me know so I can uh coordinate all the teams . "
C,Task,"Okay comm I'll get back to you on that . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And uh Ed uh so what's what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control "
A,Elicit,"and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ? "
D,Task,"Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh comm what they're building comm their designs comm their ideas comm "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"uh th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new comm "
D,Task,"it has to be something that that draws people saying eh comm I like this . "
D,Task,"Whether it works or not comm they have to first say I like this comm I like the design comm "
D,Task,"and then it's gotta be simple to use . "
A,Task,"Yes comm so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine comm okay comm "
A,Task,"because you know what she is going to do it comm okay comm "
A,Task,"and you know how to sell it . Okay comm "
A,Task,"because uh she is doing the design comm "
A,Task,"but you are the core because you are in the marketing comm okay comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money comm the finance comm okay comm tomorrow . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So comm what I prefer comm okay comm so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team comm okay comm who is using the functional design or technical design comm okay comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan comm okay comm how we are going to do the your sales plan comm okay comm "
D,Elicit,"Do we already have a cost limit on this comm th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for comm how much it's gonna sell for comm "
A,Minor,"th "
A,Minor,"Th That that's "
D,Elicit,"that's up that's up to us to decide comm eh ? "
A,Task,"Yes comm that's you have to decide comm okay comm "
A,Task,"so the best thing is you uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself comm okay comm and come up with the cost comm "
A,Task,"and how we are going to compete in the market comm okay comm in the the technically comm or in the sales wise comm okay comm the commercial wise comm okay . "
A,Task,"Then uh we have to design comm okay comm how long it will take the whole project comm okay comm how much is going to cost us comm and how much we are going to benefit for the company . "
A,Task,"Okay comm of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan comm okay comm including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team comm okay comm then it will help me to discuss with the management for further comm okay comm and put it in the the proper project plan . "
A,Task,"Okay comm and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors comm okay comm depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan comm okay comm so you let me know . "
D,Task,"Very good . "
A,Task,"Okay comm I can coordinate comm "
D,Minor,"Very good . "
A,Elicit,"or maybe uh comm you are my coordinator comm am I right ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Between uh all the coor "
B,Task,"Well comm no comm not exactly . "
B,Task,"I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable comm it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her comm so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work comm "
A,Minor,"Th Christine comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Which is "
B,Task,"and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in comm "
B,Task,"but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm so basically you need to interact with Christine more comm okay comm for the user acceptability comm okay comm and the testing comm okay comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"then you will "
B,Task,"Which will also feed into the marketing comm "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"because depending on what users want comm depends on how you sell it comm what tag lines you attach to it comm how you try to make it more attractive to users . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit . "
B,Minor,"Um comm and then "
B,Task,"I guess build the plan based on all of that comm "
B,Task,"because I think you need to take all the factors into account . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"But what I request comm okay comm keep Ed in the loop comm okay comm in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting comm because uh he should know what's happening . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Okay and please please copy all the mails comm okay comm all the discussions to me comm okay comm "
B,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"so I need to submit to the management . "
B,Task,"No problem . "
A,Elicit,"So any questions for uh time being ? "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Elicit,"So comm the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design comm or "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed comm okay comm and how it's going to be work comm "
A,Task,"and uh first of all with your user acceptance comm okay comm how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market comm okay comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"so then we can discuss about uh further things . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So comm we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting . "
A,Elicit,"It's okay ? "
B,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Thanks for coming . "
C,Elicit,"Would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ? "
A,Other,"Yes comm I will . Yes . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
B,Task,"yeah comm that would be useful . "
A,Minor,"I'll copy comm uh "
A,Task,"le let us keep all the emails and all the copies comm okay comm share each other comm okay comm so you know everybody what's happening comm okay ? "
B,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me comm or just send me email comm or uh just come and uh knock my door comm okay comm "
