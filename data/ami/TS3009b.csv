D,Task,"Great man . "
D,Elicit,"Who starts ? "
A,Other,"Well I'll uh start just with another presentation comm "
A,Task,"so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting . "
D,Task,"Alright comm great . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I've put some uh new things in the in the map . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Uh oh . "
A,Task,"This is it . "
A,Task,"I don't know the shortcut comm so "
A,Other,"Ah F_ five . "
A,Task,"Well our functional design meeting comm that's the stage we're in . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting comm what we uh thought we had dec decided . "
A,Minor,"But uh "
A,Task,"Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? "
C,Task,"Well comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um we'll look at th the new project requirements "
A,Minor,"we uh I dunno . "
A,Elicit,"Y you also have uh received that mail comm the new project requirements from our bosses ? "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements comm "
D,Task,"You're the only one . "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"and I'll have a look if "
A,Task,"Well I think we should show them before your presentations comm "
A,Task,"because it's not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't comm because of the new requirements . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . "
A,Task,"We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . "
A,Task,"And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . Uh "
C,Elicit,"We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ? "
A,Task,"Uh yeah comm I think so . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Well uh the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Um now I'll look at show this board . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Other,"Well uh notes comm first meeting . "
A,Minor,"Now . "
A,Task,"I gave a disc a a presentation . "
A,Task,"Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards "
A,Task,"and then we discussed some first ideas . "
A,Task,"So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors comm "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"and uh look at their uh remote controls . "
A,Task,"We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have comm our technical releases . "
C,Minor,"Huh ? "
A,Task,"Uh not too many one buttons . "
A,Task,"One recognisable button in the middle comm where you do the most important functions with . "
A,Task,"And um well they can have two functions comm "
A,Task,"because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um the design has to fit the hand comm be original comm but also be familiar . "
A,Task,"It's uh one of our ideas . "
A,Task,"Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago comm "
A,Other,"so it's not quite uh But well I have to do it . "
C,Other,"Mm-hmm comm now it's right . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from comm "
A,Task,"and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . "
A,Task,"It should be uh recognisable at all times . "
C,Elicit,"It's meant to be easily wiped out comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones . "
A,Task,"And uh the technical aspects um And also labelling of the buttons comm the functions should be universal standards . "
A,Task,"Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"It's quite logical al all of it . "
A,Other,"Um now the new project requirements comm I'll just show them . "
A,Task,"I got this mail from uh our bosses . "
A,Task,"Well comm teletext goes out . "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"We will not use teletext . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Maybe a new sort of thing comm but n but not teletext . "
C,Task,"I I disagree comm "
C,Task,"but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"the second is a bit sh pity "
A,Task,"because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"and they don't want it comm "
A,Task,"because of our time we have for this project . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Minor,"Oh comm alright . "
B,Task,"Oh comm that's a shame . "
A,Task,"So that's a shame comm "
A,Task,"because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . "
A,Task,"Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . "
A,Task,"Um well it's a bit pity "
A,Task,"because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But let's forget about it . "
D,Task,"It's just time-consuming comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so we uh have to go on . "
A,Task,"Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . "
A,Task,"So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan comm maybe a colour comm and um "
A,Task,"Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh comm well as we already said a actually comm uh familiar . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we are a real fashionable company . "
C,Task,"I read uh I read it on the "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I didn't know what company we were comm "
C,Task,"but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So it has to be uh a modern design . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"That's important to know comm uh when you design a thing of course . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have comm our company . "
A,Task,"It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"You want to start ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"I think I have to start . "
A,Other,"Oh you have to start ? "
A,Task,"I didn't see anything about uh who had to start . "
D,Task,"Oh no comm no problem . "
C,Task,"The order ? No . "
A,Task,"Well s then start . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I I just have to uh to think which file's mine comm "
D,Task,"'cause I was uh bit in a hurry . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Well uh "
D,Task,"I think it's this one . "
D,Task,"But I'm not sure . "
A,Task,"You already uh opened uh PowerPoint . "
D,Minor,"Hmm ? Yeah . S "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Yes . This is it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Well comm I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um to start with these points . "
D,Other,"Uh next sheet ? "
D,Other,"Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls comm "
D,Task,"because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . "
D,Task,"Uh comm furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use . "
D,Other,"Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . "
D,Task,"So we have to focus on those three thing three things . "
D,Other,"And in the end I'll um show you our target audience or our target product users comm customers . "
D,Task,"Well comm um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . "
D,Task,"That's seventy five per cent of the current users . "
D,Task,"They don't like it comm "
D,Task,"so we might think about fronts in that section . Um "
D,Task,"They also say comm that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent comm uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . "
D,Task,"So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control . "
D,Task,"Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . "
D,Task,"Uh comm almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . "
D,Task,"So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . "
D,Task,"Furthermore comm it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . "
D,Task,"Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle comm so you can reach it with your thumb . "
C,Task,"You can zap away . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah right . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room . "
D,Task,"So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television comm that's your um your control beeps or something comm that you can find this very easily . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I dunno comm maybe that's an idea . "
A,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"'Cause it's uh a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control comm within the same room . "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Minor,"Oh ? "
A,Task,"It should actually uh It should actually be loose from the television comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"because it can also be used for other televisions . "
A,Task,"So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television comm that bleeps to your remote control comm everyone can use it . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Elicit,"but what if you lose your click-on device ? "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"you can click it on your television . "
D,Task,"Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? "
A,Task,"Yeah in another room comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room . "
A,Minor,"Well yes . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"Well a beeping device would be "
A,Task,"Well we'll have a look at it comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . "
D,Task,"Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . "
D,Task,"So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . "
C,Task,"I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote comm of course . Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah but people don't read manuals . "
C,Elicit,"I didn't read it ? "
C,Other,"Oh comm alright . "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Elicit,"users to uh add one ? Do you think ? "
B,Task,"I don't think "
D,Task,"I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use comm than a manual . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yes "
B,Task,"you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work . "
C,Task,"Yeah alright . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Because they don't use it ? Alright . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Right . "
A,Task,"Well there sh should always be a menu comm "
A,Task,"but it c can be very short . "
D,Task,"And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . "
B,Task,"Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control comm I think . "
A,Other,"Yes okay . "
C,Elicit,"Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ? "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
B,Minor,"Yeah right . "
B,Task,"It sh it should be there comm the manual . "
B,Task,"But but not to explain how the remote works . "
B,Minor,"Only "
D,Task,"And we don't have much time . "
D,Task,"So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it comm than I think . "
A,Task,"Well we are a design team comm "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . "
D,Task,"Yeah right comm right . "
C,Minor,"Isn't it part of the of the u "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Other,"No . No . Never mind . "
A,Task,"Well we'll have a look . "
D,Task,"Next point . Um R_S_I_ . "
A,Other,"Um yes ? "
D,Task,"Well that's about twenty per cent I thought . "
D,Task,"But uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah comm consider the consequences of using your remote . "
C,Task,"Consider the m "
D,Task,"It should be a good in your hand . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"Right comm "
D,Task,"this is the most important part . "
D,Minor,"Um comm we're "
D,Task,"Like the requirements said comm we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience . "
D,Task,"Um comm that's about sixty per cent of the market comm "
D,Task,"so it's uh quite important . "
D,Task,"Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . "
D,Task,"Uh I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty comm ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . "
A,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . "
A,Task,"Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost comm we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh "
C,Task,"It's going to be expensive . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"No . "
D,Task,"Yeah but they think it's really important . "
D,Minor,"So if we want to s "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"If we have a big "
D,Task,"If we make lots of uh of the stuff comm maybe we can uh buy it very cheap comm I dunno . "
D,Minor,"We have to uh "
C,Task,"Well we'll uh consider it uh . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh "
C,Minor,"We'll think abo we'll think "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"I don't have any information on that . So "
A,Minor,"Nigh "
C,Other,"No comm we'll look we'll look into that later . "
A,Task,"I know . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Other,"Alright ? "
D,Task,"And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . "
D,Task,"They also like that comm "
D,Task,"but research is very uh costly . So "
B,Task,"I think that's uh difficult to realise also . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but it it might be important for the sale . "
C,Task,"We have very demanding clients . "
A,Task,"It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think . "
D,Task,"Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . "
A,Minor,"We sh "
A,Task,"Yeah absolutely . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So we might consider L_C_D_ screens . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm alright . "
C,Other,"Well we'll consider both "
B,Minor,"No . "
C,Other,"and and see what uh what what we can find comm I think . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"We don't rule them out uh yet . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Task,"Um comm I think that's it . Um "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Task,"I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"So you can "
D,Task,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Well you "
A,Task,"I c I can uh still see your presentation . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Right . "
A,Minor,"It's in the "
A,Elicit,"Well uh next um I dunno who is next . "
C,Other,"Shall I give a technical talk ? "
B,Task,"Oh you go . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Well go ahead . "
C,Task,"Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . "
A,Minor,"Yip . "
C,Task,"We have that here . "
C,Elicit,"Okay comm how do you enlarge it comm so that you can have the "
A,Task,"F_ five . "
C,Other,"F_ F_ five . "
A,Task,"F_ five . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"Well comm the working design comm "
C,Minor,"that's my uh "
D,Other,"Next button . "
C,Task,"Well alright uh comm you know who I am and what I do . "
C,Task,"So uh we have this . "
C,Task,"It's a bit uh unclear "
C,Task,"because I wanted to copy paste something . "
C,Task,"It was originally in black and white "
D,Minor,"Oh right . "
C,Task,"but it became black and purple . "
D,Task,"Purple . "
C,Task,"But I think you can read it . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . A bit . "
C,Task,"Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . "
C,Minor,"Uh well you can see uh "
D,Task,"Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts . "
C,Task,"And I then can select I can select on the dings "
D,Task,"the p the whole picture . "
C,Task,"It goes to the next page . "
D,Other,"Nah comm uh never mind . "
A,Minor,"Click . "
C,Task,"Well comm you can read it comm "
C,Task,"it's not too difficult . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm go ahead . "
C,Task,"Meanwhile comm this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . "
C,Task,"You have uh basically uh the energy comm the power of the of the remote control comm "
C,Task,"uh and the sender comm w which is the LED comm "
C,Task,"the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the comm no comm to the set . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"And uh the source is of course the user . "
C,Task,"Uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course . "
C,Task,"And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip comm "
C,Task,"and the chip uh sends it to the LED comm "
C,Task,"and the LED sends it to the receiver . "
C,Task,"That's the that's the basic idea . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Very basic . "
C,Task,"Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps . "
C,Task,"Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . "
C,Task,"It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . "
C,Task,"The key a signal to a chip comm "
C,Task,"uh the chip senses the connection . uh and recognise the key . "
C,Elicit,"So well you understand . "
C,Task,"The chip uh produces Morse code comm um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed comm of course . "
C,Task,"And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED comm which is the bulb comm of course . "
C,Task,"Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the comm well it's uh very simple comm and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the the signal comm and performs the assigned task . "
A,Task,"So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . "
A,Task,"And a button for T_V_ . So "
C,Task,"Ah bu Yeah comm but we don't . "
C,Minor,"Uh we "
C,Task,"No no comm but Yeah . "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
C,Task,"Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . "
C,Task,"I've some couple of pictures here . "
C,Task,"It's a very basic one . "
C,Task,"And uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it comm it uh won't look anything like this comm but "
C,Task,"This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . "
C,Task,"It has uh very little buttons and "
C,Minor,"But it it uh it's it's quite um "
C,Task,"Yeah comm you can easily recognise the buttons . "
C,Task,"They're uh far enough apart and an anything . "
C,Task,"It's not very um uh not very high-tech uh "
B,Task,"High tech . "
C,Task,"indeed comm "
C,Task,"and it's not very user-friendly . "
C,Task,"Uh if you look at the shape comm it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . "
C,Task,"So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that comm "
C,Task,"uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly comm "
C,Task,"and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Other,"Can I say something ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . "
D,Task,"Uh the power button is used very much comm channel selection comm volume and teletext . "
D,Task,"Well teletext is not an option comm so that uh "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"But I think it's very important to make um the power comm channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb comm so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"because they are the the most important buttons "
D,Task,"Right . "
C,Minor,"and you can immediately "
D,Task,"Make them big comm "
D,Task,"make them easy to uh to press . "
A,Minor,"Well but but "
C,Task,"You don't have to look and and search for them . "
B,Minor,"You can also like "
A,Task,"if you have um the most used buttons all in one place comm and you keep making the same um well moves . "
D,Task,"Right . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm right . Right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm I was thinking you can "
A,Task,"But if y if you would put it at a different place comm then you have to move your hands comm "
A,Task,"and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
B,Minor,"Are some of the the the um "
D,Task,"That's right . That's right . "
C,Task,"Well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb comm of course . "
D,Minor,"We "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . "
D,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That's very important . "
D,Minor,"And "
B,Task,"Maybe you can make comm for for channel changing comm two little buttons on the side of the remote comm so you can just do like this . "
B,Task,"Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some "
A,Task,"Yes "
A,Task,"I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons . "
D,Elicit,"But is that is that useable ? "
B,Other,"Hmm ? "
D,Elicit,"Do people comm uh when they pick up a remote comm know that they have to do that ? "
D,Task,"It's a f it's a new feature comm "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"Well it it's "
D,Task,"you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah alright comm but "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote "
B,Task,"but if you s say them up and down comm they they'll understand it comm I think . "
A,Task,"Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote comm and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . "
B,Task,"Eighty per cent would . "
C,Minor,"Well comm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm he feels it immediately . "
B,Task,"Yeah that's true . "
A,Task,"That's very irritating comm I think . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah but "
D,Task,"Right comm continue . "
D,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Task,"But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed comm and as you say at the thumb . "
C,Task,"I think that's a good idea comm "
C,Task,"and uh and that the less important uh buttons comm like the the the different channels comm uh the numbers one two three four five as well comm should be uh yeah well not in reach comm "
C,Task,"because uh they don't use it uh all the time . "
C,Task,"Well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"And I have some pictures of the inside workings comm "
C,Task,"but uh I don't want to get too technical comm "
C,Task,"because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
A,Task,"That's your part of the job . "
C,Task,"So yeah exactly "
C,Task,"this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"And uh well that's about it I think . "
C,Task,"Oh yeah comm I still have this . "
C,Task,"Oh I had to delete this comm "
C,Task,"but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"But I had too too little time comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"but uh don't uh don't look at it please . "
A,Other,"Well we understand . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"I I think it's it's clear uh how it works . "
A,Other,"We understand . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm it's clear . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"Oh right comm no . "
C,Task,"That's the most important thing . "
A,Task,"Nice . "
C,Minor,"Alright . Uh "
A,Task,"Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation . "
A,Elicit,"How late is did we start his presentation uh ? "
C,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
D,Task,"I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ? "
A,Minor,"Wha "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well then we have still the time comm so "
D,Task,"Losing time losing time . "
A,Task,"But we do have to come to a decision comm right later on . "
D,Other,"Yeah right . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Well I thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing comm "
B,Task,"but obviously that's not the case . "
D,Task,"I don't think so . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages comm with different links . "
A,Other,"Oh yeah ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah right . "
A,Other,"Uh ? "
B,Task,"For instance you couldn't see this . "
A,Task,"Okay comm yeah well . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Yeah . Well I'm Mike comm User Interface Designer . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"The the method ? "
B,Task,"Well I used my own experience with remotes comm "
B,Task,"took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website comm which are these two . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Elicit,"These are already in use ? "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"these are from from another uh manufacturer . "
D,Other,"Alright comm okay . "
B,Task,"Um This one is engineering-centred comm "
B,Task,"so this one has the most functions and um things . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I like user-centred . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm me too . "
B,Task,"I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We also do that . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Well comm I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also comm and teletext and that kind of stuff . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . "
D,Task,"But we have to reject that comm because of the requirements ? "
B,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm right . "
B,Task,"I um I kinda like the shape . "
B,Task,"I think this is what we talked about . "
B,Minor,"But "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You can't really see uh the differ from different sides . "
C,Minor,"But I think uh "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"I've Well I showed it somewhere . Um "
C,Task,"Uh you can draw it if you Yeah . "
B,Other,"Oh yeah . "
B,Task,"I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . "
B,Task,"So we can can uh yeah customise the "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Well absolutely comm "
A,Task,"but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . "
A,Minor,"So we cannot just uh make someone w "
B,Minor,"Mm ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's a front . "
B,Task,"It's not the the whole remote that changes comm of course . "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front . "
D,Minor,"But it "
B,Minor,"You can "
A,Task,"So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it comm then uh our recognition is totally gone . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's right "
B,Task,"Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's a must . "
B,Task,"So l like Ericsson does every uh "
D,Elicit,"We must have that . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we must . "
C,Task,"We can put it on the on the back side . "
A,Minor,"Yeah well and and "
B,Task,"S something like this . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"It's recognisable . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"We can make a symbol of the company right here . "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"And if you put a front on it comm there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on "
B,Minor,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm so that you don't replace the symbol comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah . Something like that comm "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
B,Minor,"in the Yeah . "
A,Task,"Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"But let's not focus on the front . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Those kind of things . "
A,Task,"Yes . Okay . "
B,Task,"Um Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function . If we we had to include more functions . "
B,Task,"But we don't . "
B,Minor,"So um "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
B,Task,"I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . "
B,Task,"Maybe some less . "
B,Task,"Like eject we don't need comm and some other buttons we don't need . "
B,Minor,"I think uh "
C,Elicit,"Mike comm uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ? "
B,Other,"Yeah comm I will . "
B,Task,"I think uh for the remote um uh less is more . "
B,Task,"The less buttons the better the design . Um "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
B,Task,"We should go with that concept I think . "
B,Other,"I know . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Other,"I've I've got another point . "
A,Task,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Um there are two target audi audiences comm "
D,Task,"and we've uh chose for the younger one . "
D,Task,"Um comm research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"They are high high interested in feature . "
D,Task,"But they are more critical . "
D,Minor,"Fo "
D,Task,"Yeah comm critical . "
C,Other,"The younger uh "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"The younger audience . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . "
A,Minor,"Well what if we um "
A,Task,"I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and the bottom side of the front has a little clip comm "
A,Minor,"a f a little uh "
A,Task,"You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh "
D,Task,"Clip aren't used much . "
C,Minor,"uh "
C,Task,"No "
C,Minor,"um mm usually "
A,Task,"Well but because you say they their features are important comm they want m um a lot comm "
D,Task,"Yeah right . "
C,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"but not "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"but what kind of features ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah I think m most "
B,Task,"Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . "
D,Minor,"Yeah but Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But I've "
C,Minor,"Most uh "
D,Task,"Here comm look at these numbers . "
D,Task,"The newest features are comm like I said comm are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control . "
D,Task,"Our audience comm these people comm are very like these uh features . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Uh . "
D,Elicit,"You see ? "
D,Task,"So we must build in something comm or they will to uh go to the concurrent . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah . "
D,Other,"The concurrent ? "
A,Task,"Competitors . "
D,Other,"Competitors comm right . "
D,Task,"So comm I do think we have to uh have some features . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Even though they cost a little more . "
A,Minor,"Well maybe w we could uh s "
A,Task,"On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something comm "
D,Other,"Right . Right . "
A,Task,"or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . "
A,Task,"And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . "
D,Task,"Like a ticker-tape . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Which programme you are l watching or something . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's nice . "
A,Task,"Those kind of things comm "
A,Task,"uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s . "
A,Task,"And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also comm you they can display which programme you're currently watching . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm right . Yeah right . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Task,"For example . "
A,Task,"It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"we should keep that simple too . "
C,Elicit,"But should it uh really be uh clickable comm uh "
B,Minor,"It will "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"No not clickable . "
A,Task,"Well maybe . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"it should be uh integrated . "
D,Task,"Nah comm no no no . "
C,Task,"or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . "
B,Minor,"I think "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"just at at the top . "
D,Task,"So when you s you sit like this you can can watch . "
D,Task,"I think it should be at the top . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"something like on um some radios in car . "
B,Minor,"You "
B,Task,"Where it's comm yeah comm walking to Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah right . It's a ticker-tape idea . "
A,Task,"R_D_S_s or something . "
C,Task,"But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design comm with the scrolling text and that kind of thing . "
B,Minor,"Wa Yeah . "
D,Task,"Well it's just one script . "
A,Task,"Well I think it's you got It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling comm "
A,Task,"and it's not uh That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm five minutes of ja ja for programming . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So I don't think that's the issue . "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
D,Elicit,"Alright comm we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? "
A,Task,"Uh well I think so comm yes . Um "
B,Task,"Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"Right comm "
D,Task,"I don't know if I can find that comm but "
A,Minor,"We're g "
A,Other,"No but we're we'll have to look into that . "
B,Task,"Or maybe you will get that information uh "
D,Task,"Next time . "
A,Task,"Um we can use this board again comm I think . "
D,Task,"Yeah right . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want comm th the issue . "
A,Elicit,"Where is my presentation ? Uh "
D,Other,"Yeah comm I understand what you're saying . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I mean we're all here now comm I think . "
A,Task,"These I've already given you . "
A,Task,"So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special . "
D,Task,"At the top . "
C,Task,"Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ? "
B,Elicit,"At the top or at the bottom ? "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"The L_C_D_ screen alright "
D,Task,"I think the top is more uh "
C,Task,"but we should start with the power button ? "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"When you s How do you zap ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah but "
D,Task,"You just sit in your chair ? "
C,Other,"Huh ? "
D,Task,"With the remote ? "
B,Task,"Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . "
A,Task,"That thing is terrible . "
B,Task,"'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . "
D,Task,"Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I dunno . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm no Mm . "
C,Minor,"And then uh "
D,Task,"We'll draw two comm "
D,Task,"and then we'll see uh "
C,Task,"Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . "
C,Task,"I dunno what uh you were talking about but "
D,Minor,"No "
D,Minor,"Um he thinks "
C,Task,"we are busy with something . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm right . "
D,Task,"He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom comm "
D,Task,"and I think it's better at the top . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Elicit,"Why do you think it's better at the bottom ? "
A,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom comm "
B,Task,"and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . "
D,Minor,"But your "
C,Task,"But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down comm "
B,Minor,"I c "
C,Task,"so that there's room for the for the interface . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well I d I think that's that's ugly but "
D,Task,"The the ticker The L_C_D_ is like like small . "
D,Task,"It's it's wide . "
D,Task,"It's not not high . But "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point comm "
C,Minor,"And and we can "
B,Minor,"I th "
A,Task,"because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Power button always "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Bottom . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So and and I I like to use the ones on the top . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm y you gotta zap like this "
B,Minor,"or you want to Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window "
D,Minor,"Yeah right . "
D,Task,"But We're making a remote with with a few functions you know . "
C,Task,"Well that's a bit exaggerated . "
C,Task,"Well comm I agree with you . "
C,Task,"It's it's also more recognisable . "
D,Minor,"We "
C,Task,"It looks more like a calculator to people comm if you have the l the the the thing on top . "
A,Task,"Yes "
A,Task,"but we we we we don't want that . "
B,Task,"Yeah you don't want "
A,Task,"We don't want them to look like a calculator . "
B,Task,"You want uh Yeah it it it must be a remote . "
A,Task,"We want to look it like our original but familiar "
C,Task,"Yeah w well comm "
C,Task,"but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"High-tech . "
A,Minor,"Yea "
C,Minor,"uh because I think it's uh "
A,Task,"Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh We White ? "
C,Task,"I think it's still important to have it at the top comm "
D,Task,"Width . "
A,Other,"Width . "
A,Task,"Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ? "
C,Task,"because it's uh it's more familiar that way . "
D,Task,"Th that's not a problem . "
A,Other,"Yeah ? "
D,Minor,"When I draw here it "
D,Other,"Oh . Huh ? "
A,Task,"It's a bit off . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it's off . "
A,Minor,"Well . "
C,Task,"A little a little bit . "
D,Task,"It it needs to be calibrated again . Well "
A,Task,"Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh "
C,Task,"Maybe you should another pen . "
C,Task,"Maybe that's uh better . "
D,Elicit,"Where ? "
C,Task,"You e you only have one pen for that screen . Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's special pen . "
D,Task,"Alright comm we have to make a decision now comm "
D,Task,"because we don't have much time . Um "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"I think we have uh a few functions comm "
D,Task,"and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it comm "
D,Task,"and still have lots of room at the bottom comm where you can put your hand . "
C,Task,"Yeah . I I agree . "
A,Task,"I think it should be at the button comm bottom . "
C,Task,"Well I'm the I I'm the designer comm so um "
B,Other,"At the bottom ? "
A,Task,"Bottom . The L_C_D_ . "
B,Minor,"In a few minutes "
D,Minor,"At the bot "
B,Task,"Oh yeah comm oh yeah comm I totally agree . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"We are two uh V_S_ two . "
A,Task,"Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions comm "
B,Task,"He's the boss . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and then look at the design . "
D,Task,"Right . Great . "
C,Task,"Uh we uh we were busy with that . "
A,Task,"Because we have to decide this . "
C,Task,"Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So comm we have the power button . "
D,Task,"And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"It's uh your it's your job . "
C,Task,"Yeah of course . "
C,Minor,"Uh it's uh . Yeah . W wh "
B,Task,"No it's our job . "
A,Task,"Well we have a power button . "
A,Other,"Guys ? "
C,Task,"While you have to agree comm I can say it's like this and you must agree . Yeah . "
B,Task,"For all of us I think . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm right . "
A,Other,"Guys ? "
D,Task,"Alright comm let's keep it central . "
A,Task,"We have a power button comm setting buttons comm L_C_D_ window comm the number buttons "
B,Task,"The ten numbers ? Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Channel comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"Volume ? "
C,Task,"Volume control . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Uh the mute button . "
C,Task,"Well let's look at your uh design . Uh "
A,Task,"I h love that one . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"I think we we should use something like this um to um The the channel up and channel down button ? Yeah comm in circle comm you know ? "
A,Other,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"Well that's that's also design . "
B,Task,"And and a volume control also in it . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well h ho "
C,Task,"But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else comm a D_V_D_ player or something . So "
A,Task,"Yes . Yes . "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Task,"They are for some uh video uh "
B,Task,"as I already said comm we could drop some of these buttons . "
D,Task,"You should put that uh power button comm channel and volume should have the most uh importance . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think these should be in one big circle in the middle . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true . "
D,Task,"When when you uh put them all in the same place comm the most used buttons comm you're doing the same thing all the time comm "
D,Task,"and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . "
D,Task,"So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . "
A,Task,"Apart . "
A,Task,"So people have to move their hand . "
A,Task,"And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . "
C,Minor,"Y "
A,Task,"That's what I always do comm "
A,Task,"because all my i important buttons are the same place . "
C,Task,"Yeah . It's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Yes ? "
B,Task,"They they need to be centred . "
C,Minor,"No but now y "
A,Minor,"Well not "
C,Task,"W would we have to choose a way in middle ? "
D,Task,"Frequency of uh button use . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . You can see . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"Volume hardly . "
D,Task,"So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart comm I think comm up and down . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"No I don't think . "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Up and down far apart from each other ? "
C,Task,"Far apart ? "
D,Minor,"You "
D,Task,"thinking uh about R_S_I_ ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah but "
B,Minor,"Yeah but "
A,Task,"Well not too much . "
D,Task,"Y look at uh look at the frequency . "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"Nei not too much comm but "
B,Task,"The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . So "
C,Task,"I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together comm "
C,Task,"but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . "
A,Task,"Well for example the power button comm "
A,Minor,"you can "
B,Task,"Well they are used four times an hour comm so "
A,Task,"If someone is constantly z zapping comm it's not going to miss comm that it that the power button is not right beside it . "
A,Other,"Because I have someone But the buttons is way . "
D,Task,"Nei nei nei n I I totally agree . "
A,Task,"So that one can be put away . "
D,Minor,"But just "
D,Task,"Yeah . Right . "
D,Task,"Yeah . I agree . "
A,Task,"The power button can uh be uh uh "
B,Task,"Power bu button should be left at the top . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"And should and should be red . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Oh man comm "
A,Task,"five minutes . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"well five minutes left . "
D,Task,"Right comm just make some decisions . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"The most important things we have to uh "
A,Elicit,"Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ? "
C,Minor,"C c can you make you make "
C,Task,"We can use uh the drawing board now comm I think . "
C,Task,"Uh it it doesn't work well "
C,Task,"but But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing . "
A,Task,"Well I have it here . "
D,Task,"I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . "
A,Task,"Yeah well that's going to take too too much time . "
D,Task,"Just uh you decide that comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"you decide that comm "
C,Task,"Mm . Alright . "
D,Minor,"and ready . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Well the L_C_D_ . "
A,Task,"Um you are Industrial comm "
A,Task,"you are User Interface . "
A,Task,"So I think it's going to go to Mike . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But you will have to make consensus with . "
A,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"Well consensus comm um We we can put it in the middle comm so "
A,Task,"Well it's a bit hard comm "
D,Minor,"Nei . We're No "
A,Task,"because we are going to be uh individually . "
A,Minor,"That's a bit uh "
D,Task,"We're deciding now comm so "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Elicit,"Top or bottom ? "
C,Task,"Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top comm so "
A,Task,"Yes it is . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You say familiarity isn't important but "
A,Task,"Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions comm "
A,Task,"and the design comes into the next round ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah d "
D,Task,"Yeah comm right . Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Alright these functions . "
C,Task,"As we we we we agreed comm we do have a L_C_D_ . "
A,Minor,"The number f "
A,Task,"Well yes comm that's alright . "
C,Task,"So that's that's enough . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"W the number function . "
A,Task,"Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"How do you want it to do then ? "
C,Task,"There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero . "
B,Minor,"Well just when you push a one one and "
A,Task,"It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Minor,"if you "
C,Other,"Oh comm like that . "
B,Task,"On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other comm d it "
C,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"They'd recognise it . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Th that's the most "
A,Task,"Alright so no button for that . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That that's very easy . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ? "
C,Task,"I think these are the the most important functions . "
D,Elicit,"Do you still have the pictures over there ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's about it . "
D,Minor,"You do need the uh multi Or did uh "

D,Task,"Yeah comm I know . "
D,Minor,"But are we "
D,Task,"Alright comm alright uh Now okay . "
A,Minor,"Well uh "
A,Task,"Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes comm all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . "
D,Other,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"So just for a television is that all we need ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"it's most useable this way . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"basic function . "
A,Task,"Teletext is gone . "
A,Task,"So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext "
A,Task,"Oh screen placing . "
A,Task,"We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting . "
A,Task,"Uh there's um screen . You can make it wider and less wide . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . "
C,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
A,Other,"Those two ? "
A,Task,"But it's just two comm and we make a clip ? "
C,Minor,"Uh just two just two under uh under uh "
A,Task,"Th that's a bit uh waste . "
B,Task,"We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Okay comm right . "
C,Minor,"I I think uh "
A,Other,"Or at the top . "
A,Other,"Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go . "
B,Minor,"Or at "
C,Task,"But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . "
B,Minor,"Yeah alright then . "
C,Task,"Uh that's that's too complicated . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"You can just put it somewhere "
C,Task,"They they aren't used much comm not as much as those other comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah "

C,Task,"Yeah s bit smaller and s "
C,Task,"Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah or at the top comm yeah . "
C,Elicit,"What do you think uh those those buttons ? "
C,Elicit,"Above or down ? "
A,Task,"Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote . "
C,Elicit,"And w where ? "
C,Task,"Well we design it later . "

A,Task,"I don't . "
A,Task,"I go to ninety-nine . "
B,Task,"No comm then you press ninety nine . "
D,Other,"Ah uh well whatever comm . "
B,Task,"I think go to video is an irrelevant button comm but "
A,Minor,"Th that's the button uh No . "
C,Task,"But it's easy to go "
C,Task,"If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel comm you do you have to push a to to get below zero . "
A,Task,"No you can ch push zero . "
C,Task,"It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I I think that one button is uh I use it uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons comm you have to have uh channel setting comm "
D,Task,"if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . You have to set the channels . "
A,Minor,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Right all th these uh different buttons you have to "
