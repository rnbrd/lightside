A,Task,"Good . "
C,Other,"Beep . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
B,Elicit,"What ? "
A,Minor,"So well uh "
A,Other,"welcome everyone . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um as you may have noticed I uh "
A,Task,"created separate folders "
A,Task,"because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder comm "
A,Task,"which is for now the detailed design meeting . "
D,Elicit,"That's new one ? "
B,Task,"We didn't make any uh "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm "
C,Task,"we should save that one . "
B,Other,"Oh "
B,Minor,"in "
A,Other,"Then I'll move this one . "
B,Elicit,"Didn't we just do that ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"save in the folder . Save as project . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Other,"Oh "
A,Task,"no comm "
A,Task,"this is just one big document comm "
A,Task,"so you can leave that wherever it is . "
C,Other,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"okay . "
C,Other,"Hmm hmm . "
A,Task,"And we have a evaluation left here . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Agenda . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"not main documents this time . "
B,Minor,"Hmm ? "
A,Minor,"Oh uh yes . "
A,Task,"I have it open myself I guess . "
A,Minor,"Um well "
A,Task,"the detailed design meeting Huh ? "
A,Task,"We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . "
A,Elicit,"Um what are we going to do ? "
A,Task,"I've opened it already . "
A,Task,"Um I'm still going to take some minutes comm "
C,Other,"Oh comm sorry . "
A,Elicit,"and if I'm right comm you two are going to give a prototype presentation ? "
B,Task,"We could . "
A,Elicit,"Aren't you ? "
A,Task,"Yes comm you are . "
A,Elicit,"And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? "
D,Task,"Yep . Yep . "
A,Other,"Good . "
A,Task,"And we have a correct agenda . "
A,Task,"And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice comm "
A,Task,"the finance uh aspect comm whether we can afford what we have designed comm "
A,Task,"and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation comm "
B,Other,"Oops . "
A,Elicit,"how did we work together "
A,Elicit,"and what are the results comm "
A,Elicit,"and how happy are we with those . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
A,Task,"finance uh will be later . "
A,Task,"Now I'd like to give the word to you two . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Get up stand up . "
B,Minor,"Well uh "
C,Minor,"just "
B,Task,"we made a prototype . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Minor,"We first start with the overall uh "
B,Task,"This is about the total remote control . "
C,Other,"View . "
B,Task,"We made it green . "
C,Task,"Just example colour comm "
C,Minor,"so uh "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype . "
B,Task,"It's a fresh colour . "
B,Task,"And uh the screen light blue . "
B,Minor,"Oh uh "
B,Task,"this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . "
B,Task,"And the R_ and R_ logo comm "
B,Task,"it just says R_ and R_ now comm "
B,Minor,"but uh "
C,Elicit,"Okay ? "
B,Elicit,"Any questions so far ? "
D,Task,"Big microphone . "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Oh okay . "
D,Task,"That's the place where it's going to be comm not the size . "
C,Minor,"Uh well comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"it's an idea "
C,Minor,"in a so . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Minor,"y you "
B,Task,"perhaps you should make it a bit big comm "
B,Task,"so people know it's there "
B,Minor,"and uh "
C,Task,"Do not forget it . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
D,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"To function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm okay . Of course . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . "
D,Minor,"Mm . Mm comm th yeah . "
D,Task,"Small . "
C,Minor,"Okay um "
C,Task,"we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . "
C,Minor,"Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um "
B,Task,"You push the scroll button "
C,Task,"Yeah comm you push the scroll button "
B,Task,"and it's claps out "
B,Minor,"if there's a "
C,Task,"and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out "
C,Task,"and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings comm uh remote settings comm et cetera . "
B,Task,"Remote settings comm et cetera . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button comm "
C,Task,"uh as you can see "
C,Other,"oh comm "
C,Task,"it's here comm "
C,Task,"just push it in comm "
C,Task,"uh the menu comes out like this "
C,Task,"and uh i it all becomes visible . Um "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And you could also touch it "
B,Task,"so that it comes out comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers . "
C,Minor,"that's c "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Indeed . "
B,Other,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm um "
C,Task,"it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu comm uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button comm "
C,Task,"and the opportunity to use the teletext comm "
C,Task,"whi which is used uh which should still be used "
C,Task,"and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu comm but in uh Yes . In an apart uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"a separate button for for text comm "
C,Task,"In a separate button comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"okay . "
B,Task,"Perhaps we should use the teletext sign "
B,Minor,"in p yeah . "
C,Other,"A sign comm yeah comm "
C,Minor,"just like "
C,Task,"Okay comm indeed . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"we can uh modify that later . "
B,Task,"Forgot . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Would you like to make any comments about next uh "
B,Minor,"Uh well comm "
B,Task,"this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Task,"Uh the numbers comm which is pretty straight forward . "
B,Task,"We put ano an an extra button in . "
B,Task,"We can erase it comm "
B,Task,"but It's the button where you can switch channels . "
B,Task,"just when you are one and you go to two comm you can or if you go to five comm you can go back to one with that button . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that one comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Previous page comm yeah comm indeed . "
B,Task,"It has a name . "
B,Task,"And uh uh we put that in comm "
C,Other,"Oh my God . "
B,Task,"I thought it would be handy there . "
B,Task,"Uh this the one number or two numbers button . "
B,Task,"Below that comm the page and the sound . "
B,Task,"And uh in the middle the the mute . "
B,Task,"Uh battery indicator . "
B,Task,"It's it's a bit big . "
C,Task,"It's quite large . "
B,Task,"And this is the uh the on off uh knop comm the stand by uh knop . "
B,Task,"Or at least it should look like it . "
B,Task,"And the options uh of teletext . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen comm "
C,Minor,"so it's very uh "
C,Task,"when you uh when you use it comm doesn't uh become irritating to see . "
C,Task,"'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu . "
B,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Task,"'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down comm "
C,Minor,"so "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Well "
B,Task,"this about it comm I think . "
C,Task,"Okay . Huh . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Other,"I will put it back on the on the nice green . "
A,Task,"Looks good . "
A,Elicit,"And I just missed when I was typing The R_R_ stands for ? "
B,Task,"That's the logo of the "
A,Other,"Logo comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"It's th th right now it's only R_ R_ comm but uh "
A,Minor,"Okay well "
C,Task,"Full screen . "
A,Task,"I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course . "
D,Other,"Shit . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Alright . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"the evaluation criteria comm "
B,Other,"Oh full screen comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
D,Task,"Evaluation . "
D,Minor,"'Kay comm "
D,Task,"my task was this time to put up a questionnaire "
D,Task,"by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . "
D,Task,"My name comm my job comm "
D,Minor,"okay . "
C,Minor,"My name comm my job . "
D,Task,"The methods . "
D,Task,"Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven comm from true to false comm "
D,Task,"like question comm is remote big enough comm we can say it's true or it's false by steps . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"One means absolutely not true comm "
D,Task,"seven means true . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are comm "
C,Other,"Sorry comm "
C,Task,"you used the PowerPoint "
D,Elicit,"is the remote control fancy enough comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"is it in innovative enough comm "
D,Elicit,"and is it easy enough to use . "
D,Other,"And then evaluation itself . Uh . "
C,Other,"What ? "
D,Minor,"So . "
C,Other,"Bling . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"First question . "
D,Elicit,"Is the design fancy enough ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
D,Elicit,"Project Manager comm what do you think ? "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"it's looks fancy comm especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"But does it "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? "
C,Minor,"Now uh "
B,Task,"It uh oh it's in the background . Oh . "
C,Minor,"the single curved idea was uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm okay comm "
C,Minor,"you ge um "
B,Task,"Y you should make uh a sideways uh view . "
C,Task,"Yeah . The sideways view comm "
C,Minor,"uh that that that ma "
B,Minor,"It will be comm I guess . Oh comm we can "
C,Minor,"Ho "
C,Task,"not that pen . Not that pen . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Minor,"g I would smart board . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"it might work one time comm huh . "
B,Elicit,"Uh can I draw here or uh "
C,Task,"Suppose so . "
D,Task,"Think . "
B,Other,"Ooh . "
C,Other,"Ah . Oh my God comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm you can . "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"it works . "
B,Task,"it would be uh something like this from the side comm but with a bit of uh curve here comm "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's the single curve indeed . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"if you v flip it like this . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Here's yeah . "
C,Minor,"That's not very i "
C,Task,"it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . "
C,Task,"Uh make it uh rather thick on the top comm "
C,Task,"because uh on the top it has uh the screen comm "
C,Task,"which takes uh in some uh space comm "
C,Task,"and the batteries can be located over there comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . So "
C,Minor,"so uh "
B,Task,"you just make the back of this part a bit bigger comm "
B,Minor,"so that it lays a bit o "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? "
C,Other,"No . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's a bit of problem maybe . "
D,Other,"With two batteries comm the whole print plate and t and top comm and if you're holding it quite a lot I think "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think yeah comm the battery should be in here comm "
B,Task,"because it's just nothing comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"so if you could "
C,Task,"Okay comm indeed . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"'Cause otherwise I think i "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"but we have to rate uh these things now ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm we have to rate . "
D,Elicit,"Is it fancy enough ? "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"True is one comm "
D,Task,"false is seven . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"fancy enough means comm does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . "
B,Task,"I think it does . "
C,Task,"I think so . "
D,Minor,"I think "
B,Task,"I if you don't make it green comm then the elder people won't won't like it . "
C,Task,"It's pretty fancy . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I have to agree comm "
D,Task,"all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"you get th "
D,Task,"it's only design . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I think it does . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"And the design . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I don't know whether older people will use it comm but "
A,Task,"Very new thing . "
A,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Fancy the old people will . "
B,Task,"I would make it a two or something . "
D,Other,"A two ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Huh ? "
C,Task,"It's true comm it's a one . Very fancy . "
B,Task,"Alright comm it's a one . Oh it's a one . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"it's a two . "
A,Task,"Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves comm "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I n used I wouldn I should use that one comm but it doesn't "
B,Other,"But it's a one uh "
D,Minor,"Okay comm no "
B,Minor,"Maybe uh "
D,Elicit,"it's two ? "
D,Task,"True is a one . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Very true comm is it very true "
D,Elicit,"or isn't that true ? "
A,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I'd say two on a scale "
B,Task,"they think it's very true comm "
B,Minor,"but uh "
C,Task,"It's very true comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think two . "
C,Task,"because we designed it to be very fancy comm "
C,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"It's very fancy comm I think . "
B,Minor,"We should perhaps "
C,Elicit,"Have you ever seen a remote control like this ? "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"okay well comm "
C,Other,"No comm okay comm "
A,Task,"that's true . "
C,Task,"so so it's fancy . "
D,Task,"That's fancy enough . "
B,Minor,"That not . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Then ? "
A,Task,"Okay comm one two . "
A,Task,"That doesn't matter that much comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"so make it a one . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Let's give it a two . "
D,Elicit,"Is it innovative ? "
B,Task,"I think it is comm "
D,Elicit,"Enough . "
B,Task,"because it has an L_C_D_ screen comm a mi microphone . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"m "
C,Task,"And uh uh the scroll is rubber comm "
D,Task,"We have for the search function . "
B,Task,"It's from rubber . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"so s "
D,Minor,"The scroller a bit "
C,Minor,"Eno enough to I think . "
D,Task,"I think it's it's a one yeah . "
B,Task,"It's a one I think . "
D,Task,"True . "
D,Elicit,"Also huh uh-huh the buttons comm are they easy to find ? "
D,Task,"That was a big requirement of the old people . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"because they're right on your screen . "
B,Task,"So you can use the b the the arrows . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Task,"They're right on your screen comm "
B,Task,"so I don't know where you'd search . "
C,Minor,"With the ones "
D,Elicit,"Are all the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons comm all the buttons . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I think they are . "
B,Task,"The options are it uh little bit harder comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but if you touch the options then it's uh "
C,Task,"Take a harder look comm "
C,Task,"yeah comm sure . "
D,Minor,"I think th it's "
C,Task,"It's easier than the regular uh remote control . "
D,Minor,"easy t "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I think this is easy now . "
A,Task,"and you use these buttons the most comm "
D,Task,"I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"No they're not comm "
B,Task,"but they're they're they are easy to find . "
D,Task,"to handle . "
D,Task,"True . "
D,Minor,"I would rate it a "
C,Task,"Yeah comm they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls "
C,Task,"where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button . "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm that's true comm that's true . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"which "
D,Task,"But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen comm "
D,Task,"you can have text . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"which number are we going to fill in ? "
B,Task,"I would say yeah . "
C,Task,"I think it's uh it's a two comm at least . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
A,Task,"A two comm yeah ? "
B,Task,"you can make it a two . "
A,Minor,"Two comm three and "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's not perfect comm but "
A,Elicit,"what do you think ? "
D,Task,"I think it's a three . "
C,Other,"A three ? "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
C,Elicit,"And why is that ? "
A,Task,"we have two comm two comm three . "
D,Task,"I personally think comm because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use comm "
D,Task,"it has to be easy to find right away . "
D,Task,"I I think if you have the button at the right comm I don't think you can find the option button that easy . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . "
D,Task,"You can touch it . "
B,Task,"You can touch it . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It said bo both the options . "
B,Task,"You you can touch options . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm "
D,Task,"but you have y then you have here s written option on here comm the teletext button comm "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Okay comm then okay comm good . "
D,Task,"Then I think also two comm yeah . "
B,Task,"You can touch options "
B,Task,"and it's comes out . "
A,Other,"A two comm okay comm "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Other,"A two comm a two . "
A,Minor,"because we have to "
B,Task,"The uh the um Below . "
A,Task,"It's the box below it comm "
C,Task,"Uh the next question the next question . "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
C,Other,"Oh my God . "
A,Task,"Otherwise we have two results in one question . "
B,Task,"It's different . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"next question . "
D,Elicit,"It's easy to use comm as well for younger as elderl elderly people . "
B,Task,"For young people I think it's easy to use . "
D,Task,"Young means sixteen to forty years . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I was uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And elderly from forty eight to their death . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"I think it's "
C,Task,"I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"you're very enthusiastic about your own design comm "
D,Minor,"Also if you're sixty years old "
B,Other,"In the entire mankind . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but because it has the regular uh controls comm "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
C,Minor,"li "
C,Task,"uh as you can see in the screen now comm "
C,Task,"and uh "
C,Task,"you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen . "
C,Task,"So it's t I think it's really easy to use . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"You want these options to "
D,Minor,"Also "
A,Elicit,"As well for the for the older people ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm as well "
C,Task,"Uh sure . "
D,Minor,"as your "
D,Minor,"if you're fif sixty years old comm you're holding one of those things in your hand "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but they they don't want the uh extra options comm "
D,Task,"No comm "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Task,"but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people comm "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? "
D,Minor,"so it it it has to be "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm okay comm "
B,Minor,"but so they could "
B,Task,"Uh I think it is . If they read a manual . "
A,Minor,"Because that might "
D,Other,"If you read the manual comm "
C,Minor,"Perhaps that is one of the most uh "
B,Other,"Yeah comm alright . "
D,Minor,"always . "
A,Other,"M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use . "
B,Task,"Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult . "
C,Minor,"Uh because a lot of "
B,Task,"You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition comm "
C,Task,"Channel one comm channel four comm "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"then you say the question and the answer . "
B,Task,"And that's everything it does comm the speech recognition . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm well "
A,Task,"maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think it would make it uh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think it does . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Because all the people who can't uh "
B,Task,"I would make it two . "
D,Elicit,"Also two ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh a two . Sure comm two . "
D,Elicit,"Not a seven for this ? "
C,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"I'd say three . "
B,Other,"Three ? "
D,Task,"I would also say three . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
B,Elicit,"You ? "
A,Elicit,"we have three three two two "
A,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"Two . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Elicit,"So what are we going to do ? "
B,Task,"Two and a half . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"a three comm "
A,Other,"I see . Uh "
B,Task,"Three ? No . "
C,Task,"Give me more . "
A,Task,"Another question . "
D,Elicit,"Remotes overwhelmed with buttons . "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Other,"No comm "
D,Minor,"that that's that's "
B,Minor,"But um I mean comm "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Tha that's a one comm I think comm that's definitely a one . "
B,Task,"that's definitely one . "
C,Minor,"That's definitely our uh "
B,Minor,"Oh nee comm oh "
B,Elicit,"seven is it ? "
B,Task,"It is . "
D,Task,"No ? "
D,Other,"Oh yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm uh "
B,Task,"the remote score . "
C,Task,"A false comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I think isn't comm this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed . "
A,Task,"because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results comm "
B,Task,"It's not overwhelmed . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"Yeah comm indeed . "
D,Task,"True . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"a one comm "
A,Task,"because we designed for that comm "
D,Elicit,"Remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups . "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"'Cause we make them in different colours comm "
B,Minor,"so that they uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"is optional . "
D,Task,"That's true . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and I though w we had about single colours comm "
A,Task,"but you can also make uh a wood colour comm not just one single colour but a wood-like thing comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . That it that it looks like wood comm like something comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Huh . "
A,Elicit,"can't you ? "
D,Elicit,"Also with rubber ? "
B,Task,"Uh I think you can . "
A,Task,"Whether it looks like wood comm "
A,Task,"it isn't w it isn't wood "
D,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"It it feels like rubber comm "
A,Task,"You can make a print on rubber comm "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Elicit,"can't you ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"So that's a one then comm "
B,Task,"but then when you scratch it it does come off . "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
D,Other,"That's a one ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"it is it is harder to "
B,Minor,"So that's a bit "
A,Elicit,"Do you have many questions ? "
D,Minor,"Uh I have "
C,Minor,"to like "
A,Other,"Oh comm "
A,Minor,"okay well "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Task,"we have time . "
C,Other,"Geez . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but we have We also We have to get to the money . "
C,Task,"We're getting paid . We're getting paid . "
D,Elicit,"The material used is spongy comm "
D,Task,"that that's uh that's a one comm "
D,Task,"that's m rubber . "
B,Other,"What ? "
A,Minor,"What spongy . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm it's very spongy . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I th think it's not the most spongy thing . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Task,"but not it's not very spongy comm "
B,Task,"because it's hard rubber . "
B,Task,"I think it's a three . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's a three comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh-huh comm yeah . "
C,Task,"because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible comm "
B,Task,"Hard but "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"because it has a L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Task,"You can break it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Remote control is hard to lose . "
C,Other,"Hard to lose comm "
C,Task,"yeah it sh and it's easy to find . "
B,Task,"Y yeah comm "
B,Task,"you could you could call it . "
D,Task,"Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . "
D,Task,"If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh set the microphone comm and then you lose it comm then you have lost it . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm y you can lose it comm "
B,Task,"but it isn't hard to lose . "
D,Task,"It isn't hard comm no . "
D,Task,"I think I think this is a two comm personally . "
B,Other,"Two . "
B,Elicit,"That it's hard to lose ? "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"it it is there's the "
C,Task,"Isn't hard to lose . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"it's a six comm you think ? "
A,Task,"so isn't hard to lose you . "
C,Task,"Isn't hard to lose comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Isn't hard to lose . "
B,Other,"So it's a two . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you can lose it comm "
B,Minor,"so I don't "
D,Task,"Yeah . You can't lose it . "
B,Task,"you can make it a three I "
B,Task,"It does have an a built in function . "
D,Minor,"Or if you're you're sixty years old comm your demands "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but a har A hard to lose is good . "
A,Task,"So it should this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it . "
B,Other,"Nee . "
B,Other,"Hard to lose . Oh right . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"this this is hard to lose . "
B,Other,"It is hard to lose . Yeah comm "
B,Task,"so then this is it is almost true comm "
C,Minor,"This "
D,Task,"I think yeah comm I think also . "
A,Task,"A two . "
B,Task,"so a two . "
A,Task,"A two . "
C,Task,"Two comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"And most all because of the option to "
D,Elicit,"Huh ? "
C,Other,"Whoa . "
B,Other,"Ooh . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"it's okay . "
A,Task,"That happens above also . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
C,Other,"Uh . "
A,Task,"But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal comm "
D,Other,"Yeah ? "
D,Other,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Minor,"Oh well comm "
A,Task,"it isn't comm "
B,Task,"it doesn't . "
A,Minor,"well okay . "
A,Task,"Remember . "
C,Task,"put the cor cursor on the . "
D,Other,"Okay okay okay . "
D,Elicit,"Remote control mainly be sold to younger people . "
C,Task,"Click . "
C,Task,"True . "
B,Task,"I think it will comm "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"True . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
D,Elicit,"True ? "
D,Elicit,"Very true ? "
C,Task,"Uh yeah . Uh "
B,Minor,"Uh well "
D,Task,"No comm I don't think very true because the colours . "
A,Other,"There . "
B,Minor,"I a "
B,Task,"a two . "
D,Task,"We have the colours . "
D,Task,"Um we have the buttons is aren't that that much . "
C,Task,"Materials comm "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Nah comm "
D,Task,"the material isn't that "
B,Task,"It's it's much more younger . "
C,Task,"Uh okay . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"I don I think "
C,Task,"So ma uh make it make it a two . "
D,Task,"I think it's a three . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I think it's it's uh a lower number comm "
A,Task,"so better "
A,Task,"because w we designed it for young people especially comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I think it's a two "
D,Minor,"but I uh "
A,Elicit,"didn't we ? "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"Okay comm okay . "
A,Elicit,"What do you think ? "
D,Minor,"I think because "
A,Other,"Questions ? "
C,Task,"A two ? I think it's two . I think it's two too comm two too too . "
A,Other,"Two . Uh-huh . "
D,Other,"yeah ? "
B,Other,"Two two two . "
B,Task,"Let's make everything a two . "
D,Elicit,"In the features ? "
A,Elicit,"Dissatisfy younger people . Um "
B,Other,"Younger people . "
B,Minor,"It has "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"perhaps not . "
B,Minor,"What did "
D,Task,"Because younger peoples are cr critical "
D,Task,"and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Well "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"that it doesn't . "
C,Task,"n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that comm "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"bu but "
C,Task,"but it's for a remote control I think it i it would satisfy those needs . "
B,Task,"I think they like the speech . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm the speech possibility comm "
B,Minor,"You could call to your uh "
D,Task,"L_C_D_ screen and scroll . "
B,Task,"yeah comm and the screen comm "
C,Task,"the colours . "
C,Task,"Scroll options comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but those are more fancy functions comm not not really many features or something . "
B,Task,"Right comm "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"that that that "
A,Task,"It has relatively few features comm "
B,Task,"those are features . "
D,Task,"It's three features comm basically comm "
A,Minor,"with "
D,Task,"the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The microphone is a feature . "
B,Minor,"No comm "
B,Minor,"aren't the features "
B,Task,"the microphone's feature "
B,Task,"and that you can change the channel's feature comm "
B,Task,"and that you can change the volume is feature comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and that you can change the options of the remote comm uh uh something like that . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Ours had other features with "
D,Minor,"I think "
D,Minor,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"and then you have the audio settings comm channel setting comm video settings . "
C,Task,"The easy volume up button . "
B,Task,"Those are features . "
C,Minor,"Remote "
C,Task,"younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . Turn uh turn up the volume . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Minor,"So I've chos I shou "
D,Task,"I think it's it's it's a one . "
B,Elicit,"Enough features ? "
D,Minor,"Personally comm "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"I think once you've "
D,Task,"'cause you have the channel features "
D,Minor,"b "
D,Task,"uh you have the uh screen features comm audio features comm "
D,Minor,"the "
D,Task,"you have all buttons on it which you'd like comm microphone extra comm L_C_D_ screen extra comm scroll thing extra . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"you think one comm "
A,Elicit,"what do you think ? "
B,Task,"I think two or three . "
A,Task,"You . "
A,Other,"three comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Two . "
A,Task,"I'd say three comm "
A,Task,"so two it is then "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah uh "
D,Task,"Make it make it a two . "
B,Task,"a two a two . Just another two . "
A,Minor,"or "
C,Other,"One two three . "
D,Task,"Or make it uh a fucking two . "
B,Task,"We like two . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"You can see the remote control is R_ and R_ . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm there's R_ and R_ in front . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Uh it's not the colour comm "
B,Task,"so maybe you should make two comm "
B,Task,"but it has R_ and R_ . "
D,Minor,"Has "
D,Task,"oh yeah comm "
D,Minor,"do did have nah y "
D,Task,"you have the black one . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And we'll probably make also a yellow one . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but not R_ and R_ yellow I think . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"maybe maybe two . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"m th "
D,Minor,"Maybe two . "
A,Task,"but the logo is on on the front comm "
C,Task,"Okay comm true comm yeah . "
A,Task,"so a two comm yeah comm "
B,Minor,"One d on i it's the colours and the "
D,Other,"X_ marks spot . "
A,Minor,"that's "
D,Elicit,"And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . "
B,Task,"I think it is comm "
B,Elicit,"but I don't know what you think . "
C,Task,"I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm tha that's so true . "
C,Task,"because when you push on the options menu comm you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm uh "
B,Task,"And you can navigate easier comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm you can navigate . Uh . "
B,Task,"because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal T_V_ uh remote . "
D,Task,"I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . "
C,Task,"You're not satisfied comm "
C,Other,"okay . "
D,Task,"No "
D,Task,"comm I'm not not convinc . "
C,Task,"Let's start over again then . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Let's make a different remote . Well "
D,Minor,"Let's go th for inhalation of air] "
B,Other,"Menu . "
D,Task,"I think it would be a t yeah comm two . "
B,Elicit,"A two ? "
D,Task,"Now lower . "
C,Other,"A two . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm well "
B,Task,"We only have twos . "
A,Task,"that's that's pretty good comm "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
C,Task,"Oh yeah comm I think so . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh just twos . One three and a few ones . "
D,Minor,"So okay comm "
C,Task,"And three . "
D,Task,"we have one three comm a one comm that that have to got up . "
B,Task,"Two threes . "
D,Task,"Two two two two two . "
B,Task,"We m mostly have twos comm "
D,Task,"So two comm yeah . The average is a two . "
B,Task,"so it's pretty good . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That is quite good "
C,Other,"The average . "
B,Task,"Yeah . I think so too . "
D,Task,"in my opinion . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
D,Minor,"That "
B,Task,"We can be happy . "
D,Other,"Ooh . "
C,Other,"Save . "
D,Other,"Ooh . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"What is it ? "
B,Task,"It's like a bug or something . "
C,Task,"It's a fly . "
B,Other,"A fly comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Oh m "
B,Other,"A f butterfly . "
D,Task,"Top . "
B,Task,"Yeah . That's it . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"That was your evaluation uh show comm "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"okay comm so "
A,Task,"we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . "
B,Other,"Sure . "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"it's two . The average is two . "
A,Task,"Okay comm good . "
B,Task,"It's good . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um let's see "
A,Other,"oh comm "
A,Task,"it isn't asked to save "
A,Task,"but it did already "
C,Task,"Yeah . Exactly . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I uh uh I uh saved it . "
A,Minor,"And this "
A,Task,"Everything okay . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group comm "
A,Other,"but I am willing to try it . "
A,Task,"Because we are going to look at the finance "
A,Task,"and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Redesign . No . "
A,Task,"And um I'm not sure if I put it in the project folder . "
A,Other,"look on that . "
A,Task,"Um and we're going to calculate the production costs comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty comm "
A,Task,"we're good comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and if they're not we're going to uh re-design comm "
B,Elicit,"So we're going to erase features or something . "
A,Task,"but we have to do that uh very very quick I think comm "
A,Task,"yes . "
A,Task,"Um I don't know if I "
B,Elicit,"Do you have the cost "
B,Minor,"or uh "
A,Task,"put the Excel sheet in the "
B,Other,"Let's hope . "
A,Other,"n not in the "
D,Other,"f fifty five Euros . "
B,Task,"We're going to be here at eight o'clock . "
A,Other,"folder . I think it's "
A,Task,"I think it's still in my own documents folder . "
B,Task,"We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock . "
D,Minor,"No . "
B,Other,"I doubt it . "
A,Other,"Oh shit . "
B,Task,"Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet . "
D,Task,"Yeah mm yeah comm maybe . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"The microphone . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"it was in my uh my information comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It i It wasn't too much . "
B,Minor,"so uh "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"maybe you're going scrap scrap it . "
C,Task,"As well as the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Other,"Whoa . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Minor,"if it doesn't work "
A,Task,"this is it . "
A,Task,"Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in comm "
A,Other,"so that I can also uh take minutes comm "
B,Task,"I want to fill it in comm but uh "
D,Task,"No prob . "
A,Task,"and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions . "
D,Minor,"Ah . "
B,Minor,"But you should uh direct "
D,Other,"Count it ? "
D,Minor,"Li like write it be "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"we have to count some things "
A,Task,"and we have to think about some things . "
C,Elicit,"Count it . "
A,Task,"But you have to fill in this column comm huh ? "
C,Task,"You got Excel to count . "
B,Elicit,"The number of "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"uh count uh number of functions comm "
A,Task,"because for every button you have to pay "
C,Other,"Oh okay . "
C,Minor,"Well "
D,Other,"Ah comm okay comm cool . "
A,Task,"and there are different screen shots comm so or different different screens comm "
C,Minor,"I dra "
C,Other,"uh Danny comm Danny comm I'll do that comm "
D,Other,"Huh ? Yeah ? Oh comm yea yeah comm you design it . Um "
C,Task,"because I draw the uh "
A,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"We've got a battery comm "
B,Elicit,"one or t two batteries comm or not ? "
B,Minor,"nee "
B,Task,"one battery comm with two small batteries . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but it's it's more about the energy source comm "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
A,Elicit,"Do you use a hand dynamo comm a battery comm kinetic or solar cells ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I would do a battery we do . "
D,Task,"Solar cell . "
B,Elicit,"Right ? "
D,Minor,"No "
D,Elicit,"it took a battery ? "
B,Task,"A battery . One battery comm "
A,Task,"We'll wait . "
C,Task,"No comm no solar cell comm no no no no . "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"No hand dynamo . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hand "
B,Other,"Electronics comm simple chip "
D,Minor,"We have "
B,Task,"advanced chip comm "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"we have sample speaker . "
C,Task,"On advanced chip . "
D,Task,"But b al but we also have sample speaker comm do "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"so this one and this one . "
B,Minor,"Uh we ha we have um single "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"we already on nine . "
B,Elicit,"what ? Are we ? "
B,Task,"Oh yay . "
D,Task,"We have double curved . "
C,Task,"Single nee single curved . "
B,Task,"The single . "
D,Other,"Single . "
C,Task,"Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . "
C,Task,"But it isn't three dimensional comm "
D,Minor,"This one is "
B,Minor,"Oh "
C,Minor,"it isn't curved in a l "
B,Minor,"the the "
B,Task,"it's not going to work uh people . "
B,Task,"We have rubber . "
D,Task,"This one is curved like this comm "
D,Elicit,"right . "
A,Other,"I'll just fill it in . "
D,Task,"It's curved like this . "
C,Task,"No no no comm "
C,Task,"single curved is like this . "
A,Elicit,"Um rubber indeed ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Uh that's the only curve you made comm "
D,Minor,"bu what "
C,Task,"not th uh curved like that . "
C,Minor,"That's uh "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"but we have curves like it and it . "
D,Task,"There are two curves comm "
B,Task,"Thirteen ? "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Other,"Oh comm okay I understand comm I understand . "
C,Other,"Huh ? "
B,Task,"With a scroll wheel comm "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Other,"Rubber . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Is he integrated ? "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Elicit,"eh ? "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Elicit,"Push button . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"No comm we don't have push button . "
C,Task,"we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button comm "
C,Minor,"because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s "
B,Other,"Oh yeah comm right comm "
B,Minor,"we want it to it's not it's not no . "
D,Elicit,"L_C_D_ display . "
C,Elicit,"Not going to work ? "
C,Minor,"Okay . Okay um "
B,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Fifteen comm "
B,Task,"oh comm too bad . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Task,"but with special colour we have . "
B,Task,"A special form comm "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Elicit,"But now button supplements . "
C,Task,"We don't got the button supplements . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"we don't have any buttons comm "
B,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"Eighteen and a half comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"damn . "
B,Minor,"we need to uh "
D,Task,"We have to lower it with six points . "
C,Minor,"Damn . "
B,Task,"No comm "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"uh we have fifteen and "
D,Task,"Twelve and half . "
B,Task,"oh comm right . "
B,Task,"We could lose the curve . "
C,Task,"Nah . "
D,Minor,"We could use "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I would lose the curve . "
C,Task,"We could lose the scroll wheel . "
C,Task,"You could make it just a regular scroll wheel . "
B,Task,"But you can't push it comm "
B,Task,"so you have to tap . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm alright . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think that will be our best bet . "
B,Elicit,"So normal scroll wheel ? "
C,Task,"Normal scroll wheel . "
B,Task,"And I think we should lose the curve . "
D,Task,"I think we should scrap the sample speaker . "
C,Minor,"Lose "
D,Task,"It's four pri it four units . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but if you would i "
B,Task,"it is a new feature comm "
B,Task,"it it's something special . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so "
C,Task,"we don't exactly need the single We don't need a curve . "
D,Minor,"But w d wha "
B,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"'S possible to lose curve . "
B,Minor,"the curve doesn't really "
D,Minor,"Curved "
D,Task,"then it will be square . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"then it will won't uh stand up from the table . "
B,Minor,"Then it would just "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Was that "
D,Elicit,"does that mean to it comm single curve ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's meant with scr uh with s curve . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"The curve is uh in a dimension . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"If you make it a flat one comm s n it's no curve comm you got no curves . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"We would lose this one ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but tha that that only is one . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"we could s yeah comm a bit . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"two . "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"one . "
B,Task,"Sixteen point three . "
C,Other,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"okay comm indeed . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"we don't "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"we still "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"we also have to "
C,Minor,"Is it possible to make "
B,Elicit,"Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Other,"No ? "
B,Minor,"Ma y you just can't do that comm or uh "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"And what did you change ? "
A,Task,"You changed the uh scroll wheel "
B,Minor,"We changed th "
A,Elicit,"and "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"and the single curved to uncurved . "
D,Task,"Single curved . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"Flat . "
A,Task,"but it's just one "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think "
A,Task,"point comm "
B,Minor,"No . "
A,Task,"so maybe you should should uh "
D,Task,"Scrap sample speaker ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"That that's uh "
A,Task,"you should you should drop the speech recognition . "
C,Task,"The sample speaker is two d wait comm f s four points . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but it's t "
D,Task,"Yes comm four points . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but it is uh it it is a new feature comm "
A,Task,"And then you can keep the curve . "
B,Task,"it is something special . "
A,Elicit,"Or can't you ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"uh becau uh when you lose the "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? "
D,Minor,"F "
D,Task,"You have to we have to scrap four points . "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"that's difficult . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Or make it on a hand dynamo comm "
A,Task,"but I don't think that will work . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"that's "
C,Task,"no . "
C,Minor,"Make it w uh "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Elicit,"when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"it it i "
C,Minor,"You don't make a remote control of Ah . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"We could make it titanium instead of rubber . "
A,Task,"mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"it also uh it also takes one point less . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed comm "
B,Minor,"Oh . Oh "
B,Elicit,"can I ask something ? "
B,Elicit,"What is special colour ? "
A,Elicit,"yes ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Is that the wood uh wood uh "
D,Task,"I think it is . "
B,Elicit,"this comm we have to have that one too ? "
C,Task,"It isn't . "
C,Other,"What ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but it's only a half . "
A,Task,"But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Sample speaker . "
C,Task,"To knock the sample speaker comm yeah . "
C,Task,"And sample sensor . "
B,Task,"Th then we still have too much "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm "
B,Minor,"if we use the uh "
D,Task,"three . Point three . "
C,Task,"But m yeah comm course comm "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"we we scrap that one ? "
C,Other,"What we'll have . "
D,Other,"Huh ? "
C,Task,"Let's make it thirteen or fourteen . "
D,Minor,"Point twelve . "
B,Minor,"See comm a po "
B,Task,"three . We need point three . "
D,Task,"That's a scroll wheel . "
B,Task,"Uh it's a colour . "
B,Task,"Don't make it wood . "
C,Other,"A colour . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"but a wood "
B,Minor,"Make it uh "
D,Task,"we can make it brown comm dark brown comm not wood . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but it's it's special colour comm "
B,Elicit,"is it "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"a all kind of colours ? "
C,Task,"special colours comm fruity colours . "
B,Task,"It's also green "
D,Minor,"Is it also "
B,Minor,"or uh "
D,Task,"no that that's just normal colour fruit colours . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Normal colours comm yellow "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . "
B,Task,"You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You don't say here's green rubber . "
C,Other,"They don't sell green rubber plants . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you can comm "
B,Minor,"you should you have to lose "
D,Task,"But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display comm "
D,Task,"we have to scrap uh "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"it is the scroll wheel comm I guess . "
C,Task,"No no no . "
D,Task,"s advanced chip . "
D,Minor,"No "
D,Task,"then we have to scrap everything we got "
D,Elicit,"because how many colours we gonna make ? "
D,Task,"Five ? "
C,Task,"If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen "
D,Task,"Then we have two . "
D,Minor,"S "
B,Task,"A push comm "
D,Minor,"touch . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"then it's possible to make . "
D,Task,"Then we can make add two colours on it . "
C,Task,"And then you can and then you can add to the colours . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"two colours it . "
C,Minor,"Special c "
B,Minor,"Switch colours . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"if you lose uh if you lose the "
B,Task,"It was such a great idea . "
C,Task,"You lose this one comm you got eleven point five "
D,Task,"They can add two colours . "
C,Task,"and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve comm for example . "
D,Elicit,"But the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told comm is that all the colours we add "
D,Minor,"or "
C,Other,"How d uh uh how many colours ? "
B,Other,"What do you mean ? "
C,Task,"Special colours comm all the colours you want comm "
C,Minor,"because you want to make p "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but we we we are we have yellow comm red comm uh black comm titanium . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but uh when you use more than one colour comm it's a special colour . "
D,Other,"Ah okay . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour comm "
C,Task,"I suppose . "
B,Task,"'cause you have to add it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but the rubbers alls original black . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"so you always lose the special colour . "
B,Task,"You co you could make it always black comm like normal remote . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"b "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but we're gonna make it yellow uh red comm "
D,Task,"and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . "
C,Task,"Nee "
C,Task,"we we also want to make ano another colour . "
B,Other,"Oh right comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"we should u "
D,Minor,"but m "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We have to make this like four or five or something . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"because we have more colours than only black . "
B,Task,"That's what it means . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"but isn't it per remote that you pay ? "
D,Minor,"I then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special "
B,Other,"Oh right comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Half ? "
B,Elicit,"Is it per remote ? "
A,Task,"I think you pay half per remote . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's right comm "
A,Task,"So each remote with a special colour . "
B,Minor,"and you "
B,Task,"one colour per remote . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm indeed comm yeah . "
B,Task,"So then it is one . "
C,Task,"You don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay okay comm true . True comm true . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"I hope . "
D,Task,"We have two points spare . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"the battery comm "
D,Task,"Nee "
D,Task,"one point . "
A,Task,"we have um advanced chip on print . "
B,Minor,"One . "
B,Task,"So it would be curved comm single curve . "
A,Minor,"Because of thing "
B,Elicit,"Or not ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm well you can at least make it curved again . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Yeah comm single curve . "
B,Task,"y you just can't make a nice remote . "
A,Task,"Because that was very important comm "
B,Task,"It's too bad for the speaker . "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"it's curved comm "
A,Minor,"it's still that "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . "
B,Elicit,"Should we change that tha that that's a one if not comm "
D,Minor,"Mm yep . "
B,Elicit,"or not ? "
A,Task,"We dropped the scroll wheel . "
B,Elicit,"Could you copy it ? "
B,Minor,"And make it uh "
A,Task,"And the rest is the same comm "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
D,Task,"Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . "
A,Elicit,"Am I right ? "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"The entire uh "
C,Other,"Uh . Huh . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Perhaps you can then copy page or so . "
B,Other,"Ooh . "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Minor,"you you made the entire could you "
C,Other,"Undo comm "
C,Other,"undo . "
C,Other,"Undo . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Minor,"not "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"So comm 'kay . "
C,Elicit,"Twenty minutes ? "
B,Minor,"Would you ? "
B,Minor,"By the "
B,Task,"Perhaps you can save this one comm "
B,Task,"and then copy or something . "
B,Other,"Add it copy page . "
B,Other,"Select all . "
A,Minor,"No comm "
A,Minor,"but you c "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Alright comm "
B,Task,"something went wrong . "
D,Other,"Tap . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"but this this new remote we can afford . "
B,Task,"It doesn't work . "
B,Task,"Let's forget . "
D,Task,"It should've work . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so "
C,Elicit,"you had this list at start ? "
A,Other,"Hmm ? "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"No comm I hadn't . "
C,Elicit,"When did you receive this list ? "
A,Task,"I just received it . "
C,Other,"Ah okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Oh "
B,Task,"ignore that . "
A,Other,"They don't work so hard at the finance department . "
C,Other,"Ah okay . "
C,Minor,"I suppose this is a "
B,Minor,"Well comm so "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so "
B,Task,"Too bad . "
C,Task,"we lose the scroll wheel comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"the s "
B,Task,"The microphone . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and that's it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And the microphone . "
B,Task,"A and we changed something comm I guess comm "
B,Elicit,"or not ? "
B,Minor,"We "
B,Other,"Oh no . "
D,Other,"Yep . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Twelve Euro fifty . "
A,Elicit,"Um and did you try to make a new design comm "
A,Elicit,"or what were you trying to do ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I tried to copy that one comm "
B,Task,"but it didn't work . "
A,Other,"It didn't work . "
B,Task,"So we could fix it like tha that it's like this . "
A,Task,"Hmm . Strange . "
B,Task,"You could select it all comm "
B,Task,"but then you can't erase . "
C,Task,"Strange . "
A,Other,"Oh comm you can arrange "
C,Elicit,"You can only re erase ? "
B,Task,"Erase . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
B,Minor,"When you saw th li uh "
B,Task,"Earlier when we selected it comm w I couldn't erase anything . "
C,Other,"Uh comm "
C,Task,"no . "
A,Elicit,"Hmm comm can't you then just say copy ? "
C,Other,"Bling . "
A,Elicit,"New page . "
A,Elicit,"Paste . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Other,"Ah . "
A,Other,"Select none . "
B,Task,"Just tap somewhere . "
C,Task,"just up somewhere b uh besides it comm "
D,Task,"just tap somewhere . "
C,Task,"right . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and now you can erase . "
B,Task,"I don't think I can comm "
B,Task,"but uh we can try . "
C,Task,"Uh comm we already try . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"it should be possible . "
B,Task,"Oh comm yeah comm "
B,Task,"no comm "
A,Task,"Oh no . "
B,Other,"ha-ha . "
A,Minor,"Well "
D,Elicit,"No ? "
A,Task,"you can draw over it with white uh pen . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"we tried it earlier . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"It's very much work . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Sorry . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"but that's also useful for the evaluation comm "
A,Task,"because I think uh we have a prototype now "
D,Task,"Evaluation drops . "
A,Task,"which we can afford "
A,Task,"and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh "
A,Task,"design . Doodle . "
A,Task,"And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . "
D,Task,"And erase the mic . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Other,"goodbye mic . "
C,Other,"All I need is no mic . "
A,Minor,"Let's see comm "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"I already erased half of the line . "
A,Task,"we can save this now . "
C,Other,"Bon chance "
A,Other,"And move back to here . "
B,Task,"Too bad comm oh . "
B,Elicit,"Like this ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Still looks nice . "
A,Other,"And then all green . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
A,Other,"thank you . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"Looks like a iPod . "
B,Task,"that's erase . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Task,"no . "
C,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"Hey comm "
C,Minor,"add "
A,Task,"but you can erase that . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"that's a bit weird . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Uh-oh . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"S Difference between lines and text and the pen . "
B,Task,"now I'm line . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Other,"Right . "
D,Other,"All I need is mic . "
A,Elicit,"And you can't erase this ? "
A,Task,"Hmm comm strange . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"it's weird . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well uh "
A,Task,"just leave it at this "
A,Task,"and quickly save . "
D,Other,"Station page . "
A,Task,"Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . "
C,Minor,"Huh comm "
C,Task,"looks fucking boring now . "
A,Task,"We just did our project evaluation . "
A,Minor,"Um well comm "
A,Other,"I think I can sit for that "
A,Task,"since it's almost my final slide . Um "
A,Elicit,"what did you think about uh the process ? "
A,Elicit,"How satisfied are we ? "
C,Task,"Deadlines were sometimes very short . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Bu but stressful . "
C,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"You think comm no comm my presentation isn't ready . "
C,Task,"And stressful . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Now we worked through each other comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And you could ask things . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"something he said "
B,Task,"you had information I didn't have "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
B,Minor,"and then uh "
D,Task,"and you had information I also had comm "
B,Other,"Oh right . "
D,Task,"so some some things I had in my presentation comm they already told comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what comm huh ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"And uh "
D,Minor,"So yeah comm "
D,Minor,"that "
D,Task,"I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"no comm "
D,Task,"or maybe session of five minutes together or something comm "
D,Task,"and then work separate . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but but why not work here together comm for example ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you could "
C,Elicit,"Why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Well comm "
B,Task,"I think so too . "
A,Task,"probably to simulate the whole working uh process comm "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but then you can work together too "
A,Elicit,"huh comm "
A,Minor,"th "
A,Task,"you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks . "
B,Minor,"when "
D,Minor,"Yeah m yeah comm "
D,Task,"like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by comm I dunno comm chat comm something comm "
C,Task,"Huh comm oh right . "
D,Task,"but now we're completely separated from each other . "
A,Minor,"No . "
B,Minor,"A chat would also be uh "
D,Task,"I don't think that was the best way comm "
D,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"But the technology was uh fantastic . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm the technology's okay . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"I I don't really like the board comm "
B,Task,"it doesn't really work great . Sometimes I think . "
C,Task,"Work now ? "
D,Task,"Yeah okay comm "
D,Minor,"but I don I do I think becau that's because "
C,Minor,"Perhaps it is e "
B,Task,"It does work comm "
B,Task,"but sometimes it doesn't erase "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"or it doesn't uh "
C,Task,"perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so "
C,Task,"and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So you can draw uh see it over th on the screen . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"like the f like a plotters or something comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Other,"Yep yep yep yep yep . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Elicit,"you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful "
A,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"It's useful comm but not m "
B,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it is useful comm but "
B,Task,"it is useful comm "
B,Task,"but it doesn't really work all the time . "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below . "
B,Minor,"Th the pen doesn't "
B,Task,"The line is a bit off . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"so it's maybe a bit unnatural also . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
C,Other,"Alright . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"you can point to where you want the line to be . "
B,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"The project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have comm you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations "
C,Minor,"uh in which you put your uh material in the "
C,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"That wasn't me . "
A,Minor,"Uh so um "
C,Task,"Wasn't me . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"the means comm we discussed the smart board comm "
A,Elicit,"and what about uh this digital pen ? "
B,Minor,"I "
D,Task,"I didn't use it at all . "
B,Task,"I I used it comm "
B,Minor,"it it was "
B,Task,"you can use it comm "
B,Task,"it's quite handy I think . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm well "
C,Minor,"But I didn't I uh "
A,Task,"I use it as a a normal pen "
A,Task,"and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"I used it to y to "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"it did work pretty well . "
C,Task,"I used it too comm "
C,Minor,"but "
C,Other,"oh well . "
D,Task,"I didn't use . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"I don't think why you would want to use it actually comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"No "
C,Minor,"because it shou "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"but it it does work . "
C,Task,"To make some designs comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"It is it is "
C,Task,"it is very easy . "
D,Task,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"and then you can show it to everybody . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"But to write it th yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It's b bi little bit too big to write . "
B,Task,"It doesn't really write normally . "
B,Minor,"It's a bit "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's too big comm it's too fat . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Fat document comm those . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm um "
A,Elicit,"and what about the teamwork ? "
D,Task,"Team work was okay . "
B,Task,"I think it was great comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm well I think so too . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Only thing that we worked through comm past each other . "
A,Minor,"we "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"With some things that was only problem comm "
A,Task,"but that was it was our assignment comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"but it was because we didn't uh "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah comm "
D,Task,"but furthermore better . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point comm "
A,Elicit,"the leadership . "
D,Minor,"That's "
B,Task,"I thought it was good comm "
B,Minor,"but uh Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah comm no prob . Ah . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"well comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"okay . "
C,Task,"Not too much comm not too too too too . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And creativity ? "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"when we look at this I'd say we have been creative comm "
A,Task,"huh ? "
A,Minor,"But "
B,Minor,"Well . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"or the room for "
C,Task,"it was the idea to be creative comm "
A,Minor,"There was room for "
C,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You got some standard ideas in your head "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and this what came out . "
B,Task,"And you get get stuff from the from the computer comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late "
D,Task,"Little bit uh lo yeah . Too late "
C,Minor,"or "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema "
B,Task,"You just sit there for ten minutes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"where is that email ? "
D,Task,"I played I think seven times Solitaire something . "
A,Elicit,"You did ? "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Other,"Oh "
A,Task,"I didn't have time for that . "
B,Elicit,"did you ? "
B,Elicit,"Is it on there ? "
D,Other,"Wha "
