Speaker,DialogAct,Text
A,Task,"Right first time this time . "
A,Other,"Nu "
A,Other,"There we go . "
A,Task,"It's not that complicated comm "
A,Task,"but I get it wrong every time . "
D,Minor,"Okay so "
D,Elicit,"we are just waiting for Matthew . "
A,Task,"For Matthew comm yep . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Uh So "
B,Task,"I suggest we start the meeting uh without Matthew uh "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Mm 'kay . "
B,Task,"he's uh obviously late for some reason . "
B,Minor,"Good . Um . "
B,Task,"Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design . "
B,Task,"I hope uh you both did some uh some work uh concerning a uh conceptual design . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um this will be the uh agenda for the meeting uh . "
B,Task,"Uh I will take some minutes uh again . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members comm "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"and that uh will uh "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Minor,"who has the fir "
B,Elicit,"do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready ? "
A,Task,"I have a presentation comm "
A,Minor,"I'm just making this "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"I think yeah the Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"because it's really a a team uh project with a team "
B,Minor,"Ah "
B,Task,"there is Matthew . "
D,Task,"and if someone is not here then we cannot "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
D,Task,"but it's okay it's good . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Other,"I'll just email you this file comm my presentation . "
B,Minor,"So . "
B,Task,"Good . "
B,Elicit,"Do presentation ready ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm "
A,Task,"I'm just emailing it to you . "
B,Other,"Oh okay . "
C,Other,"So "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"did you manage uh "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"I sent you the slides comm "
C,Elicit,"you didn't see them ? "
B,Task,"Oh yes I see him comm good yes . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"No . "
C,Minor,". "
C,Other,"So "
C,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Okay it should've gone through to you . "
B,Task,"Okay mm yes I have it . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Okay so "
A,Task,"this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . "
A,Other,"Um can I just put this on ? "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . "
A,Other,"Um . This is to do this I will not remove my microphone . "
A,Task,"We basically used um some focus group surveys "
A,Task,"which I went through with you last time comm the main results of that comm "
A,Task,"and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um comm "
A,Minor,"and as part of this "
A,Task,"The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . "
A,Task,"The most important by far was the look and feel of it . "
A,Task,"It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . It needs to stand out . "
A,Task,"It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . "
A,Task,"Most people find remote controls boring at the moment comm "
A,Task,"we need to have something that looks interesting comm that looks exciting comm that will stand out . "
A,Task,"People will wanna buy it . Um "
A,Task,"That was twice as i important as the next item on here "
A,Task,"which is that it has to be technologically innovative "
A,Task,"has to have something else comm apart from just the look of it . "
A,Task,"People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want . That's a really cool feature comm "
A,Task,"and it has to make them wanna buy it again . "
A,Task,"Third on the list comm and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect comm "
A,Task,"it has to be easy to use . "
A,Task,"So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . "
A,Task,"Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment comm uh fruit and vegetables um . "
A,Task,"This is basically talking about just the the feel of it comm so probably not the smell of it comm but the bright colours comm um eye-catching comm really bold designs comm and a spongy feel . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Um I had a talk to the design people about this comm "
A,Task,"but having a remote that's tactile comm that feels different comm that would be really cool . "
A,Task,"That would make it stand out . Um . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"can you repeat "
D,Elicit,"and be more precise about what you just said ? "
B,Elicit,"Spongy feel ? "
D,Minor,"Uh about the feeling "
D,Task,"yeah "
D,Minor,"uh yo "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"ma make it not necessar sp "
C,Minor,"You can "
A,Task,"spongy is the current thing . Spongy is the current texture comm "
A,Task,"but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all comm "
A,Task,"so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something comm that'll be something that sets it apart comm "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"as far as the design goes comm the very most important aspect was the design comm to the customers . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"going with the fruit and vegetable idea comm we've got the bright colours comm so makes it stand out comm the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours comm part of the fruit and vegetables um . "
A,Task,"Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones comm "
A,Minor,"they've all got those "
A,Task,"a lot of them have the changeable covers comm "
A,Task,"so they can choose what colour the outside is . "
A,Task,"That's one way of looking at it um . "
A,Task,"Textured feel we just talked about . "
A,Task,"Maybe it's another way of doing that . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture comm a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . "
A,Task,"So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room comm or just what they like comm their sports team or whatever . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's a very good idea comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um and yeah comm "
A,Task,"still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality comm the way the mobile phones work comm the way the keypad looks . "
A,Task,"Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . "
A,Task,"They're big selling items . "
A,Task,"People put a lot of thought into that "
A,Task,"so we can leverage off that comm "
A,Task,"and we can start using some of their ideas . "
A,Task,"Um back to technological in in innovation comm not quite as important comm "
A,Task,"but still a big issue . "
A,Task,"Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost comm "
A,Task,"uh that's one thing we could look at . "
A,Task,"There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't I don't think comm in my personal opinion comm gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I think we're better doing something basic like this "
A,Task,"which is very important "
A,Task,"and very will be a really cool feature to put in . "
A,Task,"And use . I had no real specific ideas for this comm "
A,Task,"maybe we just comm the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe comm by themselves comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yes well "
B,Task,"maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the "
A,Minor,"and then "
A,Task,"yeah "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Other,"Voila . "
A,Task,"Yep and that's the presentation . "
B,Other,"Okay good comm "
B,Task,"that's very clear . "
D,Task,"Yeah very clear . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . Um . Uh "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? "
A,Minor,"I think you "
B,Task,"Maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel "
B,Minor,"of uh I've "
B,Task,"it was a good idea maybe to to "
D,Elicit,"To let the people choose comm you mean ? "
B,Task,"Yes the the the there are changeable covers comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it "
B,Task,"because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies "
B,Task,"uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"we're selling so many units of this . "
A,Task,"This is gonna be a mass marketed product comm "
B,Minor,"Hmm . Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"we can afford to have two or three different designs at least . "
D,Task,"Yeah a range of uh yeah comm a set of three comm four different aspects . "
B,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Mm mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Sure that fits the "
B,Minor,"Yes "
B,Minor,"and of course it will be a we we get a "
B,Task,"if it works we can get uh after-sales "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I mean that would would be very good "
B,Task,"I mean those covers could go for for three comm five Euro . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"That's a very good idea um "
B,Task,"And then uh maybe uh we can go a th Matthew's presentation "
B,Minor,"because "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"s "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"the "
C,Task,"then we could discuss later "
C,Minor,"like "
C,Task,"we can put all ideas together . "
B,Task,"Together indeed uh comm "
A,Task,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah I agree . "
B,Task,"because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use comm "
C,Task,"It should be easier with that . "
B,Task,"what you were already mentioning . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And your part is very related to mine "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah so "
C,Other,"I'll I'll go with that actually "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"so um "
C,Minor,"Okay so m so "
C,Task,"then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures comm different forms comm "
C,Task,"and uh they could be like buttons "
C,Task,"and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other comm "
C,Task,"and uh maybe like you can have different colours "
C,Task,"for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . "
C,Task,"So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So what I have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the T_V_ comm V_C_R_ comm music system operated ones actually comm "
C,Task,"and they are very specific to each other comm "
C,Task,"but there are some common keys "
C,Task,"for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"and uh "
C,Task,"There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information comm names comm "
C,Minor,"like "
C,Minor,"You can basically "
C,Task,"if you have a multiple functionality comm say T_V_ comm V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the T_V_ comm and you can programme the keys if you want to comm certain keys are even the channel information . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ comm rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah "
A,Task,"That's a good idea . "
C,Minor,"so you you you can just uh "
C,Task,"because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"even if you arrange it by however you arrange it comm you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Mm . Yeah I really like that idea . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"what functionalities do you suggest for that ? For facing this problem ? "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"it it it's like "
C,Task,"it limited one . "
C,Task,"In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing comm eighty word comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement comm like eighty to hundred word . "
C,Task,"Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"you want to st store your favourite channel . "
A,Task,"Maybe ten channels comm yeah at the most . "
C,Task,"Yeah some ten twelve channel information . "
C,Minor,"You know "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"And uh basically uh "
C,Task,"it depends "
C,Task,"like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing "
C,Task,"because you have multiple functionalities "
C,Task,"for example you are watching a movie comm and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is now comm "
C,Minor,"so I am using the T_V_ so every time I use it comm it could be like comm "
C,Task,"for example I can use a simple toggle switch comm and a display comm "
C,Task,"so I press it so the display says comm okay comm I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is comm instead of having three keys separately for four keys comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Oh yeah yeah yeah mm . "
C,Task,"to model the functionalities will increase actually comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"and for you and you might want "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"you don't want separate keys for all of them . "
C,Task,"You can't . "
C,Minor,"And uh well "
C,Task,"there can be children friendly "
C,Task,"where you can programme your remote "
C,Task,"so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them comm and you can operate them . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present . "
C,Task,"I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote comm "
C,Task,"is uh um is a good idea comm "
C,Minor,"like "
C,Task,"instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having comm um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit "
C,Task,"that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine comm "
C,Task,"and so if you say hello coffee machine comm it say hi Joe comm or something like that comm "
A,Minor,"Mm b "
C,Minor,"you know comm and uh "
A,Task,"But a coffee machine comm there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"you you won't be using it comm "
C,Task,"so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing comm and very isolated word "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and it's uh it is interesting comm and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys comm on the display for the browsing "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"which is again "
C,Task,"and maybe having something like a blinking thing comm "
C,Task,"like uh it could indicate you're uh it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote comm the blinking . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"At the same time comm if it's a dark room comm it can be used to locate the remote also "
C,Minor,"or "
D,Minor,"And you want "
D,Minor,"okay "
D,Minor,"for "
D,Task,"coming back to one point "
A,Task,"Two thirty five supposed to finish . "
D,Elicit,"y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? Some of them ? "
C,Task,"Yeah you can let them to do that . "
D,Elicit,"And uh isn't that too difficult "
D,Minor,"for the we want w "
D,Elicit,"I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to be easy to use comm "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"that's the compromise . "
C,Task,"N no "
C,Minor,"but the if you give "
C,Task,"it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Like for example uh I would like to store in certain way comm "
C,Task,"so if you want to give the full freedom to the user "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think you can do it both ways . "
C,Minor,"So it de "
A,Task,"You can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it comm "
D,Task,"A standard . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features . "
B,Minor,"Um yes "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"but but I do "
B,Task,"maybe you can give a hand to us "
B,Task,"because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents . "
B,Other,"I'm sorry to have Every time I have to come down on this price again "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"to "
B,Task,"so this might be a little limiting for your creativity comm "
B,Minor,"but it's it's it's the real "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"We have to consider it . "
B,Minor,"S so "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition comm I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro "
B,Task,"but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm "
D,Minor,"yeah like "
D,Task,"I would say that for programming uh keys comm you said comm uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"but for the A_S_R_ system comm uh I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this "
C,Minor,"We well "
C,Minor,"we can still look at "
D,Minor,"We "
C,Task,"we can talk with the coffee unit "
C,Minor,"and you can uh check how much how much they "
D,Task,"Exactly yeah "
D,Task,"i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented comm "
C,Task,"yeah yeah "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"and w how much it's cost comm maybe with a f cheap chip . "
C,Task,"Maybe we can come we we can talk to them comm and we can come with that comm "
B,Minor,"Mm mm . "
C,Minor,"you know . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something "
C,Task,"maybe if you added little bit of display comm "
C,Task,"you might need the to che keep checking the battery comm "
C,Task,"so you really need a some kind of indicator comm "
C,Task,"so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"it could actually be used to detect also . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark comm "
A,Task,"so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them "
A,Task,"or if they if they light up or something . "
C,Task,"No "
C,Minor,"actually "
C,Minor,"i if i it is like "
C,Minor,"you know "
C,Minor,"it tells you um comm "
C,Task,"it can be for two purposes comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"like if you have an L_C_D_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"which is having "
C,Task,"uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of D_C_ . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"It may need more actually comm "
C,Task,"so y you you may need to check your battery usage "
C,Minor,"it "
C,Task,"and then you need that comm some functionality to indicate the battery limit . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"It's true . "
C,Task,"And then if the battery limit is indicated comm if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and it can change the colour depending on your uh how much is the battery comm "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"that is good enough to even locate even if you want to . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"You know . "
B,Other,"'Kay good . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Elicit,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"so "
D,Elicit,"I don't know how if if I have time to talk about the "
B,Minor,"Mm yes um "
C,Elicit,"You you have time some more ? "
B,Minor,"I would "
C,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Yes yes you can you can still . We have time . "
C,Task,"Sure you can you know . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Other,"what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control comm and how is it manufactured h what is the process comm just to explain you . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"the method is ther "
D,Task,"there is a a set of components in a in a remote control "
D,Minor,"like comm and uh what cost "
D,Task,"the the components in themself do not cost a lot "
D,Task,"but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously comm "
D,Other,"and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"there are two uh different types of uh um Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control . "
B,Other,"Nice . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an "
D,Task,"that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led "
D,Task,"that will uh transmit to the receiver . "
D,Minor,"And uh yeah "
D,Task,"the other components and the circuit board buttons comm infrared comm led comm etcetera comm for the components "
D,Minor,"um . So "
D,Minor,"you finding comm "
D,Task,"just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed comm "
D,Task,"and then it translate to the key comm to a sequence comm something like morse code comm as you know comm uh with a different sequence for each key comm "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"and uh uh "
D,Minor,"that's comm "
D,Task,"with the components we will use comm we will have different uh messages comm different sequences comm "
D,Task,"and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor "
D,Task,"that amplify to make it stronger "
D,Minor,"um . So "
D,Task,"electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards "
D,Task,"uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . "
D,Minor,"And uh so "
D,Task,"I think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology comm "
C,Other,"Yeah mm mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and this is important comm "
D,Task,"and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Other,"my personal design "
D,Elicit,"we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . "
D,Task,"If it's plastic "
D,Task,"or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit comm veg or "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"Well well "
B,Task,"m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but comm with the changeable covers to fancy it up . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in comm for instance comm a wooden case . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Mm just have a yeah "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"like they do in with cars I think . Yeah inside the car "
A,Task,"Just the veneer on it comm "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"they also emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons comm a scroll wheels comm integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse . And uh very cheap L_C_D_s comm so liquid crystal displays comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so I'm wondering comm I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ . "
D,Task,"And the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some uh compromise to to do . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip comm "
D,Task,"but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range "
D,Elicit,"alright . "
D,Task,"And the display requires an advanced chip comm "
D,Task,"which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip comm "
D,Task,"but I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items comm then I think w we could be able to handle that . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Other,"to to sum up um "
D,Minor,"we need "
D,Minor,"yeah so "
D,Task,"I I just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed "
D,Task,"and um and um assembly is a an important process "
D,Task,"that has to be taken into account . "
D,Task,"And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"so that we can it's really a team-working "
D,Minor,"uh . So "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I I cannot design something without your agreement comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah so "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"No of course . "
C,Task,"of course "
C,Elicit,"for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there comm "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Elicit,"or if you want to store a programmes with a keys "
C,Elicit,"What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside "
C,Minor,"W wh what "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"it's kind of um simple pro progra programmable device comm and we have to insert . "
C,Minor,"W what "
C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions "
C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"of "
C,Minor,"Okay so "
C,Task,"in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card . "
D,Task,"Exactly yeah comm for customizing and yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"where they do all the wi with with them actually . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah good idea . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"I f "
B,Task,"I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um so "
B,Task,"I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip comm "
B,Task,"but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip comm "
B,Task,"so can we use same chip comm "
B,Task,"so with one expensive chip we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features . "
D,Task,"Exactly yeah that's a very good idea comm "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle comm uh it's called F_P_G_A_ chip comm that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh L_C_D_ "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"and "
D,Other,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget comm uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip comm "
B,Task,"so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"D "
C,Minor,"well "
B,Elicit,"Do you think that's feasible ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know . "
B,Elicit,"Uh You th you think it's possible . "
C,Elicit,"Is it possible to fit in to that ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"also thinking comm "
D,Task,"I think both uh if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros comm it will be okay comm "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"but uh . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"maybe we need specific costings then . "
A,Minor,"Actually "
A,Task,"do maybe two designs "
A,Task,"and then cost them out "
A,Task,"and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's an excellent idea . "
B,Task,"Mm yes "
B,Task,"wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah . Yeah "
B,Task,"That w that would be a very good idea . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"because right now I don't have price in in head "
D,Other,"but for next meeting I'm sure yeah be able to do that . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Good good . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"that's uh that's something which I wanted to ask you also comm "
C,Elicit,"like what will be the each individually the cost of it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"For example if f if you want to put wood I wouldn't suggest for wood "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"uh 'cause it's I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood . "
D,Task,"I agree on that . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"It will be much ch much expensive "
C,Task,"th though it's the most natural thing comm "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"Yes "
B,Minor,"but I can "
B,Task,"I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition comm "
B,Task,"and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"it's uh "
B,Task,"which which come with a with another price . "
C,Task,"Yeah we we can give a preference to them comm "
C,Minor,"but it is "
C,Task,"but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for "
B,Elicit,"Do do you agree ? "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood comm "
A,Task,"Mm yeah sure . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user comm and maybe with uh graphs or I don't know uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"User Interface Designer you could maybe uh help us on that . "
B,Minor,"Ma I "
B,Task,"I think uh for next meeting we c you two can present a real design . Uh so drawing it on the board . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yea "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Perfect yeah . "
B,Task,"And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs comm one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price . "
C,Task,"Yeah sure . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"we will uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"which can be later uh fancied up with uh with addit uh additional uh comm how do you call them comm these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But that that that that can be done later . "
D,Task,"Yeah customized . "
B,Task,"We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control . "
C,Minor,". "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"We can give them smooth keys comm "
C,Elicit,"you know . "
C,Minor,"Smooth keys with bigger s uh So that you know "
C,Task,"The the problem most of the time we've seen comm the keys is that it's small comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"and every time we have to be very but if i the if we "
C,Task,"if we go to a different ways of designing those keys comm then you can merge them together "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"is there any of these that you're looking at particularly "
C,Minor,"to "
A,Elicit,"or is this just ideas ? "
C,Minor,"Oh "
C,Task,"you can actually comm "
C,Task,"for example comm if you see comm they are they are they are quite small over here comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"and uh now you can comm "
C,Task,"for example comm as I was if you make them big comm it may change the look of the thing also to the people . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"At the same time comm it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all problem . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Mm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes yes yes "
B,Task,"bi big keys is is good thing I think . "
C,Minor,"Uh big keys may better for them actually and uh "
A,Other,"You see ? "
D,Task,"I agree yeah comm "
D,Task,"and not too m too many keys of course yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"No no . "
A,Minor,"Mm well "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"one I've had before comm a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom "
A,Task,"so the bottom bit is just comm covers half the keys most of the time comm "
B,Minor,"Mm mm mm . "
A,Task,"and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys . "
B,Minor,"Mm w but then you have still have uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"when you don't use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control "
B,Task,"which you don't use . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"So maybe it's possible uh comm I don't know whether you can can indicate this comm that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um yeah "
A,Task,"I've seen that before too . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Anoth another like b "
A,Task,"it flips up "
A,Task,"and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"so it's something like this comm the model here "
C,Minor,"s you can put the keys "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"But I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well . "
D,Elicit,"That's what you mean ? "
B,Task,"Yes I I th that's what I mean "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"so I mean something like like a book . "
A,Task,"I like this one . I like the shape of this one . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Can we have "
A,Elicit,"can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one comm so with not just the straight little box "
D,Task,"Yeah I like also this one . "
A,Minor,"that's a "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"maybe curved or something . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm mm . "
D,Minor,"the point is w "
D,Task,"maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be "
D,Task,"and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or "
A,Task,"Mm mm 'kay . "
C,Minor,"We should make a "
A,Elicit,"Is this for the next meeting though ? "
A,Task,"I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"that yeah next meeting we should be "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Ju just make two designs comm "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"that would depend upon us actually . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"and the we we can decide decide between th those designs . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Yeah okay . "
B,Task,"I think that would be a good idea . "
D,Other,"Perfect . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"anyone uh any questions for now ? "
C,Task,"No no . I don't have . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"is this "
A,Elicit,"is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ? "
B,Task,"Um yes "
B,Other,"I come to that uh uh "
C,Task,"Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices comm if you're using speech recognition or something like that . "
B,Minor,"Yes well "
B,Minor,"m maybe "
B,Task,"uh comm I don't know whether that's possible comm "
B,Task,"maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Okay "
A,Minor,"well "
A,Elicit,"is this me designing a way to evaluate it "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Elicit,"Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ? "
B,Task,"I don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"but a as far as possible . "
A,Task,"Okay . Yep . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
C,Task,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email . "
D,Elicit,"Two or three prototypes ? "
C,Task,"Two . "
B,Task,"Two . "
D,Other,"Two ? "
C,Task,"One for like cost and the one with like higher-end "
B,Minor,"I "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm and then "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"so that then we can be easily comparing them "
D,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"or you know find a compromise between both of them comm "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"and find maybe a compromise . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Yes okay . "
C,Task,"yeah that's how it is . "
D,Task,"Perfect yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Okay "
B,Task,"let's call this to an end . "
A,Task,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Thanks guys . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we are done for now . . "
