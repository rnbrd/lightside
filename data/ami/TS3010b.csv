A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So welcome back . "
A,Elicit,"What do do we have to do ? "
D,Minor,". "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"first . I want to say I'm the secretary comm "
A,Task,"so I make the minutes . "
A,Task,"You find them in your in the map in the From the group . "
A,Task,"There's the minutes from the first meeting . "
A,Task,"You'll find the next minutes also there . "
A,Minor,"Then "
A,Task,"I wanna hear from you comm what you've done . "
A,Task,"And after that I have some new product requirements . So "
A,Task,"And after that we have to make decisions comm what we will do . "
A,Task,"And then we're ready . "
A,Task,"We have forty minutes for this meeting . "
A,Task,"After that we'll have lunch . "
A,Elicit,"So first I wanna ask the Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So "
C,Other,"That's my task . Okay . "
C,Minor,"Uh I've "
C,Elicit,"Where have I put it ? "
C,Task,"My Documents or not ? "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"I've save it on my computer comm my presentation . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah on your computer comm or the "
C,Elicit,"But where ? "
A,Elicit,"What's the name ? "
C,Minor,"Uh uh uh "
A,Elicit,"What's the name of it ? "
C,Task,"It was about the working of the remote control . "
A,Task,"It's the technical function or the functional requirements . "
C,Task,"Nope . "
C,Minor,"Not a of "
C,Minor,"Wait . "
C,Task,"The working design . "
C,Task,"But I've saved it . "
A,Task,"Working design . "
C,Task,"But now I don't know where it is . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Working design . "
A,Elicit,"What is this ? "
A,Task,"Product documents . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"And I import this until "
A,Task,"On the desktop . "
A,Task,"Up . "
A,Task,"up . "
C,Task,"One more . "
A,Task,"Up . Up . "
A,Task,"Up . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"My Documents . "
A,Minor,"Nope . "
C,Task,"What the fuck is this ? "
A,Task,"Gone . "
A,Minor,"Well you Um Nah . Nah comm nah comm nah . "
A,Task,"PowerPoint . Working design . "
C,Task,"Yeah that's the empty one . "
A,Minor,"And "
C,Task,"I had one . "
A,Task,"Presentation of working design . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"Open it . "
C,Task,"Okay here it is . "
A,Task,"Save as . "
A,Minor,"Uh it's "
D,Task,"Desktop . "
A,Task,"Project . "
C,Task,"Project . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Okay . Well . "
A,Minor,"Save . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Very good . "
C,Task,"A little later but here it is . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"So okay . "
C,Task,"It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . "
C,Task,"It's about the working of the remote control . "
C,Task,"I just had an half an hour j to study it "
C,Task,"and I don't get it . "
D,Minor,"Make it . "
A,Task,"Now have ten minutes to tell it . "
C,Other,"Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . "
C,Task,"I think it will be a few minutes and "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"First uh I will tell you something about the findings comm "
C,Task,"what I discovered about the remote control . "
C,Task,"The working bout it uh of it . "
C,Task,"Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map comm "
C,Task,"and it's the top of the remote control . "
C,Task,"With a little bit of science comm "
C,Minor,"uh you "
C,Task,"I will show that uh in in a few minutes . "
C,Task,"And then uh what I'll think about it . "
C,Other,"First comm the findings . "
C,Task,"The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . "
C,Task,"Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it comm "
C,Task,"um because its uh not so expensive . "
C,Task,"And there are uh a lot of uh wires comm "
C,Task,"uh which um connect the components in it comm "
C,Task,"the battery comm "
C,Task,"and there are um switches and things like that . "
C,Task,"There's a lot of small uh electronics . "
C,Task,"So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . "
C,Task,"Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . "
C,Minor,"Now "
C,Task,"And here I have the top of the remote control . "
C,Task,"Uh here's some kind of chip . "
C,Task,"Uh on top of this comm there are uh the numbers . "
C,Task,"Uh you have all on your remote control . "
C,Task,"And uh the teletext uh button . "
C,Task,"And uh here's the battery . "
C,Task,"And when you push the button comm it will uh will be sent to the chip . "
C,Task,"And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . "
C,Task,"That's what I said comm it's very difficult . "
C,Task,"And after that it will be sent to the infrared . "
C,Task,"And that will send it to your television . "
C,Task,"That's a short h uh how it works . "
C,Task,"Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult comm "
C,Task,"but we all we all don't get it . "
C,Other,"My preferences ? "
C,Minor,"It's uh it won't be uh "
C,Task,"We shouldn't make it too big . "
C,Task,"Uh also for the cost comm uh we should only put one battery on it . "
C,Task,"A long-lasting battery . "
C,Task,"Uh also for the cost comm uh use only plastic . "
C,Task,"Not other materials . "
C,Task,"Also because of the cost comm uh not too much buttons on it . "
C,Task,"We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button . "
C,Task,"And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . "
C,Task,"And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . "
C,Task,"That's I think it's easier . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And the bleep signal comm y uh you told us . "
C,Task,"Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something comm when the battery's empty comm then there is a bleep . "
C,Task,"Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . "
C,Task,"And also the bleep comm when what I told you about uh when you lost it comm "
C,Task,"and you push a button comm and then you hear bleep bleep comm and we will find it . "
C,Minor,"This is uh just uh "
A,Other,"Oh oh . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Two questions . "
A,Task,"The battery . "
A,Task,"You say one battery is cheaper . "
A,Elicit,"Why ? "
C,Task,"If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light comm then it will be cheaper than when we use two . "
A,Task,"Yeah but "
A,Task,"when you use two comm you can use it two times longer . "
C,Task,"Yeah but "
C,Task,"then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . "
A,Task,"Okay so it's the size of the remote control . "
C,Minor,"Just "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay and the buttons . "
A,Task,"When you use it on the television comm you've you need the television comm wh which can use it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But uh I think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Or is it also for other company uh for other televisions ? "
A,Task,"I think we have to use it also on other televisions though . "
C,Task,"Then this is an option . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . "
C,Task,"And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . "
C,Task,"And on the other tele televisions comm you can also use it comm "
C,Minor,"but then we won't use the "
A,Minor,"Yeah but I don't I think it "
A,Task,"They are two different things though . "
A,Task,"We have to choose one . "
A,Task,"It has to work on o uh all televisions . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah ? Okay . "
C,Task,"Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . "
C,Task,"And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And I just uh have one more idea . "
C,Task,"Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . "
C,Task,"But Uh comm to have a trendy remote control comm we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . "
C,Task,"So if you have uh a trendy half with all red comm uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"And also different things . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Good idea . "
D,Elicit,"Will this will this add to the cost ? "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Uh then it won't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . "
C,Task,"And then you can buy the covers . "
D,Task,"Yes "
D,Task,"but you have to m uh be able to change it . "
D,Elicit,"D does it make it more difficult to design ? "
C,Task,"I think it will be a little more difficult comm "
C,Task,"but not too much . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Not much . 'Kay . "
C,Task,"Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . "
A,Task,"Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones . "
C,Task,"Just one . "
C,Task,"Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it comm and see if it works . "
C,Task,"If it won't works then we'll get something else . "
C,Task,"Then we uh won't g uh go further with it . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ? "
C,Task,"Uh a p a a cover made in uh in China comm it it won't be I guess so expensive I think . "
A,Task,"Yeah but there are also design cost . "
A,Minor,"I don't think "
A,Elicit,"When you have a remote control comm do you change the cover ? "
C,Task,"Maybe . "
A,Elicit,"Would you change the cover ? "
C,Task,"I wi I won't . "
C,Task,"But maybe I think trendy people "
A,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"or like children where you can paint on it comm "
C,Task,"and uh the the children think comm oh this is my remote control comm uh I made a picture on it . Uh "
A,Minor,"N yeah but "
A,Task,"I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"And the other people ? What do you think about it ? "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Yeah it's a good idea . But "
B,Minor,"If if it Yeah comm I don't "
B,Task,"I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea . "
A,Task,"Yes it is "
A,Task,"but I don't think we have to do it . "
B,Minor,"No . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"You're the Project Manager . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yes . That's it . "
A,Other,"That's clear . "
A,Other,"Okay thank you . "
A,Task,"So now the User Interface Designer . "
B,Task,"Oh . That's me . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
B,Other,"Come on . . "
B,Minor,"Ah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . "
B,Task,"Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . "
B,Task,"Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . "
B,Task,"No cords attached . "
B,Task,"And uh well comm it all by pushing a button on the remote . "
B,Task,"That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . "
B,Task,"Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . "
B,Task,"Uh well the same idea here . "
B,Task,"Uh message to the television . "
B,Task,"And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off comm and uh switching channels comm and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"well these are two uh remotes comm "
B,Task,"and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh "
B,Task,"We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . "
B,Task,"But uh shall we make a basic remote control comm uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . "
B,Task,"Or uh uh more functions on the remote . "
B,Task,"Uh maybe more devices you can influence . "
B,Task,"Uh a radio or a v a video recorder comm uh V_C_R_ . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"well that's our dilemma . "
B,Elicit,"Um any ideas about that ? "
B,Elicit,"Basic or multifunctional ? "
A,Task,"We'll got back on that later . "
B,Other,"Okay yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah well the that was just on my mind . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go . "
B,Task,"Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Other,"'Kay comm thank you . "
A,Task,"Then it's your turn comm the marketing expert . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Uh um m "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um yeah okay . "
D,Task,"This bit too far . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market comm "
D,Task,"about um yeah what people think . "
D,Task,"Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . "
D,Task,"And we looked at uh several um things . "
D,Task,"Uh among them design comm "
D,Task,"uh d d how d did they like the use of it comm "
D,Task,"uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . "
D,Task,"Uh well what what will be our market . "
D,Task,"And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . "
D,Task,"Well our findings . "
D,Task,"Uh our users comm they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . "
D,Task,"Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . "
D,Task,"And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . "
D,Task,"Uh well they also zap a lot . "
D,Task,"So uh zapping uh should be very easy . "
D,Task,"And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . "
D,Task,"So a lot of unused buttons . "
D,Task,"There is more findings . "
D,Task,"Uh on the buttons . "
D,Task,"Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? "
D,Task,"And how much would they use them ? "
D,Task,"Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . "
D,Task,"And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . "
D,Task,"The power comm volume and channel selections are very relevant . "
D,Task,"Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . "
D,Task,"Uh not important they found the audio comm "
D,Task,"uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch comm or the left or right . "
D,Task,"Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . "
D,Task,"Then we have a few um graphs about the market . "
D,Task,"Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . "
D,Task,"Um as you can see comm most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . "
D,Task,"Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . "
D,Task,"And to come back on the the swapping uh things comm uh I don't think uh comm I I think the younger will be most interest in it . "
D,Task,"But uh they are not a very big group . "
D,Task,"Um in the we asked them comm uh how would you like a s a new feature . "
D,Task,"If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control comm what would you think of it . "
D,Task,"Now you can clearly see young users say . I will that would very nice . "
D,Task,"And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think . "
D,Task,"And they won't like it . "
D,Task,"And another thing comm how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . "
D,Task,"Well here we see the same . "
D,Task,"Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . "
D,Task,"And old users not . "
D,Task,"Uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim . "
D,Task,"Uh the first are the younger comm "
D,Task,"the age between sixteen and forty five . "
D,Task,"Uh they are highly interested in the features comm as you can see uh here . "
D,Task,"And um they are more critical on their money spending . "
D,Task,"Uh the second group is the older group . "
D,Task,"Aged between forty six and sixty five . "
D,Task,"They are less interested in uh new features . "
D,Task,"But uh they spend their money more easily . "
D,Task,"Now if we look back at this graph comm we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . "
D,Task,"And the second group about forty percent . "
D,Task,"So the the first group is bigger . "
D,Task,"Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . "
D,Task,"Uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . "
D,Task,"Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . "
D,Task,"But less of them will buy it . "
D,Minor,"Um well I uh "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"What I thought comm um even young people say it's hard to use comm remote control . "
D,Task,"So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use comm that's especially aimed at this group comm even uh the young group will also be more interested . "
D,Task,"And um we can make special features . "
D,Task,"But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . "
D,Task,"But when use it comm uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um well th uh that's my second point . "
D,Task,"Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . "
D,Task,"It's about discussion we had earlier . Um "
D,Task,"You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . "
D,Task,"So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options comm or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . "
D,Task,"Um well the design is very important . "
D,Task,"One thing I did not say I think comm is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . "
D,Task,"But they found most remote controls very ugly . "
D,Task,"So the design of our remote control is very important . "
D,Task,"And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly comm "
D,Task,"as most users use it for that . "
D,Task,"That were my findings . "
A,Other,"Okay thank you . "
C,Task,"Yeah . I have uh one question . "
C,Task,"If we aim for the younger people comm um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising comm uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh I think we don't have that in our budget . "
B,Minor,"No . "
C,Elicit,"Do you think ? "
D,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . "
C,Minor,"Like "
C,Task,"No . No . "
B,Task,"So it's Yeah comm it's hard to uh get the younger group . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . "
A,Task,"So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Just the L_C_D_ ? "
A,Task,"Yes . Only the L_C_D_ . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"But we'll come back on that . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Now "
A,Other,"Oh comm go on . "
A,Minor,"What d d d um "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Uh we go back on the decisions later . "
A,Task,"Now we have a few new product requirements . "
A,Task,"First comm teletext . "
A,Task,"We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . "
A,Task,"So not necessary . "
A,Task,"Next . "
A,Task,"Only for the television . "
A,Task,"So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . "
A,Task,"Only the television . "
A,Task,"We look at the age group of forty plus . "
A,Task,"Uh no comm younger than forty . "
A,Task,"Is a g big group comm "
A,Task,"and like you showed comm n not very much people buy our stuff . "
A,Task,"Fourth point . "
A,Task,"Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . "
A,Task,"Very important for the design . "
A,Task,"So you can see it on our site . "
A,Task,"Next . "
A,Other,"Um no . "
A,Task,"We have to make our decisions comm what we want to do . "
A,Minor,"So like you said comm we need the . "
A,Task,"Maybe it's good to put it in a document . "
A,Task,"Now we have to decide what controls do we need . "
A,Elicit,"So maybe you can tell us . "
D,Task,"Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said . "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
D,Task,"The the requirements you just said comm "
A,Other,"Yes . "
D,Task,"maybe we should first have a discussion about that . "
A,Task,"Yes comm it's okay . "
D,Task,"I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . "
D,Task,"Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . "
A,Task,"Yeah but we don't use it . "
A,Task,"It's a new requirement . "
A,Task,"So comm it's not my requirement . "
C,Task,"'Kay comm we'll just have to do that . "
A,Task,"We have to do this . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Okay . Okay sorry . "
C,Task,"No discussion about it . "
D,Minor,"Then uh "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Unfortunately . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"what controls do we need ? "
A,Elicit,"Who first ? "
B,Task,"Well a power button ? "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh power . "
B,Task,"Uh the well um I think separate channels . So "
A,Other,"Uh mm channel . "
B,Task,"But then both the the separate channels . "
B,Task,"So so uh zero to nine or something . "
A,Minor,"Channel "
A,Other,"Zero to nine . "
B,Task,"Uh volume . "
A,Minor,"Volume . "
A,Task,"Maybe it's easy to pick . "
A,Elicit,"What was w your one ? "
A,Minor,"Techno "
D,Other,"Mine ? "
D,Task,"It's the functional requirements . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"We had w "
A,Task,"uh no no no no . "
A,Elicit,"Where was that example of the "
B,Task,"Oh mine . "
A,Task,"Johan . "
A,Elicit,"That was the the the the the "
B,Task,"Technical . "
A,Task,"technical "
A,Other,"Hallo . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"What do we need ? "
A,Task,"On-off . "
A,Task,"Zero to nine . "
C,Task,"To change to the next channel comm just one button . "
C,Task,"To move up comm move down . "
A,Task,"Yeah that's the channel . "
D,Minor,"D Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Do we make a menu ? "
A,Other,"Menu ? "
A,Task,"Uh yes "
A,Task,"the n newer televisions ha do have menus . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Other,"M Menu . "
A,Task,"I think um the only one or two numbers . "
B,Task,"Mm yes . "
A,Minor,"And "
A,Other,"Hello ? "
A,Minor,"That's ch "
D,Task,"I think it will be um q quite easy to use comm to have uh uh four arrows . "
D,Task,"Up-down for channel selection comm "
D,Task,"and left-right uh for volume . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"And uh a menu uh button . "
D,Task,"And if you press the menu button you get into the menu comm "
D,Task,"and you can use the same buttons . "
D,Task,"But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . "
A,Elicit,"On the L_C_D_ screen comm you mean ? "
D,Task,"Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control . "
A,Task,"Think it's better to have it on the remote control comm "
A,Task,"'cause it it has to work on all televisions . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"But then we come to the costs . "
A,Minor,"we need "
A,Task,"N Yes . "
A,Minor,"But if we have this "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"But well if you aim at the younger market comm um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab comm uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . "
D,Task,"And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . "
D,Task,"So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen comm and uh not too many buttons comm I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost comm it will still sell . "
A,Task,"So now we don't have a lot of buttons . "
A,Elicit,"Is this enough ? "
B,Task,"Mute . "
A,Task,"Mute . "
A,Task,"Maybe in the menu ? "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do . "
A,Minor,"Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Maybe more ? "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Well . Then that's all . "
A,Task,"This will be the buttons . "
A,Minor,"And "
A,Task,"I think that's enough for the next phase . "
A,Minor,"So we can go on to "
C,Task,"But now we have only the buttons . "
C,Elicit,"And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"that's for the next phase . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Phase two is the conceptual design . "
A,Task,"So then we'll have the concepts . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"That's for the "
