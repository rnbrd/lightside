A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Hi Team . "
A,Other,"Hope you had a good lunch . "
A,Task,"Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting . "
A,Task,"Um let's get started . "
A,Task,"'Kay comm here is the agenda for today's meeting . "
A,Task,"Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager . "
A,Task,"We're gonna have three presentations comm "
A,Task,"one from each of you again . "
A,Task,"And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts "
A,Task,"and then we're gonna close it up . "
A,Task,"And we have forty minutes again . "
A,Task,"'Kay comm and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . "
A,Elicit,"Who would like to go first ? "
B,Task,"Just trying to move mine right now . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um Courtney would you mind starting us off ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Trend watching ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"Okay comm so trend watching . "
D,Task,"Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics comm it is kind of important how our product looks . "
D,Task,"So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next . "
D,Task,"So what they want . "
D,Task,"Right now customers want fancy versus functional . "
D,Minor,"Um basically about fifty eight percent of what they "
D,Task,"like of the product that they want comm describing like the in order of how much they want comm "
D,Task,"fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like comm fancy versus functional comm "
D,Task,"and then it has to also be technologically innovative comm and yet easy to use . "
D,Task,"So the customer basically is confused . "
D,Task,"They don't know exactly what they want . "
D,Task,"They want us to tell them . "
B,Task,"They want everything comm but simply . "
D,Task,"Yes . Exactly . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So we can go to next . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing comm shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . "
D,Task,"So I don't know if we want to go with that "
D,Task,"um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . "
D,Task,"I don't know really comm "
D,Task,"I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to "
A,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
D,Task,"rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff comm you'd want like a softer touch . "
D,Elicit,"I mean do you guys know what I mean . "
A,Other,"Right . Yes . "
B,Other,"Yeah th "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns comm I don't know if we really want to go with that comm "
D,Task,"because it is just a trend comm "
D,Task,"and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months comm "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Right . "
D,Minor,"because "
A,Task,"People don't buy a new remote every so often . "
B,Minor,"I I can "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now . "
B,Other,"I can address some of that issue comm I think comm with uh my presentation . "
D,Task,"Okay . Awesome . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Um so design preferences comm "
D,Task,"um we need easy to read like large buttons comm clearly labelled "
D,Task,"so that comm I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . "
D,Task,"Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch comm "
D,Task,"you said that in your design comm "
D,Task,"with the bulb . "
D,Task,"Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . "
D,Task,"Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . "
D,Task,"That's one of our key goals comm we wanna promote our product . "
D,Task,"And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something . "
D,Task,"Actually right here . "
D,Task,"So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone "
D,Task,"like this comm "
D,Task,"where we put the buttons around comm like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle comm "
D,Task,"I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down comm "
D,Task,"and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . "
D,Task,"'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation "
D,Task,"and like said retro's cool . "
D,Task,"So it's classically retro . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Elicit,"So I mean that's just an idea if you guys like it . "
A,Task,"Very good . I like it . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm ready for the next slide ? "
D,Minor,"And comm "
D,Task,"yep . "
D,Task,"And that's it . "
A,Task,"Op mm 'kay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Great . Great presentation . "
A,Elicit,"Ready ? "
C,Task,"Okay "
C,Other,"hang on . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
C,Other,"See if it's there . "
A,Elicit,"Which one is it ? "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
C,Other,"Hang on . "
C,Task,"Interface concepts comm "
C,Elicit,"no ? "
A,Other,"Interface concepts new . "
C,Task,"Either refresh it comm "
C,Minor,"or it sh "
C,Other,"Oh wait comm "
A,Minor,"Y "
C,Task,"maybe I didn't put it there . "
C,Other,"Hang on . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"Mine will always read copy of something or other . "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
B,Task,"I I copied mine before I sent it over . "
A,Task,"Oh okay . "
C,Other,"Sorry comm "
C,Other,"hang on . "
C,Other,"Don't know . "
A,Other,"Oh there we go . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm um "
C,Task,"looking at the interface concept comm it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . "
C,Task,"Uh if you wanna start the next slide . "
A,Task,"Sure . "
C,Task,"Um uh can't really see comm but there's two possible ways comm "
C,Task,"on the r left comm if you see on th on the sides of of the remote comm you have the sort of scroll down comm "
C,Task,"so you have that option right there . "
C,Task,"And then also there's the idea of the base . "
C,Task,"That's sort of like an idea there . "
C,Task,"And then on the right comm we have what's really big trend right now comm it's the iPod . "
C,Task,"It's becoming really "
C,Task,"and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons comm "
C,Task,"and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip comm but also very sleek and um and very simple comm but technologically advanced . "
C,Task,"So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control "
C,Task,"then sort of look into it comm "
C,Task,"but Anyway comm next . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Task,"Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . "
C,Task,"You'd you know you're in the dark comm you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . "
C,Task,"And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ comm "
C,Task,"and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . "
C,Task,"What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down comm because the down arrow . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up . "
C,Task,"Um but then you have you could either do it by raised type comm "
C,Task,"which could be you know comm iffy comm "
C,Task,"um sort of old-fashioned in a way . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Either that or just have it by shape comm "
C,Task,"for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . "
C,Task,"And then the round ones you sort of feel by comm you know comm that's the second one down comm that sort of thing . "
C,Task,"So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . "
C,Task,"Um this is particularly geared towards children . "
D,Task,"That's cute . "
C,Task,"Um it's very cute comm "
C,Task,"and we could probably change it to yellow comm bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . "
C,Task,"Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . "
C,Task,"Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain "
C,Task,"channels that only these children would watch comm "
C,Task,"so it's like they ch watch comm you know comm the C_ Beebies or something like that comm "
C,Task,"uh keep them away from other channels . "
C,Minor,"So that's like another ar Um comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I mean comm these are three examples sort of looking at it . "
C,Task,"You have the wider section for the main controls there . "
C,Task,"Uh you could see how many buttons there are . "
C,Task,"And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons comm and a simpler design . "
C,Task,"On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that comm "
C,Task,"because it's more for like a D_V_D_ function which we are not gonna be using . Um . "
C,Task,"So again it's sort of like just give you ideas "
C,Task,"and then down at the bottom you have the logos "
C,Task,"and that's where you could put the R_R_ comm Real Reaction . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"And then finally these are like the sort of same examples comm "
C,Task,"but also some more comm just possibilities that we could go with . "
C,Task,"None of them I'm particularly keen on by the way . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying comm well out of this one we like comm you know the round section of um comm b or we'd like the the button size on this . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Or I like comm you know comm the black finish or the silver finish or whatever . "
C,Task,"Right . "
D,Task,"I have four of those remotes . "
A,Other,"Good lord . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . Ready ? "
C,Task,"That's it . "
A,Task,"Oh comm yeah . Okay . "
A,Task,"Great job . "
B,Other,"Okay comm my turn . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Whoo . "
A,Elicit,"What's the title ? "
B,Task,"It'll be copy of component design . "
A,Task,"Got it . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Th that looks like it . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"So basic remote operation runs as follows comm "
B,Task,"press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit comm "
B,Task,"chip senses the connection comm "
B,Task,"chip produces a morse code infra-red signal comm specific to that button . "
B,Task,"So you press the button comm it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . "
B,Task,"Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre comm which interprets the signal response accordingly comm changes channel etcetera . "
B,Other,"So that being said "
B,Task,"Next slide comm please . "
B,Task,"Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction comm "
B,Task,"so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed comm "
B,Elicit,"we need rubber for buttons comm aluminium for battery y contacts comm integrated circuit which consists of a diode comm transistor comm resonator comm resistors comm and a capacitator comm "
B,Task,"all those basic things that make a circuit function . "
B,Task,"Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . "
B,Task,"An L_E_D_ comm which is a light emitting diode comm "
B,Task,"um contact discs for the buttons comm plastic for the casing comm and a power-source comm "
B,Task,"whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . "
B,Task,"Next slide comm please . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Task,"Uh personal preferences comm "
B,Task,"uh to save money for the components comm the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . "
B,Task,"Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips comm casing comm L_E_D_ comm any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing comm we should go for it . "
B,Task,"Next slide comm please . "
B,Task,"Um just talking to the um manufacturing division . "
B,Task,"They suggested power options comm solar cells comm hand dynamo comm and kinetic power comm "
B,Task,"so you shake it and it increases the power . "
B,Task,"Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works comm "
B,Task,"they have yet to get back to me on that . "
B,Task,"So next slide comm please . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Interesting . "
B,Task,"Suggested casing options . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"We can offer options for casing such as straight comm curved comm double-curved comm you know comm "
B,Task,"very specific to the customer . "
B,Task,"Options for materials comm plastic comm rubber comm titanium comm wood . "
B,Task,"I don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one comm because splinters "
D,Task,"That would be amazing comm though comm yeah . "
D,Task,"No comm splinters would "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um certain restrictions do apply here though . "
B,Task,"Uh latex comm you can't do solar power with a latex one . "
B,Task,"So comm if they want some a soft squishy rubber comm they can't have the solar powered option . "
B,Task,"Double-curved comm you can't do titanium . "
D,Elicit,"What is that ? "
B,Task,"Um that would be two curvatures comm "
B,Task,"so it would actually comm if you the shape of your hand comm you curve here and you curve here comm so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Now if you wanted that comm you can't do titanium . "
B,Task,"And uh so you functions what for the buttons comm scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"I think I have one more slide . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"No comm I didn't . "
A,Task,"No comm okay . "
B,Task,"Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips "
B,Task,"and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip comm which we could utilise . "
B,Task,"Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . "
B,Task,"So depends on what we decide we wanna do . "
B,Task,"In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote comm we're going to have to have multiples of each type comm "
B,Task,"like a double-curved in rubber comm um you know comm each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . "
B,Task,"So we'll have to mix it up comm make sure we produce enough of everyone . "
B,Task,"But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand comm you know comm double-curved wooden remotes . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"And that's all I got . "
A,Task,"Okay . Alright comm "
A,Task,"well thank you for those informative presentations . "
A,Minor,"Let's go back to um "
A,Task,"Now we have to make some decisions . "
A,Other,"Where were we ? "
C,Other,"Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before comm "
A,Task,"Sure . "
C,Task,"and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"Oh this the thing we were talking about earlier . "
C,Task,"Right "
C,Task,"except that it's sort of odd comm "
C,Task,"and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are comm "
C,Task,"um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for "
C,Task,"So comm you would say like comm good morning comm coffeemaker comm and it would respond comm good morning comm Jill comm "
C,Task,"but "
C,Task,"I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work comm 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions . "
C,Elicit,"So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question comm and can't change it in order for it to be recognised comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"or can it be altered in a certain way comm "
C,Elicit,"or does the actually user program it comm to say a channel means this . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"like using the menu to be like comm enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"So that way the remote reads it . "
C,Task,"Right comm "
C,Task,"so it's got like a limited memory and programme it . "
C,Task,"So it's sort of iffy comm "
C,Task,"but that's kind of what you'd say . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I feel like voice recognition would be comm I don't know comm w it would be too hard to really "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Programme . "
D,Task,"I mean we could do it comm but "
A,Task,"If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would comm you know comm technology "
D,Minor,"Technology . "
B,Task,"Well comm we are making the chip . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"So comm I mean "
B,Task,"But comm I guess comm we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . "
D,Task,"And it is a growing trend comm the higher technological comm like "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"the comm I mean just like the more advanced it is comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"the better it'll sell . "
B,Task,"I I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different comm you know "
B,Task,"I think we'd have to decide on the power options comm maybe . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"So that we could reduce cost . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm that kind of brings us to this comm "
A,Task,"let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . Um . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ? "
D,Task,"Oh the base comm yeah . "
A,Task,"The base comm the charging base with rechargeable batteries ? "
B,Minor,"I think the p "
C,Task,"I always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like comm before "
C,Task,"'Cause if it's something really really small comm then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it comm "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"W "
A,Task,"and we don't have multiple things that it has to control comm it just has to control the T_V_ . "
A,Task,"It's not gonna be a huge universal remote . "
D,Task,"We need to decide comm well so we can figure how big it's gonna be comm like exactly what buttons we want "
C,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"What size battery and "
D,Minor,"and exactly "
C,Task,"Well comm the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons comm so we want it to be bigger than this comm "
D,Task,"It could be like this . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"I'd comm well uh "
C,Task,"'cause it still fits in your hand comm so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial comm but not necessarily full of buttons . "
D,Task,"This one is really comfortable comm "
D,Task,"like I like the sides whatever comm "
C,Task,"Are you gonna lose it easier ? "
D,Minor,"because "
D,Task,"But if we have the um comm the locator comm then we don't have to worry about that . "
B,Task,"That's true . "
D,Task,"So we can make it small if we have a l locating device . "
B,Task,"If we do a voice-activated locator comm though comm we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Other,"So i That's the other thing comm "
C,Minor,"it's like You know "
C,Elicit,"Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period ? "
D,Task,"Two double A_s comm for this size . "
C,Task,"But like comm you know comm if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Honestly comm I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base "
B,Task,"if we did do a nice small comm compact "
A,Task,"Right . I agree comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just "
C,Minor,"So we sh "
D,Minor,"Smaller comm without "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"A battery like this guy . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Alright comm so what direction do you want to go in ? "
A,Elicit,"You wanna vote ? "
D,Task,"I think if we had a a locating device with the small one comm I think that seems way more advanced . "
A,Task,"I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I'm a away from the base . "
A,Task,"bigger and the base . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"'Kay so "
A,Task,"That just seems so clunky and "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now comm those trends the smaller the hotter it is comm "
C,Task,"Smaller and smaller comm yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Other,"You're kidding . "
B,Task,"You know it happens . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I've had three watches go that way too . "
C,Task,"Oh watches I've but I've never washed a cell phone . "
D,Other,"Ouch . "
D,Task,"A phone comm whoa comm that would wow comm that would hurt . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ? "
B,Task,"Pieces everywhere . "
B,Task,"Well comm we have lots of options . "
B,Task,"I don't think wood is a viable option . "
D,Task,"Yeah wood . "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"Well comm titanium s "
A,Minor,"Oh what did you "
A,Other,"Oh sorry comm "
A,Task,"go ahead . "
C,Task,"I was saying that titanium comm if we're being restricted then I would probably lean away from that . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip comm titanium will be more expensive . "
A,Task,"Right . "
B,Other,"However comm "
A,Elicit,"What would you recommend ? "
B,Task,"well comm we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium comm "
C,Minor,"That'll "
C,Task,"Yeah comm exactly . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"make them a rarity so to speak . "
C,Task,"The selling point comm yeah . "
D,Task,"We could do that comm "
D,Task,"because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if "
C,Elicit,"Are we restricted by this ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well the original "
A,Task,"I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm "
C,Task,"Twenty five Euros "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of "
A,Task,"remotes . "
A,Task,"If this was a successful remote comm we might then produce a higher end version of it comm I think . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Good plan . "
D,Task,"Good plan . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm so we wanna go for plastic comm "
A,Elicit,"or what would you recommend for materials ? "
B,Minor,"Honestly I'd recommend like um "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power comm I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex comm "
B,Task,"because we could produce comm you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . "
B,Task,"We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so comm "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"because this year is all fruit comm "
B,Task,"God only knows why comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm who knows . "
B,Task,"um we could do f a cherry cover for this year "
B,Task,"and then i if next year is stripes or solids comm you know "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"So you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured "
C,Elicit,"or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ? "
D,Task,"O or we could like take off this . "
A,Task,"They could buy cases comm maybe comm "
B,Task,"They could come back . And buy the extra case . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"if they wanted . "
A,Task,"I think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options . "
B,Task,"So we could do like a b a hard base plastic comm and then we could give two latex covers to start . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"The "
C,Task,"what the top face comm right ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"because the soft latex definitely is squishy . "
D,Task,"That's in . "
D,Task,"Well I mean squishier than like comm yeah comm just a hard plastic . "
A,Minor,"Right . Right . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ? "
B,Minor,"How complicated "
B,Elicit,"Are we gonna go with the voice activated "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I don't think we should do voice comm "
A,Task,"I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost comm you know . "
C,Elicit,"A tracker comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"could we "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"'Cause that uh what it type of comm yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like comm "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time . "
A,Task,"Right . "
D,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"Well comm we could give it a specific code comm you know comm remote missing . "
D,Task,"Ooh . "
D,Task,"Uh see I'm uh I'm strangely attracted to it comm "
D,Task,"because I know that's it's definitely gonna be big comm "
D,Task,"because it's comm I don't know comm it's just so high-tech . "
C,Task,"Well comm my little sister got for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring comm and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm see that would just irritate me . "
C,Task,"And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse comm and you couldn't turn it off . "
A,Task,"Oh dear . "
D,Other,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"So it became highly irritating . "
D,Minor,"then maybe voice "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"maybe voice activation won't be good . "
B,Task,"So I think having a key-phrase is much better . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Alright . But it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say comm channel up comm and it would work comm "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm n n no comm we just want it to be a finder . "
C,Minor,"But then it "
A,Minor,"Just a "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Okay comm alright . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"But do can your "
D,Elicit,"can the department make "
B,Task,"That would be like a mid-class um Yeah . "
D,Task,"Oh comm brilliant then . "
B,Minor,"So we don't actually have to go for "
B,Task,"Well comm if they've just developed the sample sensor comm sample speaker comm it's a brand new chip . "
B,Task,"Why not introduce it in this way ? "
A,Minor,"No . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm good point . "
A,Task,"Mm 'kay . "
A,Elicit,"Uh and what size batteries comm double A_ comm triple A_ ? "
D,Task,"I think triple A_ comm it'll be lighter . "
A,Task,"Two ? "
A,Elicit,"Could it run off of two "
D,Task,"I mean more more come in a package . "
C,Task,"Well comm that depends on what the energy is needed . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think comm well comm we could d r do two "
B,Task,"or we could do one small lithium comm "
B,Task,"'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products comm right ? "
B,Task,"So they're more widely available now . "
B,Task,"And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries . "
A,Task,"They're more expensive though comm too . "
B,Task,"But if you only have to replace it every five years . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"That's a good point . "
A,Elicit,"Thoughts anybody ? "
C,Task,"As long as we sell it with it . "
B,Task,"Well comm how about a initial comm you get one battery when you buy it comm "
B,Task,"'cause I'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk . "
C,Task,"Right comm that's what I meant . "
D,Task,"We could think about it and come back to it next meeting . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Alright . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"We still have one more meeting . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So we've covered that first category comm "
A,Task,"User Interface Concept comm "
A,Elicit,"meaning design . "
C,Minor,"What's it gonna "
C,Task,"Yeah comm what's it gonna look like . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial comm "
A,Task,"and that the central button could have comm maybe our logo on it ? "
A,Task,"It might be the four way scroll comm too . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it could be whatever comm "
A,Minor,"I mean if "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"as long as there's something big in the middle comm "
D,Task,"because like the old phones comm there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Well comm my issue with that is if it got too big though comm "
C,Elicit,"'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle comm then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Oh comm that's true . "
C,Elicit,"because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ? "
D,Task,"Good point . "
B,Task,"In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side comm "
A,Other,"Oh comm I see what you mean . "
B,Task,"that could be particularly useful . "
A,Task,"I think so . "
D,Task,"So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I like that . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"But we definitely "
D,Task,"If we have scroll things on the side comm we definitely have to have 'em labelled . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"like on the side of it . "
B,Task,"Well comm if it's just up and down "
D,Other,"Oh if it's just up and down . "
C,Elicit,"But is that for "
B,Elicit,"Volume or channel . "
C,Elicit,"Which ? "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"Well comm you could do some on both sides . "
C,Elicit,"Do we have both sides ? "
A,Elicit,"Can we ? "
B,Task,"Mm yeah . "
B,Task,"We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan "
B,Task,"'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this comm you know . "
D,Task,"That's squishy . That's squishy . "
C,Task,"Well comm the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side . "
D,Task,"have buttons . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Elicit,"'Kay any other ideas ? "
C,Elicit,"Um what colour ? "
A,Other,"Oh comm yeah . Latex covers . W "
B,Task,"We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on comm "
B,Task,"so we'll have to like have a little square or something comm so that the our logo's available . "
C,Task,"Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And that's at the bottom of it . "
A,Task,"I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though comm "
A,Task,"because if people are able to change the covers comm "
C,Elicit,"Which button ? "
A,Task,"I don't know comm "
A,Task,"maybe the on-off button comm something comm some the menu button comm "
A,Task,"I don't know comm "
A,Task,"but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get "
A,Task,"another one . "
A,Elicit,"Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ? "
A,Elicit,"Every cover ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I don't think we should do that comm because that would just be icky . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea . "
A,Task,"If we want it to be visible and "
A,Elicit,"Um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But those are plastic comm right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"They're not titanium . "
A,Task,"I kind of like that look . "
A,Minor,"Uh but comm or if it was really "
B,Elicit,"For our base one ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm for the base "
A,Task,"or if we're going for the retro look comm I think comm like a really shiny black would be cool . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"What are your thoughts ? "
D,Task,"or like a gun-metal grey comm "
A,Other,"Gun-metal gray . "
D,Task,"'cause then it combines the silver and the black . "
A,Task,"There you go comm gun-metal gray . "
C,Task,"I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button . "
A,Elicit,"Why ? "
B,Task,"It'll wear off . "
C,Minor,"What's the button "
D,Task,"Yeah comm buttons wear off . "
C,Elicit,"Well comm w w then what's the button do comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"and how do you know that that is what the button does ? "
C,Task,"I guess . Just looking at examples comm y you just don't ever see the logo on a button comm it's always on the actual casing . "
A,Task,"Right . "
D,Task,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual "
D,Task,"But we want it to be seen . "
A,Elicit,"On the back ? "
C,Minor,"But you don't "
A,Minor,"It d visible "
C,Task,"But uh comm yeah comm you don't see it . "
D,Task,"We need it to be seen . "
A,Task,"Visibility though "
A,Task,"'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery . "
C,Other,"Well comm hang on . "
C,Task,"The other option is comm I don't know if you can see it but it's like if "
A,Other,"I can find it again . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's like the second to last slide . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And yours was called Interface Concept ? "
C,Task,"Interface comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"This one ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . Um . "
A,Task,"Well comm for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly . "
C,Task,"Okay comm it's the very right one . "
C,Task,"You see at the bottom comm "
C,Task,"it's kind of difficult to see comm but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like comm where the logo is comm "
C,Task,"and if we have the replaceable section comm it's like the top . "
C,Task,"It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top . "
A,Minor,"Mm "
C,Task,"And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in . "
A,Task,"Okay comm yes "
C,Elicit,"If c you envisioning it ? "
C,Task,"And so that stays the same when you have the logo comm "
A,Task,"yes . "
C,Task,"and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Like a little cut-out kind of "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"That's like comm you know comm a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"And so comm what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_ ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Some of tho "
A,Elicit,"Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ? "
D,Task,"Well comm some of those buttons though are blue-based . "
D,Task,"Um well comm a lot of those buttons are blue-based . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Well comm kind of . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact comm they could illuminate yellow . "
C,Task,"Yellow . "
A,Task,"Yellow comm I like that idea . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Like if we "
D,Task,"like the one all the way on the left comm "
D,Task,"uh you ca you can see it on your computer better . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Um where the button is actually blue comm but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons . "
C,Other,"Oh comm that one . "
A,Task,"I like the yellow illumination idea comm very good . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Any other ideas or thoughts ? "
A,Task,"We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so "
C,Other,"Um . Ha hang on "
C,Task,"Let me catch up . "
D,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
C,Elicit,"Did we finalise what buttons we're including "
C,Elicit,"or we just everything that we said before ? "
A,Task,"I think there will be time for that later . "
A,Task,"I'm guessing . "
A,Task,"'Kay comm well we're gonna wrap this up . "
A,Task,"Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes comm "
A,Task,"and here's what we're each of us going to do . "
A,Task,"The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design comm "
A,Task,"the U_I_D_ the user interface design . "
A,Task,"I think you're going to get a lot of comm I mean comm the final say on what buttons get put "
A,Task,"We'll all talk about it comm "
A,Task,"but I think comm that's pretty much what you're gonna do comm "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I guess . "
A,Task,"'Kay . And you're gonna do some product evaluation . "
A,Task,"Okay comm and right now comm the I_D_ and U_I_D_ comm you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . "
B,Task,"Great . Play Doh . "
C,Task,"Fun . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm and you should all be getting an email pretty soon . "
A,Elicit,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Well comm thank you for a very productive meeting . "
B,Task,"Wonderful "
B,Other,"Ooh . "
