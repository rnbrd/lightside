A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group . "
A,Other,"Um I'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting "
A,Task,"uh just done in in note form "
A,Task,"and I haven't attributed anything to individuals comm "
A,Task,"because we're working strictly as a team here "
A,Task,"and uh n nobody's working equally comm "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
A,Minor,"so uh . Um "
A,Task,"we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour . "
A,Task,"Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items comm "
A,Task,"that switching was easy comm "
A,Task,"that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular comm "
A,Task,"um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting comm "
A,Task,"that the keys might be concave comm "
A,Task,"simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . "
A,Task,"Um should have interchangeable fascias "
A,Task,"so people can personalise it comm "
A,Task,"um illuminated "
A,Task,"so that people can see it in dark rooms . "
A,Task,"Um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls . "
A,Task,"Um and that it sh it should just always work comm whenever you uh um mm uh use it . "
A,Task,"And that it shouldn't be too small comm "
A,Task,"mm that it it gets lost . Um . "
A,Minor,"Now uh uh "
A,Other,"I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations . "
A,Other,"Uh before I do that comm however comm I will go through some new project requirements "
A,Task,"that um the the management have placed on us "
A,Task,"and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . "
A,Task,"Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this "
A,Task,"and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought . "
A,Minor,"Um and and then we'll "
A,Task,"as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out comm "
A,Task,"and we have uh forty minutes to do this in "
A,Minor,"and I uh "
A,Minor,"Anyway . Okay . Now comm "
A,Task,"the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . "
A,Task,"Um and and they want it only to cover televisions . "
A,Minor,"Um now comm "
A,Task,"what is not q quite clear from their directive is "
A,Elicit,"whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext "
A,Task,"or whether they don't want it to cover comm you know comm videos comm D_V_D_s comm um satellite boxes comm "
A,Task,"which uh I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . "
A,Task,"The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . "
A,Task,"Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind comm "
A,Task,"um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore comm they certainly do look at other things . "
A,Task,"Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . "
A,Task,"Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there comm the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background . "
A,Minor,"Um now "
A,Task,"this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . "
A,Task,"But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that . "
A,Task,"Um it also has to be simple comm "
A,Task,"which to some extent goes along w with the first one comm "
A,Task,"and that we've already said that it must be simple "
A,Task,"'cause that's what people want anyway . "
A,Task,"Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly comm "
A,Task,"which um mm uh is is is their choice comm "
A,Task,"but uh um we we need to talk that through . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm so uh "
A,Other,"after the meeting it'll be summarised "
A,Other,"and uh "
A,Other,"um notes sent out and uh etcetera . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody . "
A,Minor,"Um again I "
A,Task,"there is no order of precedence here "
A,Elicit,"um so I I I'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first ? "
D,Other,"Uh I don't mind . "
A,Minor,"P "
A,Task,"fine . "
D,Elicit,"Uh can I steal the cable ? "
A,Other,"Oh sorry comm "
A,Task,"you can indeed . "
D,Other,"Cheers . "
D,Minor,"I got a "
D,Elicit,"how do I start there ? "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Task,"if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen comm "
A,Task,"no "
A,Task,"the one to the right of that . "
D,Elicit,"That one . "
A,Task,"That one . "
D,Other,"Cool . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab . "
D,Task,"Took hundred people "
D,Task,"and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . "
D,Task,"Um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . "
D,Task,"See that comm as we kinda noticed comm seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . "
D,Task,"So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly . "
D,Task,"Uh along with um looking less ugly comm if it looks better comm eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . "
D,Task,"Which is a a plus for us comm "
D,Task,"if we can make it look better comm it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . "
D,Task,"Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . "
D,Minor,"I can empl "
D,Task,"I kinda take that to mean as um they they don't uh they comm yeah comm they only use they only work for the television "
D,Minor,"or "
D,Minor,"yeah like "
D,Task,"as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system comm a digital box comm a D_V_D_ player comm a video player and T_V_ . "
D,Minor,"If it was "
D,Task,"uh I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time "
D,Task,"and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . "
D,Task,"Uh again comm seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . "
D,Task,"I took to mean that they just they use it a lot comm "
D,Task,"they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume . "
D,Minor,"And uh yeah comm uh "
D,Task,"I think the big issue is "
D,Task,"fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons comm "
D,Minor,"'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like "
D,Minor,"well "
D,Task,"we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext comm "
D,Task,"but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used "
D,Minor,"and used very "
D,Task,"aren't considered relevant by the user . "
D,Task,"So I think maybe fewer buttons comm "
D,Task,"which also make the design look sleeker comm "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
D,Minor,"Uh um yeah and uh "
D,Task,"frustrations of like people losing remote control . "
D,Task,"I dunno "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ "
D,Minor,"or maybe that's b "
D,Task,"it would have to incorporate comm but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . "
D,Task,"Maybe like it'll beep or something . "
D,Minor,"And um comm yep comm "
D,Minor,"the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is "
D,Task,"Uh don't want to make it too complicated comm easy to use for uh new like first time users and stuff . "
D,Task,"And uh repetitive strain injury comm "
D,Task,"I suppose we should make it more comfortable "
D,Task,"and make ma possibly even use have to make it comm yeah comm fewer buttons comm "
D,Task,"like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . "
D,Task,"Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"Gosh comm "
A,Other,"must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote comm is all I can say . "
D,Minor,"But uh yeah . "
D,Task,"It also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition "
D,Task,"and younger people say they would . "
D,Task,"And uh there was another section on our on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays comm "
D,Task,"but the data wasn't there comm "
D,Task,"so . I don't actually know what the results for that were comm "
A,Other,"Mm . Right . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"so . "
D,Task,"May be incrementally emitting comm "
D,Task,"but yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I must say that um the uh I c can't remember what um f you know phone service I was using the other day comm "
A,Task,"but that had sorta speech recognition "
A,Task,"which worked uh remarkably well comm "
A,Task,"so that is indeed a uh um "
D,Task,"And uh it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you "
A,Task,"a thought "
A,Task,"and it it cuts out uh I was was gonna say comm you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ comm "
A,Other,"j just get jaw ache . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"sorry . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm um oh yeah comm so "
D,Task,"possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Other,"I've got some other things "
D,Task,"I couldn't fit onto this presentation . "
D,Elicit,"Um . You see this okay ? "
D,Minor,"Almost "
D,Task,"no ? "
D,Minor,"It's "
D,Other,"sorry "
D,Other,"it's a bit . "
D,Other,"I'll read out to you . "
D,Task,"Uh functionality comm uh like people's opinions on functionality comm the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . "
D,Minor,"So um "
D,Task,"like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine comm "
D,Task,"but it's not frequently used . "
D,Elicit,"You see what I mean ? "
D,Task,"Whereas channel selection comm which is very high relevance "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"is used the most . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"m we can maybe even start to cut down on or "
D,Task,"I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . "
D,Task,"Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"which are low relevance "
D,Task,"and rarely used . "
D,Task,"And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . I mean "
C,Minor,"It could be "
C,Other,"oh "
C,Task,"uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? "
C,Elicit,"Have you seen the new mo mobile phones "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"that flip out "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and they have the like texting comm and then the numbers on one side comm "
D,Other,"Oh yeah . "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"you could have the most used buttons on top "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and flip it out or something . "
A,Minor,"Hmm comm hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"like the one that like slides back "
A,Elicit,"Uh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ? "
D,Task,"and the buttons are concealed underneath . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether . "
D,Task,"Just remove them completely ? "
C,Minor,"That might be the "
A,Minor,"We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um "
A,Elicit,"I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition comm "
A,Minor,"given that um the "
A,Minor,"Um now "
A,Minor,"the the age structure we were looking at "
A,Task,"um I mean w we had usage by age structure comm "
A,Task,"what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . "
A,Minor,"Now "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah . "
A,Elicit,"do we know whether they "
A,Elicit,"Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group comm uh to put myself right in the middle of it comm um u use remote controls to a great extent . "
A,Minor,"Yes we "
D,Task,"Um no "
D,Task,"this is for pay more for speech recognition . "
A,Other,"That would 've speech recogn right . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Minor,"we're looking at "
A,Minor,"um well "
A,Task,"again comm we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
A,Task,"If we wanted something different comm truly different comm then the buttonless remote control w would be it . "
B,Minor,"P "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . "
B,Task,"If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing comm that's gonna be quite a change . "
A,Minor,"But if you just lift it up and say comm channel one or B_B_C_ "
B,Minor,"It might "
D,Task,"Or even I mean you could even just have it left on . "
D,Task,"You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ "
C,Minor,"Maybe i "
D,Task,"and never have to "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box "
C,Task,"and have it just go on the T_V_ "
C,Task,"and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are comm "
C,Task,"you won't lose it . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"It c "
A,Minor,"well "
A,Minor,"it "
A,Task,"I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the comm you know comm the sound from the television comm "
B,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh comm you know comm I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself comm "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"B_B_C_ one . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
A,Task,"just to activate it . "
D,Task,"Oh yeah . "
A,Task,"Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . "
A,Minor,"And and then just say comm oh I don't know comm a thought and and then "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . "
A,Task,"Um 'cause uh you know audio settings comm nought point eight percent . "
A,Elicit,"I mean if they weren't there comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
A,Elicit,"would people miss them ? "
B,Task,"But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . "
D,Task,"Relevance of two out of ten comm "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Vol volume comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"yes um "
B,Task,"They're not used often "
A,Minor,"th "
B,Task,"but they are quite important when they're used . "
A,Task,"w we need to s identify things that people actually need "
B,Elicit,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . "
A,Task,"And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment comm "
A,Minor,"um the channel and volume "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh channel and volume are the only ones that "
D,Task,"Stand out . "
A,Task,"uh would appear to be essential . "
A,Minor,"Um . So "
A,Task,"if we can design something that that looks interesting comm "
A,Minor,"know comm "
A,Task,"or looks different comm "
A,Task,"um incorporates the the logo and and the colours "
A,Task,"and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey comm um "
A,Task,"and uh I dunno comm "
A,Task,"buttons or or buttons as an option . "
D,Task,"Uh I just had a thought actually comm "
D,Other,"sorry to interrupt . "
A,Other,"Do comm please . "
D,Task,"Uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"we could maybe have like an activation "
D,Task,"word . "
D,Task,"'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before comm "
A,Task,"You cer certainly could . "
D,Task,"where you just you address the remote comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"you address the computer comm "
D,Task,"and then give it a command . "
A,Minor,"Depe uh i depends whether um "
A,Task,"if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say "
D,Other,"Oh I see . Oh yeah comm I see . "
A,Task,"B_B_C_ one . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Task,"I mean you could print actually print it on the uh "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm comm yeah . "
A,Task,"device itself . Um . "
D,Task,"I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . "
A,Minor,"S "
A,Task,"th this I th that's always gonna be a problem I think . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Um and I I I s "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"I suppose one um "
A,Task,"could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . "
A,Minor,"Anyway comm "
A,Other,"sorry comm "
A,Task,"carry on . "
A,Elicit,"Do you want to just carry on with "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"no "
D,Task,"I I interrupted you comm "
A,Minor,"or "
A,Task,"no no comm no "
D,Other,"sorry . "
A,Task,"uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . "
D,Other,"Oh "
D,Task,"okay . "
D,Minor,"Um well comm "
D,Task,"I was just kinda wrapping up there . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I was thinking um comm yeah comm maybe such things are relevant . "
A,Minor,"Mm okay . "
D,Minor,"We could make things much more f I think the the "
D,Task,"eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better comm "
D,Minor,"combined with uh decrease the or "
D,Task,"take out the limited functio functions "
D,Task,"that we don't really use much . "
D,Task,"alright take out teletext comm "
D,Task,"but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . "
D,Task,"But comm since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um "
D,Task,"Oh comm we could comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"We c "
D,Minor,"yeah comm "
D,Task,"we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this "
A,Minor,"'cause we're "
D,Task,"and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time comm "
D,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"Certainly could . Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"So uh yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection comm wouldn't have to really "
A,Task,"The I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"and probably it would look better as well . "
A,Minor,"No comm "
A,Task,"it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh comm you know comm visually very distinctive . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . yeah . "
A,Task,"Um 'cause you know comm it does not have to be a oblong box . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Lined with numbered buttons and "
A,Task,"Mm comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"who "
A,Other,"sorry comm "
A,Elicit,"have you have you finished there Andy ? "
D,Task,"Uh yeah comm yeah comm that's everything . "
A,Other,"Yep comm yep . "
A,Task,"Um given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh . "
C,Minor,"Okay well comm "
C,Other,"I can do mine . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Elicit,"Do you want the cable ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Other,"let's see if I can make this work . Um . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"you have to hit like function and F_ something . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"F_ eight . "
B,Minor,"F_ eight . "
C,Minor,"Is it doing "
B,Task,"Dunno . "
D,Task,"Uh comm give it about twenty seconds comm or so . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Ah comm "
B,Task,"Oh yeah comm "
C,Task,"Oh okay . "
A,Task,"there we go . "
B,Task,"it's going . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so "
C,Task,"this is just about the technical functions . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"the method comm I looked online for examples of other similar products "
C,Task,"and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas "
C,Task,"and um identify what the necessary things are comm what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do . "
C,Task,"Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . "
C,Task,"There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one "
C,Task,"which I will have pictures of "
C,Task,"and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"these are the two different ones . "
C,Task,"This one um this is the user centred comm "
C,Task,"it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons "
C,Task,"and then this is the engineering centred comm "
C,Task,"which has a lot more buttons comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and probably this is one that people complain about comm about having too many buttons "
C,Task,"that you don't use . "
C,Minor,"So basically comm "
C,Task,"what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set comm "
C,Minor,"you know comm "
C,Task,"turn on comm off comm switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . "
C,Task,"And so for this product it's gonna be television only comm "
C,Task,"and then it has to have the uh logos "
C,Task,"for the company and the colours . "
C,Minor,"And so comm "
C,Task,"for my personal preferences comm I think this one is easier to use "
C,Task,"and has quite a you know comm fewer buttons . "
C,Task,"Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television "
C,Task,"and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . "
C,Task,"It looks kind of narrow at the top comm "
C,Task,"and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top comm "
A,Minor,"Mm comm yeah . "
C,Task,"then that would be easier . "
C,Minor,"Um and so "
C,Task,"we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . "
C,Minor,"E "
C,Task,"the unique style comm maybe have it light up "
C,Task,"so it's visible in the dark comm "
C,Task,"um the changeable face-plates comm "
C,Minor,"and the lighting up and visible I was "
C,Task,"when we were talking about havi losing it comm "
C,Task,"maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that comm "
C,Task,"so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"that's my presentation . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"can I um I'm actually gonna use the um "
A,Task,"it's gonna cause great technical problems over here . "
A,Other,"I'm actually gonna use the "
C,Minor,"F "
C,Task,"they probably clip to you . "
B,Other,"Oh yeah comm "
B,Task,"they might be movable . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Oh yeah comm "
B,Minor,"they're all "
B,Task,"they're not connected to anything on the table comm "
B,Task,"you just leave 'em on "
B,Task,"and walk around with 'em . "
A,Minor,"Yes comm "
A,Minor,"rather than the uh the the traditional "
A,Other,"in fact comm um I won't even go that far . "
A,Task,"Um something like this shape comm "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Task,"sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape comm "
A,Task,"um that you you sort of hold in your hand comm "
A,Minor,"um comm well "
A,Task,"I'm trying to think "
A,Task,"uh uh uh l uh l such as I mean um something you hold up like that comm "
A,Task,"possibly with a couple of buttons like that comm "
A,Task,"but with the the entire top with the comm you know comm the uh the infrared or whatever source . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Uh so that you know comm it's flying off in all directions comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"so that uh um uh "
A,Task,"again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of um "
A,Task,"actually achieving that in terms of whether the comm you know comm the power requirements of the uh such a source comm um you know comm compromise the our our need for uh you know comm it it being um mm permanently uh you know comm available . "
A,Minor,"Uh whether whether different technology um "
A,Task,"I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared comm "
A,Task,"and like they have been for a long time . "
A,Task,"Uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different comm um you know comm short range comm not like the old uh radio remote controls "
A,Task,"where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours . Um "
A,Minor,"but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for i "
A,Task,"if minimum number of buttons is our priority comm then we should comm as I say comm r know comm really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum comm "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Task,"possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . Um and nothing else . "
A,Task,"Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that comm "
A,Task,"but again comm except that um you know the risk of losing it . "
A,Minor,"Um anyway okay um so "
A,Task,"Kate comm wh what are your uh your thoughts on this ? "
B,Task,"Yes comm mm . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
B,Elicit,"Which one does this plug into ? "
C,Task,"Hmm I think it's all there . "
B,Other,"That one . "
C,Minor,"H "
B,Minor,"I can't did you "
B,Elicit,"could you see it on you screen "
B,Minor,"when it "
C,Task,"Oh yeah . "
C,Task,"That's kind of strange . "
B,Task,"That's not cool . "
B,Other,"Oh well . "
B,Minor,"Anyways . Um alright comm yeah comm so um "
B,Other,"I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh . "
B,Other,"Oh there we go . "
B,Minor,"Okay um "
B,Task,"just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works . "
B,Task,"Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system comm the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever . "
B,Task,"Um and it does this uh by well comm you need to start off you need an energy source "
B,Task,"and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip "
B,Task,"and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote "
B,Task,"um which will then be sent to the uh the television comm the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do . "
B,Task,"Um and you need a user interface comm "
B,Task,"which controls the chip and thus the messages "
B,Task,"and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . Um "
B,Task,"Oh shoot . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh just general findings . "
B,Task,"Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source comm uh some sort of user interface comm "
B,Task,"which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . "
B,Task,"Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver . "
B,Minor,"And um "
B,Other,"oops . "
B,Other,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . "
B,Task,"Uh this just kinda represents the energy source "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"which feeds into the circuit chip "
B,Task,"uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch "
B,Task,"which would send signals f to um a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between "
B,Task,"so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons . "
B,Task,"Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb comm "
B,Task,"which will be the part that actually what ? Sends signals to the the television . "
B,Task,"And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there . "
B,Minor,"And so "
B,Other,"my personal preferences "
B,Task,"I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out comm "
B,Task,"uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery "
B,Task,"or a battery dock you could place it in comm "
B,Task,"so it'd constantly be charged comm "
B,Task,"so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . "
B,Task,"Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver comm "
B,Task,"so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room comm and the channel'll still be changed . "
B,Task,"Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface "
B,Task,"um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it comm "
B,Task,"so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions comm as they inevitably do comm you can find them easily . "
B,Task,"And that's pretty much it . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"before we um "
A,Task,"I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls comm particularly sort of independent ones . "
A,Task,"Um given "
A,Task,"you know comm the number of things you buy these days comm which you know comm have a a a lithium whatever battery in comm "
A,Task,"that's uh comm you know never needs replacing . "
A,Task,"Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control comm "
A,Minor,"uh um you know comm "
A,Minor,"one some sort of typical usage . "
A,Minor,"You know comm "
A,Task,"the the the battery will last "
A,Task,"know comm five comm ten years . "
A,Task,"By which time I mean when all's said and done comm the digital television will be taking over in that time scale . Um "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"uh uh p perhaps we should comm know comm reduce the uh comm you know comm the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment "
A,Minor,"and uh "
B,Elicit,"Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and if if anybody manages to run it down comm we'll we'll give 'em a new one . "
B,Task,"Oh comm cool . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm fair enough . "
A,Minor,"Um it's comm you know comm it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a "
A,Minor,"well comm "
A,Task,"it's actually a marketing gimmick . "
A,Task,"I mean it's hardly a gimmick comm "
A,Task,"it's uh it's totally practical . "
A,Minor,"Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um "
A,Task,"uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by comm you know comm magnetic waves or whatever comm "
A,Minor,"if if it "
D,Task,"It could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm comm mm . "
A,Elicit,"Are are people really gonna use it though ? Um . "
D,Task,"I suppose comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"people are pro "
B,Task,"Mm yeah "
C,Task,"I would think that people might forget "
C,Task,"I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there comm "
A,Minor,"I I th I think "
B,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
C,Minor,"so . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"it's "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"um I mean I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning "
A,Task,"and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . Um . "
B,Task,"'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies . "
B,Minor,"And that's pretty much "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"When it "
A,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Other,"wh when it's died is a problem . "
B,Task,"yeah . Yeah comm "
B,Task,"when it turns itself off comm that's when I plug it in comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
A,Minor,"yeah comm so uh um "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm think that's a good idea . "
D,Task,"Uh . That sounds pretty good comm yeah . "
C,Other,"No . "
A,Minor,"Is the "
A,Minor,"uh you know comm "
A,Task,"we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Um you know comm "
A,Task,"cut cost within the "
A,Task,"manufacturing "
A,Task,"and uh you know comm if we have a high tech interior comm then then that that sh may well be cost effective . "
C,Elicit,"Do they make batteries that last that long ? "
A,Minor,"I mean "
A,Minor,"th th "
A,Task,"certainly . "
A,Task,"Um I can't think of anything off the s top of my head comm "
A,Task,"but there are certainly things that you buy . I mean calculators for example . "
B,Task,"They usually have the little light uh source comm "
B,Task,"I dunno what the heck they're called comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm they have that little solar "
B,Minor,"the but "
B,Task,"yeah comm the little cells "
B,Minor,"that "
A,Task,"Som well some do comm "
A,Minor,"I mean "
A,Minor,"th th "
A,Task,"but there are battery ones "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"that um are you know comm sort of permanently sealed . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"In in fact I'd "
B,Elicit,"Most of them comm don't they have sort of a combination of the two comm "
B,Minor,"like "
B,Task,"when there is light comm they'll work off the light comm "
B,Task,"and if there isn't comm they'll kick into this battery comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"uh uh "
B,Task,"so we can maybe do something like that "
B,Task,"whereas there is a battery comm "
B,Task,"but if there's enough light comm then it's using the light comm "
B,Task,"so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"but you will have the battery there for when you need it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm I I mean "
A,Task,"th th this needs going t into the technology a bit . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I would think is i is is probably comm you know comm no more than minutes in its entire life . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"it depend if it's uh depends who who's using it comm who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"some people are "
A,Task,"If comm but I say if if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"then they're clicking a lot comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"W "
D,Task,"like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used comm channel selection a hundred and sixty eight "
A,Minor,"n "
D,Task,"times per hour . "
A,Other,"Right . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Other,"Per hour ? "
C,Task,"Wow . That's a lot . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Task,"I must admit I hadn't um I'd I'd missed that . "
A,Task,"That does sound excessive . "
D,Task,"But then again comm if you think it of the amount of comm you know amount of use it's like "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That's it's less than a second comm um . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"that's right comm "
A,Elicit,"and and I I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"or whether it's just a "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"sorta tenth of a second comm no matter how long you press it for comm "
A,Task,"I don't know I don't actually know . Um . "
C,Task,"Though I think with digital T_V_ comm like I know on my cable box comm you're not supposed to do that "
C,Task,"because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"channels that way instead of "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Right comm so "
A,Task,"I've got a message to say five minutes comm "
A,Task,"I dunno how long ago that appeared . "
A,Minor,"Um 'cause we're we're getting "
C,Task,"Uh-oh . "
A,Minor,"um right comm so "
A,Other,"I'd I need to sum up very quickly here um . "
A,Task,"We're looking at extreme simplicity . "
A,Task,"We're looking at a radically different shape . "
A,Task,"Possibly no buttons at all um comm "
A,Task,"but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design comm then then that's fine . "
A,Task,"Um in the I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here comm "
A,Task,"because comm you know comm shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint . "
A,Task,"But we clearly only need th the main buttons comm although comm uh if clearly only need the main functions . "
A,Task,"Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition "
A,Task,"um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control comm volume control and on off . "
A,Task,"Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo comm uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme "
A,Task,"and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers . "
A,Elicit,"Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yep . Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"So uh "
C,Minor,"Oh "
C,Other,"I just have one question . "
A,Task,"Yeah . We are doing just the television . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"are we doing just the television "
C,Elicit,"or are we doing "
C,Elicit,"so not D_V_D_ players comm "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"we "
C,Other,"okay comm okay . "
A,Task,"I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given comm "
B,Task,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"no ? "
C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"like in the email of television only . In fact they're in the constraints email that I got . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Elicit,"Didn't you mention the teletext comm just television only ? "
A,Task,"Oh yeah "
A,Minor,"well "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"th that's one I s that's one I sent you comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh what came down from from head office . Um "
D,Other,"Oh okay . Oh yeah . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Oh okay . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"That's that that that that's their uh their view . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so uh "
A,Task,"we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting comm "
A,Other,"thank you very much indeed . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Cool . "
