A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"Hello . "
D,Other,"Good afternoon . "
D,Other,"Sorry I'm a little late . "
A,Other,"No problem . "
D,Task,"Got stuck in the traffic . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"That's possible on uh this time of day . "
A,Task,"Starts at three o'clock . Uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm let me see . "
A,Task,"Our fourth and last meeting . "
A,Other,"There he is . "
A,Other,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,"this our last meeting . "
A,Task,"In this meeting we will discuss our final design . "
A,Task,"And we will do some evaluation about the comm not only the product comm but also the project . "
A,Task,"And then we're going to close the project today as well . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"after this you will be uh free to go "
A,Task,"and uh spend all your money . "
A,Task,"And this uh design comm detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design comm the usability interface design comm "
A,Task,"and we will do the product evaluation . "
A,Task,"Um comm in order to do that we have this agenda . "
A,Task,"We'll have the prototype presentation first . "
A,Task,"Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . "
A,Task,"Then we will look at the finance . "
A,Task,"Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . "
A,Task,"Because everything costs money comm "
A,Task,"and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . "
A,Task,"So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote . "
A,Task,"But we will see that later . "
A,Task,"Then we will do the project uh evaluation comm "
A,Task,"and the closing after that . "
A,Task,"We've got forty minutes . "
A,Task,"So we will be finished at half past three . "
A,Task,"But first um we will do the this is prototype presentation . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"if some yeah if somebody wants step forward . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"this is what me and Richard came up with . "
C,Task,"The default spot for the on-off button . "
C,Task,"The mute button just below that . "
C,Task,"Then there's the volume and channel selectors . "
C,Task,"Simple plus-minus button . "
C,Task,"Uh we thought of a help button . "
C,Task,"If you hold it and you press another button comm uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Task,"Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo . "
C,Task,"So it's rather simple prototype . "
C,Task,"And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Sure "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"uh just pop in at any time . "
D,Task,"Um comm when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . "
B,Task,"Uh comm that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Minor,"You put it uh "
B,Task,"you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"And you "
B,Task,"But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext comm and shifting uh down . So "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Okay . Um Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Uh but um "
A,Task,"I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons . "
B,Minor,"Oh yeah ? "
A,Task,"But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . "
A,Elicit,"So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons . "
C,Task,"I think if you look at most controls comm they've got more buttons than this . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
C,Minor,"And well "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"the on-off button comm it's it's a necessity . "
C,Task,"You can't drop that one . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"The volume and channel buttons comm you need you obviously need those those . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . "
C,Task,"So we could cancel that one . "
C,Task,"I think the help button really is necessary "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Uh comm or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh "
A,Task,"Long time . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"If you put "
B,Minor,"But m "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We disc discuss that already . "
B,Task,"But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option . "
B,Task,"So uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and uh "
A,Other,"Yeah . Okay . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"you can't leave out the number buttons I guess . "
B,Minor,"And uh "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And "
A,Task,"Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So it's rather basic already . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Think so . "
D,Task,"That's what I pointed out earlier . "
D,Task,"If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
A,Elicit,"we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"they're "
C,Task,"It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Just n normal plain buttons . "
B,Minor,"it "
C,Task,"But they're supposed to be equal sized comm round comm with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume comm the the triangle and stuff . "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
A,Other,"Yeah . 'Kay . "
B,Task,"Just to recognise it comm "
B,Minor,"so uh "
C,Task,"Just for recognition . "
B,Minor,"Uh yeah "
B,Task,"and now we don't need uh LEDs "
B,Minor,"or um Y uh "
A,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"s some uh remote controls uh do it also comm "
A,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"but um uh because we use the little display "
B,Task,"we don't uh have to use it . "
B,Minor,"Uh so "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case . "
B,Minor,"Nay . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"So they jump out . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And uh that's about it . "
A,Task,"That's nice . "
A,Task,"Then because we only have thirty minutes left comm "
A,Other,"I will move on to the finance part comm "
A,Task,"which is pretty exciting comm to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . "
A,Task,"And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"If we see "
A,Task,"I don't know if I've filled in correctly comm "
A,Task,"so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . "
A,Task,"I counted two batteries . "
A,Task,"But maybe we can also use one . "
A,Elicit,"I don't know if it's possible . "
D,Task,"Since it rechargeable . "
A,Task,"It's rechargeable . That's right . "
B,Task,"Yeah we can "
B,Minor,"u just uh "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"That's two Euros off . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"We need the advanced chip . "
A,Task,"So there's not much to uh to save there . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Here we have the single curves . "
A,Task,"Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I don't know comm "
A,Task,"but I think the single curved is good for design comm and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"I think we have to keep that . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Then we have the case material supplements . "
A,Task,"It's plastic . "
A,Task,"It's the cheapest one we need . "
A,Task,"So that's uh not much to save either . "
A,Task,"But then the biggest costs are the buttons . "
A,Task,"So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um comm "
A,Minor,"so if we "
A,Task,"Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . "
B,Task,"Uh Sixteen comm I believe so . "
A,Minor,"Because I "
A,Other,"Sixteen . "
A,Task,"Nah comm "
A,Task,"that will be even more then . "
A,Task,"Eighteen Euros . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"Uh seventeen . Uh with the help button . "
A,Other,"seventeen . "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Other,"Okay comm including the help ? "
C,Task,"Yep . "
D,Other,"Damn . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Uh seventeen . "
A,Task,"I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long comm or pressing down a a number long . "
B,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"That saves us uh one Euro already . "
A,Elicit,"'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Wouldn't "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Fifteen buttons . "
D,Other,"No . That wouldn't be an option . "
A,Minor,"And this is "
D,Task,"Uh comm d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each comm "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"No those are one comm I think . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"think actually there're two buttons comm "
B,Minor,"Where did uh "
B,Task,"Uh comm it's just one button . "
D,Elicit,"aren't they ? "
B,Minor,"But comm um Yeah . "
B,Task,"There were uh two uh for one big button . "
B,Task,"But they are uh more expensive than the small ones . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm yeah . So "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"but th it's not stated in this files . "
B,Minor,"It's just a . "
A,Task,"So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one comm by pressing "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"I was thinking comm maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . "
A,Task,"That's possibility as well . "
D,Task,"That would cut the cost . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"And it's good for the design as well . "
A,Minor,"So you can make "
A,Minor,"Uh let's see . "
A,Task,"If you make this "
A,Task,"Looks a bit like uh a cross . "
A,Other,"Plus . Min . "
B,Task,"But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper . "
A,Minor,"Uh s yeah "
A,Minor,"channel . "
B,Minor,"So uh comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"we've still got four buttons comm "
A,Minor,"w "
B,Minor,"but just um So "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"th I think they count uh the materials . "
B,Task,"You got uh not not a butt button itself comm but uh on the um "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"on the chip there . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"That's right . That's right . "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But I think because we have the advanced chip "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"we can just count this as one button . "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"No "
A,Minor,"but I think "
D,Task,"But comm I think this really is four buttons anyhow . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Maybe it is comm "
A,Task,"but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . "
A,Task,"Also the L_C_ display comm I think it's comm I think it's too expensive for the display we use . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Uh that's that's a big cost . "
A,Minor,"I think they uh try t "
C,Task,"If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . "
A,Task,"That's right comm "
A,Elicit,"but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? "
D,Task,"Only the docking station comm I guess . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic . "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"it's not even taken into the price . "
A,Task,"That's extra . That's extra . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
D,Task,"Maybe we should to a different supplier . "
A,Task,"That's an option . "
A,Task,"Poland . Something . Polish supplier . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Don't you think we can comm if we can count this as v as one button comm and integrate th uh these buttons in three comm "
A,Task,"then we save a lot of money as well . "
C,Task,"We we could save money on it . "
C,Elicit,"But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ? "
B,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's what I'm wondering . "
C,Task,"My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's a point . "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ? "
B,Minor,"So um Yeah . "
B,Task,"We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty "
B,Minor,"or Can't uh go um "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"No . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier comm more easy comm "
D,Task,"maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . "
D,Task,"Especially since we have those nice features . "
B,Minor,"Nay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . "
A,Task,"We don't have any more budget to develop it . "
C,Task,"The margin will get too small . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Is it impossible to "
A,Minor,"Yeah . So "
B,Elicit,"But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty . "
B,Task,"I don't think so . "
A,Task,"It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons . Say Or you can take the single chip . "
D,Task,"It would be a be a pretty rigid one . "
B,Minor,"S "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Ten . "
B,Minor,"But comm you can't use uh "
A,Task,"There it is . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"But then w "
A,Task,"Good looking . "
B,Task,"Uh comm wi with n Oh comm with uh attractive uh o options . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So uh comm "
B,Task,"you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I think it's uh difficult as well comm "
D,Minor,"Or b "
A,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost comm or just any other remote control . "
C,Task,"No remote . "
A,Task,"Or we can leave out the ten buttons "
A,Task,"and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . "
B,Task,"Scroll-wheel's one . "
A,Minor,"Then w "
A,Task,"Because then we save ten buttons . "
C,Minor,"That's "
B,Minor,"No comm "
B,Minor,"it "
A,Task,"Then we have five and one . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"And and see . "
A,Other,"If we have this one and we've got the advanced "
A,Task,"W uh comm we're getting close . "
C,Task,"We're getting closer . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"But how does scroll-wheel work here ? "
A,Minor,"Then you will Or maybe you can um scroll . "
A,Task,"If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . "
A,Task,"Until you've got the right number comm then you push it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . Integrated scroll-wheel push-button . "
A,Other,"Alright . "
A,Task,"It's gotta scroll and push . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Okay "
A,Task,"but then you you can push uh some other button as well . "
D,Minor,"But Yeah . "
C,Task,"You could just not scroll for a half a second . "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second comm then it g turns to that channel . "
C,Task,"So you won't need a button . "
D,Task,"I think that would be like the end of our usability . "
B,Minor,"D "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"But it would definitely crop cost comm a lot . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"And we need the battery . "
A,Elicit,"And the regular chip is not possible ? "
A,Elicit,"It has to be advanced ? "
C,Task,"If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip comm yes . "
A,Other,"It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"And we can save a Euro by a flat design . "
A,Minor,"That's an option we can "
C,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Ja ja . "
A,Task,"Then we're almost there . "
C,Task,"Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"if we "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"but I think that's That is a big advantage comm "
B,Minor,"So Yeah "
A,Minor,"if we're "
B,Task,"Yeah it's a big advantage . "
B,Minor,"But um comm it's "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"Can we use "
A,Elicit,"can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? "
C,Task,"I think so . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Elicit,"If you push it three times ? "
D,Minor,"think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"right now you just push the teletext button comm "
D,Task,"go to page eight eight eight comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and teletext disappears . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But the subtitles stay there . "
B,Minor,"But if you push the teletext button twice "
D,Task,"I think that's the case on most "
C,Elicit,"What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . "
B,Minor,"It's uh One m uh one b uh comm a few buttons . "
A,Task,"Ah that's not really that "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"that could be just uh like the scroll to eight comm click comm scroll to eight comm click comm scroll to eight comm click . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
D,Task,"But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people comm "
D,Task,"who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is . "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . "
A,Minor,"No . "
D,Task,"With only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel . "
A,Task,"I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide comm you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . "
A,Task,"If you just make it real simple . "
A,Task,"Because it saves it saves a lot of money . "
A,Task,"And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen comm "
A,Task,"which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . "
D,Task,"True . True . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these . "
A,Other,"Mm eraser ? "
A,Minor,"And we put uh "
A,Task,"Looks a bit odd maybe . "
D,Task,"That's a pretty big scroll wheel . "
A,Minor,"That is "
A,Task,"Something like that . "
A,Task,"Then comm yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . "
A,Task,"One comm two comm three comm four comm five buttons comm if we erase this one . "
A,Task,"And these are two buttons then . "
C,Task,"We could make two buttons out of that . "
C,Task,"And just um If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel . "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's really a good good idea comm I think . "
A,Task,"And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed . "
C,Task,"More obvious . "
A,Task,"So we make one for the volume comm one for the channel . Plus scroll . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"if we "
A,Task,"That's right . "
A,Task,"So we've got one comm two comm three . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"we can leave the teletext in if we want . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's m that's better . "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"So this is five buttons . "
C,Task,"If we leave out all those buttons comm perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . "
C,Task,"And make it smaller overall . "
C,Task,"So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button comm the screen right behi under that comm than the scroll button "
A,Minor,"Y yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh yeah comm "
C,Task,"you get a a much smaller remote . "
A,Minor,"and then you can "
B,Task,"Uh yeah . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
C,Minor,"And it sh "
A,Task,"So we can decrease this one to four buttons . "
C,Other,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Right now we have five . "
B,Task,"But uh comm you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's no problem . "
B,Task,"Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . "
B,Minor,"It uh it's a bit uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made comm I think . "
A,Task,"Single curved is really easy to just fill in . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And cases come right out of the machine . "
B,Minor,". "
A,Task,"And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine comm than a flat one . "
A,Task,"I think this is a really easy one . Um comm "
A,Elicit,"what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? "
A,Elicit,"Freek comm what do you think ? "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"I still think we should go for the single curve design . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But then again comm all these changes are not really okay with me . "
B,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Richard's argument was very good . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"But since we just have to . "
A,Task,"We have to cut costs . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah "
D,Task,"I'd rather just go to the board "
A,Minor,"I'm ag "
D,Task,"and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote . "
A,Task,"Ask for more money . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Or do some market research and see what the options are . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So people will use it more comm and especially for the help functions comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"it will be good if we have scroll bar comm scroll button . "
A,Task,"It will be necessary to have good help function comm as well . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"this is scroll . "
A,Task,"I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . Before we went on to the to the whole design . "
D,Task,"Yes . Definitely . "
B,Minor,"The th "
A,Other,"But I'm glad we could make a bit . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's pretty different comm if you saw the last one than this one . "
D,Task,"It's pretty different . "
D,Task,"But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell . "
A,Task,"Yeah . It will . Yeah . "
D,Task,"'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . "
B,Minor,"But um "
D,Task,"This is not familiar for them . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"but I think "
D,Task,"So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them . "
A,Minor,"I think the most "
B,Task,"But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . "
B,Task,"Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
B,Minor,"So maybe it's uh "
A,Minor,"We can let l "
A,Task,"We can stick it out comm a bit . Like a old old buttons . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's a good one . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"I'm afraid we have to move on . "
A,Task,"And it's uh it's b uh less frightening comm I think . "
A,Task,"If they see this design they think oh comm there are only five buttons comm and uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But we will see . "
D,Task,"That's true . "
D,Task,"Might uh might be confusing too . "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's definitely right . "
D,Task,"They'd be like comm what ? Only five buttons ? "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But very special comm "
B,Minor,"so uh "
A,Task,"I would buy it . "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But you're not sixty . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
A,Task,"I would buy it if I was six . "
A,Task,"No I don't know . "
A,Elicit,"What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? "
A,Elicit,"No ? "
A,Task,"Uh comm yes they are . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"No . "
A,Task,"But we can go on with the project evaluation . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Let's see . "
A,Other,"I can sit down I think . "
A,Task,"We still have fifteen minutes left comm "
A,Task,"so we're nice on schedule . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um comm the project process . "
D,Minor,"So um comm "
D,Task,"I like set up all these criteria . And evaluation of the thingy . "
A,Other,"Evaluation criteria . That's right . "
A,Task,"That was the the point I forgot . "
A,Minor,"I should "
A,Task,"There we are . Evaluation criteria . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Task,"Go ahead . "
A,Task,"We've got five minutes I think for those criteria . "
D,Other,"Five more minutes ? "
A,Task,"No we've got fifteen minutes "
A,Minor,"but "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Uh yes . What ? "
D,Minor,"'Kay so "
D,Task,"I did some literature study study comm and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . "
A,Minor,"Uh yeah . "
D,Task,"Translated it into criteria comm "
D,Task,"which would be these . "
D,Task,"Um comm is the remote fancy ? The shape comm look and feel . "
D,Task,"Innovative ? What new functions are there ? "
D,Task,"Uh comm easy to use ? "
D,Task,"Uh comm learnability is a very important factor here . "
D,Task,"Uh comm is it functional ? "
D,Task,"Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? "
D,Task,"And are the those functions that are there comm are they useful ? "
D,Task,"And the cost . "
D,Task,"The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? "
D,Task,"And recognability . If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? "
D,Minor,"And "
D,Task,"So we're supposed to evaluate it right now . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Let's see . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"I have to say this was a little hard comm "
D,Task,"because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"that's because my pen failed to upload his data . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"I tried to "
D,Task,"Interesting . "
A,Task,"but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Mm . 'Kay . "
D,Elicit,"Is the design fancy comm on a scale of one to seven ? "
A,Task,"I think it's fancy . "
C,Task,"Six . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Six . "
B,Task,"Uh six . Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"We all go for six ? "
D,Task,"Good . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm is the design innovative ? "
A,Task,"Very . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Sh "
D,Task,"I think so comm "
D,Task,"with our L_C_D_ screen comm docking station comm scroll-buttons . "
A,Task,"Subtitles comm buttons . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Seven . "
D,Other,"Seven ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So we've got twenty cents for our docking station comm "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
D,Task,"Should be do-able . "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's right . "
D,Elicit,"Is the design easy to use ? "
B,Task,"Mm . Not really . "
A,Task,"That's a bit dodgy . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"Would be for us . "
D,Minor,"But "
B,Minor,"For old people I I "
A,Task,"I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five . "
C,Task,"Four or five . Yes . "
B,Minor,"W "
B,Task,"Yeah . Four . "
D,Task,"I'd go for four comm too . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Is it functional ? "
D,Elicit,"Is the design functional ? "
D,Elicit,"Um comm do we have all functions that we want to include ? "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"N "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think we do . "
D,Elicit,"Do we have too many functions ? "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"I don't think so . "
D,Task,"It's pretty slim . "
A,Task,"Think it's uh seven . "
D,Other,"Seven . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Elicit,"and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and R_S_I_ influences ? "
B,Minor,"Mm m "
C,Task,"Mm comm we haven't thought of that one . "
A,Minor,"It was . "
D,Task,"Think we do . "
A,Task,"I had them worked out . "
A,Task,"Mm . They are ugly comm not very functional comm and getting lost . "
D,Elicit,"Are the production costs within the preset limits ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"they are now . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Does the design fit the group of focus ? "
C,Task,"I think that's a three . "
B,Task,"Mm comm th yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No "
A,Task,"I think with our new radio button comm I think it's uh I think it's better . "
D,Task,"I think it doesn't . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh We have to test it "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Minor,"s But "
C,Task,"I still I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy . "
D,Minor,"I think "
A,Minor,"I think it "
D,Task,"I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control . "
B,Task,"Uh comm yeah comm true . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I would give it a four . "
D,Task,"I'm not sure . "
D,Task,"I think I'd go for two . "
B,Task,"I go for three . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Then we have to do the three . "
A,Minor,"It's the "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Elicit,"Is the company company recognisable ? "
A,Task,"Yes it is . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"we have the logo there . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"And they wanna put fashion in their products . Uh in the slogan of the company . "
A,Task,"And we have the removable front cases . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So comm I think it's very recognisable . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"So that will be this . "
D,Task,"I was also supposed to calculate the score comm "
D,Task,"but thought we would have another private thingy after this . "
A,Task,"We've got a calculate it . "
A,Other,"Mm ? "
C,Other,"Twendag sieven an twendag . "
D,Minor,"Is this "
D,Minor,"Like "
D,Elicit,"after this comm are we done ? Or "
A,Minor,"N "
A,Task,"We've gonna We're going to evaluate it . "
D,Task,"We're gonna go to our other room again . "
D,Minor,"Well comm anyhow . "
D,Elicit,"These are seven factors times seven is forty something . Two ? "
D,Task,"No . "
D,Elicit,"Nine ? "
A,Task,"Forty nine . "
D,Other,"Uh comm minus one . Minus three comm minus four . Minus four . "
D,Task,"So that would be minus eight . "
D,Task,"Forty one out of forty nine . "
A,Task,"Forty one . "
A,Task,"That's Around eighty percent . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"What is it ? "
D,Other,"Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here . "
A,Task,"That's eighty four percent . "
A,Task,"I think that's a pretty nice score . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . 'Kay . So "
D,Task,"that will be the evaluation . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"that brings us to the project evaluation . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Task,"Project process . "
A,Elicit,"Did we move through the right phases comm you think ? Along the process ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But it "
D,Task,"Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . In the design phase . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's right . "
A,Elicit,"So lack of information about prices . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Definitely . "
C,Task,"Yeah . That's true . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh Okay . "
A,Task,"Satisfaction . "
A,Elicit,"Was there room for creativity ? "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"No ? "
D,Task,"Not too much . No . "
A,Task,"It's because of the finance sheet . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm there w there was enough room comm but the finance uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm true . "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"The room was Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And I would've liked to go for the younger users also . "
B,Minor,". "
D,Task,"And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Other,"Restrictions . Internet access . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Leadership . "
A,Elicit,"Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also comm you two of you with the uh last phase ? "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Yes comm was okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Nice . "
C,Task,"The tasks are very structured comm "
C,Task,"so you can just do step by step "
C,Task,"and it's very easy . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"tasks . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ? "
A,Elicit,"Or were they too much ? "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"the smart-board comm the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass comm "
C,Task,"but The digital the digital pen is very nice . "
A,Other,"Smart-board . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"If it wants to download its uh data . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But "
C,Minor,"Yes . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
A,Other,"Failed download . Smart-board was irritating . "
A,Elicit,"So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ? "
C,Task,"A flip-over or a more precise uh digit "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"A flipper's uh easier comm "
B,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Faster as well comm I think . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Flip-over . "
B,Task,"But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation comm it's easier to uh share it with uh other people . "
B,Minor,"Uh so uh "
B,Task,"you can sh save it "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"uh and uh put it on the internet comm or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I tried to open the file on my laptop comm "
B,Minor,"So So "
B,Minor,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"but not possible . "
C,Task,"No . Didn't work . "
B,Other,"No ? "
A,Task,"Uh you need a smart board uh application I think . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"T can uh can you export it uh like a Yeah . "
A,Minor,"But I think you can "
A,Task,"Yeah . Should be possible . Yeah you can export it as image . "
D,Minor,"no . "
A,Minor,"Must "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"must be "
D,Other,"Should've done that then . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"the sharing of the information was uh was okay ? "
B,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Pen is here . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm network . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm pen is here on the table . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm yeah . So "
B,Minor,"you can Uh "
A,Task,"Yeah . It's possible . "
D,Task,"Mm . Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's possible . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"That's nice . "
A,Elicit,"Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ? "
A,Minor,"Or "
B,Minor,"Um comm yeah "
B,Minor,"maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer . Uh comm so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So Yeah . So "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"everybody puts his own score . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And then it mediates the score comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and you can get one "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's better . "
A,Minor,"So that's uh "
A,Other,"How do we call ? Evaluation criteria . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Mm comm "
A,Elicit,"any more ideas ? "
A,Elicit,"Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Because I think then that we get to our last sheet . "
A,Elicit,"Are the costs within the budget ? "
B,Task,"Mm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"They are . "
C,Task,"Considering we are not going to make a docking station . "
A,Minor,"Do we "
A,Other,"Docking station . "
A,Task,"That's a good point . "
B,Minor,". "
A,Elicit,"But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh and I think you can compensate that as well . "
C,Task,"Perhaps . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem comm "
A,Task,"because it's very cheap to make as well . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? "
A,Elicit,"Or what was it ? "
D,Task,"Fifty grand . "
A,Task,"Fifteen fifteen million . "
A,Task,"I think we will . If we gonna export this product . "
A,Task,"It's innovative . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Especially in America . People are pretty decadent . Sometimes . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"still I think "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I mean "
D,Task,"if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . "
A,Task,"You can do more . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Ah . "
D,Task,"So maybe we should just re-focus . "
A,Elicit,"Just put it on the market for everybody . "
A,Task,"You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . "
B,Minor,"Ah . "
D,Task,"Or specifically for younger people . "
B,Minor,"Ah . "
A,Task,"That's one thing you can change it with . "
D,Task,"That's true . "
A,Task,"So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . "
A,Task,"That's I think a good advantage . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is comm than would be with older people . Even if it were their covers . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Uh comm uh then I think we can have our little celebration comm right now . "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"That's it . "
D,Other,"Party party . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think . "
B,Elicit,"Where's the champagne ? "
D,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Task,"I didn't get a message "
A,Minor,"from the from ending of the "
B,Minor,"Uh comm I believe y uh "
A,Minor,"Oh "
D,Minor,"Oh "
A,Task,"I think I have one now . "
D,Task,"you did . "
A,Task,"Five more minutes ? "
A,Task,"Oh that's nice . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Then we still have some questions . "
A,Task,"If somebody has some questions they can ask them now . "
A,Task,"Or we can put these in the project folder as well . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Maybe that's "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Export as picture comm I think . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Hmm . This is another network comm I guess . "
A,Elicit,"Does somebody see the project folder ? "
A,Task,"I don't . "
A,Other,"Hmm . My Documents . "
B,Task,"Uh maybe uh they will save it . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"I'll just put it in My Documents "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it probably will . "
A,Minor,"and uh "
A,Other,"That's okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"I think I'm going to make our final presentation now . "
D,Task,"Oh yeah comm "
D,Task,"you're supposed to make a final "
A,Other,"And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . Summary of the project . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? "
B,Task,"Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Questionnaire . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
A,Task,"I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes comm or something . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Hopefully my pen will download its software . Oh . Or data . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"That'd be nice . "
