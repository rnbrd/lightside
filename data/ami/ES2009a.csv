D,Task,"Are you sure I got it all "
D,Task,"head's kinda small . "
C,Minor,"How're we placed in terms of the "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"alright . "
D,Elicit,"We're okay ? "
B,Other,"Guess I should probably try to sit up straight . "
A,Elicit,"Like that ? "
A,Task,"Okay comm cool . "
D,Elicit,"We're good ? "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"I think mine's fallen off . "
C,Task,"It fell "
C,Task,"That's why . "
D,Task,"I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . "
D,Other,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Uh okay . "
C,Other,"Ah . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Minor,"Right comm so "
A,Other,"I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . "
B,Task,"Wow . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm PowerPoint . "
D,Task,"Very official . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm well comm "
A,Other,"you know comm . "
A,Task,"Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . "
A,Minor,"Right . Um . So "
A,Other,"just to kick off the meeting "
A,Minor,"basically um so "
A,Task,"we're working now for a real reaction comm "
A,Minor,"this is uh so it "
A,Minor,"right . "
A,Other,"Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um "
A,Task,"We're gonna just do a quick opening "
A,Task,"and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another "
A,Task,"um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training . "
A,Task,"Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet comm the whiteboard . "
A,Task,"Um we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this "
A,Task,"and then just a bit of discussion close up . "
A,Minor,"Um I guess you know game or something um in real life "
A,Minor,"um so yeah basically "
A,Minor,"I want to I'm just gonna you got "
A,Task,"of course you can discuss that comm "
A,Task,"I'm thinking about um uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask comm don't tell . "
A,Minor,"Um so um "
A,Task,"if you say something about marketing comm right comm sorted comm "
A,Minor,"um y is "
D,Task,"You're just gonna believe me comm "
D,Task,"we'll go from there . "
A,Task,"Exactly . "
D,Task,"Fair enough . "
A,Minor,"Um I mean "
A,Minor,"obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if I'm "
A,Minor,"like "
A,Task,"we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book "
A,Minor,"you know um "
A,Task,"you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . "
A,Task,"I mean we'll discuss it "
A,Other,"but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like "
D,Task,"Prove it "
D,Other,"yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"yeah yeah exactly "
A,Minor,"so comm "
A,Minor,"'cause we're what "
A,Task,"we're sort of role playing "
A,Minor,"is y g "
A,Minor,"yeah "
A,Task,"you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um . "
A,Task,"And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Task,"have fun comm "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Minor,"maybe you went to "
A,Minor,"um uh you know "
A,Task,"maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ "
A,Task,"but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that comm "
A,Task,"why not comm "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Minor,"you can this is "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Task,"I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . "
A,Elicit,"So are you guys okay with that "
A,Elicit,"does that seem logical ? "
B,Task,"Oh yeah comm that's fine . "
C,Task,"Sure . "
D,Task,"Works for me . "
A,Other,"Sweet . "
A,Other,"Cool . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"I guess that that we're totally "
A,Task,"we're making a remote control "
A,Task,"which is thrilling "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model "
A,Minor,"I dunno if you guys had time to check the "
A,Elicit,"in real life I dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website . "
A,Task,"Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible comm "
A,Task,"that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff "
A,Task,"that nobody really thinks about "
A,Task,"and try to make it nice "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Task,"like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . "
A,Minor,"So um basically "
A,Task,"we are reinventing the wheel "
A,Task,"but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . "
A,Task,"Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . "
A,Task,"And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um um the other designer "
A,Elicit,"that I can't remember comm "
A,Task,"the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ "
A,Task,"right "
A,Task,"um the Industrial Designer "
A,Task,"hey right on alright comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"There you go . "
A,Task,"getting into it um "
A,Task,"to guide me and guide us on this project "
A,Task,"'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Task,"you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . "
A,Task,"And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good comm "
A,Minor,"you know like um "
A,Task,"I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did "
A,Task,"but the idea of um comm yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee "
A,Task,"but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass "
A,Task,"so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand comm or something like that . "
A,Task,"Um and so we'll work up from there "
A,Task,"and um then we'll meet on "
A,Task,"and talk about it "
A,Task,"and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible "
A,Task,"and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go "
A,Task,"take the the the take the basics "
A,Task,"and make it nicer "
A,Task,"and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible "
A,Task,"um to try t of sync it all up . "
A,Task,"So that's the detailed design . "
A,Task,"So it's a three stage kind of thing . "
A,Minor,"Um right so "
A,Task,"for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it comm "
A,Task,"I haven't tried it yet either "
A,Other,"um I'm just gonna start "
A,Other,"and um mm carry like five remotes around "
A,Other,"um and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Task,"if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could comm not all five comm "
A,Task,"if you wanna write all five go for it "
A,Task,"but name one of them that you could um . "
A,Other,"Oh comm "
A,Task,"we skipped introductions . "
A,Other,"Nice . "
A,Other,"I'm a excellent Project Manager . Um . "

A,Other,"Yeah yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Minor,"And so there "
D,Task,"now I can think of so many other ones . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"yeah "
A,Minor,"that's why "
D,Task,"That's how it works . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Other,"Something I miss about my hometown . "
A,Task,"I miss coffee . "
B,Task,"Burritos "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Nice . "
A,Task,"Burritos . "
D,Task,"Oh "
B,Task,"that cost less than eight Pounds . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah "
A,Task,"two two bucks . "
D,Task,"Any thing that are like free . "
A,Elicit,"Where are you from in California by the way ? "
B,Task,"I grew up in San Diego comm "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Elicit,"Did you really ? "
A,Elicit,"What part ? "
B,Minor,"yeah um "
B,Task,"La Jolla comm P_B_ . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"I'm from San Diego as well . "
D,Task,"Nice . "
A,Other,"Yeah oh man . "
B,Task,"But really uh I last lived in San Francisco comm "
B,Minor,"I haven't lived in Cali "
B,Minor,"well "
B,Task,"I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen . "
A,Minor,"Going to s like North Carol "
A,Task,"I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego . "
B,Task,"It's different . "
B,Task,"'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill "
B,Task,"and in northern California they steam them . "
D,Task,"It must make all the difference . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it really does . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"it's it's i "
A,Task,"there's other things too "
A,Minor,"there's "
A,Task,"you just can't place it "
D,Minor,"Ah . "
A,Minor,"like "
A,Task,"I when I went to school in the U_ in Santa Barbara "
A,Task,"which is central California "
A,Task,"the Mexican food is okay comm "
A,Task,"it's just not good "
A,Minor,"like "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"and yeah it's like two bucks comm "
A,Task,"like literally two bucks for this massive "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"I miss "
A,Minor,"yeah "
A,Task,"good call on that . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Where you from in San Diego ? "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego comm "
A,Task,"I live like five minutes from the zoo . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"North Park actually if you want to get real specific . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"my grandparents lived on um thirty second . "
A,Other,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Close t "
B,Elicit,"uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is comm "
A,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"On university comm "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Cafe Forte "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"it's actually like literally half a mile from my house . "
B,Other,"Cool . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"pretty cool . "
A,Task,"Small world "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"as we were discussing before . "
A,Task,"Especially when we're all from the same general region . "
A,Minor,"Right so okay comm "
A,Task,"success on the whiteboard . "
D,Task,"There you go . "
A,Task,"You can harness the awesome power "
B,Other,"Wow . "
A,Task,"a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s "
A,Task,"and things we like about the city "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Minor,"I think we'll "
A,Minor,"Um right so "
A,Task,"moving on to not fun stuff "
A,Task,"uh project finance . "
A,Minor,"Um basically "
A,Task,"what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . Um . "
A,Task,"This is what the finance department has told me comm the C_F_O_ "
A,Task,"but I don't know comm "
A,Task,"I'm not sold on this comm "
A,Task,"it's pretty dear comm "
A,Minor,"I mean "
A,Minor,"twenty f "
A,Task,"that's like you know forty bucks for a remote . "
A,Task,"It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Minor,"what "
A,Task,"we can maybe work on that a later "
A,Task,"but we're gonna make a lot on it comm "
A,Task,"the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . "
A,Task,"Eur internationally . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Task,"something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s "
D,Task,"Makes sense . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Minor,"but um you know "
A,Other,"I'll leave that to you guys "
A,Minor,"but that's something that i i "
A,Task,"it is gonna be an international sold thing . "
A,Task,"Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty . "
A,Task,"So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can . "
A,Minor,"Um s right so um "
A,Task,"just to close up comm "
A,Task,"I'm not sure how much time I've used "
A,Other,"mm next time right Project Manager comm sorted . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Minor,"Is "
A,Task,"uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so "
A,Task,"um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done comm like what the basic function of it . "
A,Task,"Um U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there "
A,Task,"and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . "
A,Minor,"Um mm basic and um so "
A,Task,"I need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want . "
D,Task,"What they're looking for . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have comm "
A,Minor,"you know like uh so "
D,Task,"And negotiate that . Uh . "
A,Task,"yeah well it is "
A,Task,"and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between "
A,Minor,"um so yeah "
A,Task,"specific instructions will be sent in your email . "
A,Task,"But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um "
A,Task,"and as more things come up we'll have meetings "
A,Task,"and you'll get emails and so forth . "
A,Elicit,"Um any questions comm before we get started ? "
C,Elicit,"I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control comm "
C,Elicit,"we can't kind of build it into other uh products . "
A,Minor,"You mean to like "
C,Elicit,"For instance like a mobile phone or something like that . "
B,Task,"Mm . Sounds interesting . "
A,Other,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't think there's any rules about it yet . So "
B,Task,"Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Or or you know can we produ "
C,Elicit,"can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ? "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"have a think about it . "
A,Minor,"I mean "
C,Task,"Yep . Okay . "
A,Minor,"I'm I'm certainly op it seems "
A,Minor,"like yeah "
A,Task,"it it seems like it's certainly do-able "
D,Minor,"W "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"isn't it . "
A,Minor,"I mean um "
A,Task,"or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"The clapper . "
A,Elicit,"No I mean "
A,Minor,"no comm "
A,Task,"good idea comm good idea . "
A,Minor,"We'll see what see what "
B,Task,"Maybe a remote with changeable faces comm like the faces that you can buy for phones . "
D,Task,"I like the little cover thingies . "
C,Task,"Nice . Hot . "
A,Task,"Uh-huh y I like that "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's true comm "
A,Task,"I guess we we probably have some time comm "
A,Task,"maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do comm "
A,Minor,"go back to um I don't really have any . "
A,Other,"Let me bring up something about our basic goals here comm what we want to accomplish . "
A,Other,"Uh project announcement . Ts ts ts "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Not so much . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"All right "
A,Task,"we'll find them comm we're on our own . "
C,Minor,"Now "
C,Elicit,"are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ? "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah "
A,Task,"let's do it comm let's do . "
C,Minor,"S "
C,Elicit,"does anybody have any initial ideas ? "
A,Other,"I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too "
A,Minor,"'cause "
D,Task,"Good idea . Start your minutes . Um "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"I mean oh yeah right . So "
A,Elicit,"initial ideas . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal "
D,Elicit,"right comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"we decided that already "
D,Task,"and it may be functioning for other things comm "
D,Task,"as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do comm like your microwave or your front door "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"or like to have everything on one thing comm "
D,Task,"but then comm I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons comm "
D,Task,"you can't tell what they do . "
B,Task,"S smaller's better . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Simple . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design "
D,Task,"Specific . "
C,Task,"so touch screen design rather than button "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Oh right . "
C,Task,"so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things . "
B,Task,"That'd be different . "
D,Task,"Interesting . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"that's slick "
A,Elicit,"isn't it . "
A,Minor,"I mean like "
A,Task,"stylist "
A,Minor,"yeah like "
A,Minor,"a just a "
D,Task,"True . "
A,Minor,"yeah . Right so "
A,Task,"we got five minutes more to chat about this comm "
A,Task,"perfect . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Task,"we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um uh size and functionality . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Um and we also "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"We want it to be munt multifunctional "
D,Task,"but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Too confusing . "
B,Task,"It's gonna be too complicated comm too crowded with buttons and things . "
A,Other,"I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"of "
A,Minor,"um so you like "
A,Elicit,"maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote ? "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . Possibly . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I don't think one exists . "
D,Task,"An interesting option . "
A,Task,"Be a good idea . "
B,Task,"Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Definitely . "
A,Task,"Yeah all the other universal remotes . "
A,Task,"Um I don't know if there's such a thing out there comm "
A,Task,"I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it "
A,Elicit,"about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL comm N_T_S_C_ comm region one "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"I'm pretty sure there is . "
C,Minor,"I mean "
C,Task,"I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"that he just points at his telev any television he wants "
D,Minor,"That "
C,Task,"and it'll figure out the the specifications of it "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and will control it "
A,Task,"Interesting . "
D,Task,"Awesome . "
C,Minor,"um so "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"I th "
C,Task,"I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um all right . So . "
A,Minor,"I li "
A,Task,"I'm liking that idea comm this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features . Um . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Um . Let's see . "
B,Task,"I think comm making it out of a nice material would be very important comm "
B,Task,"because so many of those remotes that you see comm these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Keeping it nice and slick comm would be important . "
D,Minor,"And "
D,Task,"I don't know comm "
D,Minor,"like comm "
D,Task,"there's such a problem with losing them comm "
D,Task,"that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"so we're gonna have to be careful with what like "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff "
D,Task,"but that would be really cool . "
A,Minor,"Uh let's see . Um . "
C,Task,"I like the idea of the uh multi plate . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Fi b "
C,Minor,"In in "
D,Minor,"like "
D,Elicit,"what are they called comm those face plate things ? "
D,Elicit,"Isn't there a name for them ? "
A,Task,"Think they're just called face plates ? "
D,Elicit,"Are they ? "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Minor,"something comm "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"uh we'll have to come up with a name comm "
C,Task,"I like . "
C,Task,"We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . "
B,Task,"patent it . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Something really cool . "
C,Other,"For those cold winter days . "
D,Task,"Leopard print or something . "
B,Task,"Leopard print . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"I think comm it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device comm "
B,Task,"maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . "
D,Task,"True . "
A,Task,"Mm . But if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote . "
D,Other,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it . "
B,Task,"True . "
C,Task,"If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either "
D,Task,"True . "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"there used to be those whistling devices "
C,Task,"but that's a little bit annoying . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing "
A,Task,"that comes with the remote "
A,Task,"that you could place something else "
A,Task,"that you press "
A,Task,"and it makes the remote page . "
A,Task,"Kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones comm you have a page button and it goes comm "
C,Minor,"Th "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Elicit,"could we do something like that ? "
C,Task,"That's cool . "
B,Task,"I think so . "
D,Task,"Probably . "
C,Task,"I think we could design into that . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Good . "
A,Minor,"Um yeah "
A,Task,"I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of "
A,Task,"um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years comm very much so . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Curves . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We do have the minimum am amount "
A,Minor,"I mean "
A,Task,"we were talking finances "
A,Task,"I dunno comm "
A,Task,"selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote comm twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . "
A,Task,"Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"that's black and you know m massive comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Definitely . "
A,Task,"But um have a think about what we can do comm "
A,Task,"have a think about what we want to do comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"how we're gonna sell it "
A,Minor,"and um "
D,Minor,"Or if you our users in mind comm "
D,Minor,"like "
D,Task,"these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design comm "
D,Minor,"no it's "
D,Task,"they're used to the buttons "
D,Task,"so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
B,Task,"'S true . "
D,Minor,"But "
C,Elicit,"We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ? "
A,Task,"Twenty five Euros . "
D,Task,"Euros . "
C,Task,"Slight difference I guess . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"They're all weaker than "
A,Task,"they're all stronger than the Dollar . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Although comm computer parts comm all "
A,Task,"if you're gonna upgrade your computer comm buy it in the States . "
A,Minor,"Like um "
A,Elicit,"do you guys know Fry's ? Huge computer uh electronics store ? "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"Mm-mm . "
A,Minor,"They serve um right they sa tha s "
A,Task,"they will sell things overseas "
A,Task,"so you can buy stuff in America "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . "
A,Minor,"Right so um "
A,Task,"let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now comm "
A,Other,"I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents comm "
A,Task,"so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas comm you can consult them at your leisure . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"And uh right so "
A,Other,"thanks for that . "
A,Task,"Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about "
A,Minor,"bef uh goi h h getting into . "
D,Elicit,"With half an hour ? "
A,Task,"Um . Yes . "
D,Other,"'Kay . "
D,Other,"Perfect . "
A,Other,"Thanks guys . "
D,Other,"Cool . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Other,"Alright . "
