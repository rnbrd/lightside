Speaker,DialogAct,Text
C,Minor,"Um we are "
C,Task,"So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . "
C,Task,"So switching over I've just left uh my first two screens . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . "
D,Task,"Okay . Cool . "
C,Elicit,"Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that "
C,Elicit,"are particularly bothering you ? "
D,Task,"Mm um . No comm I don't think so . "
C,Minor,"N "
C,Task,"No ? Okay comm cool . "
A,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Hi comm me Raj comm again . "
B,Other,"Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching comm "
B,Task,"uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . "
B,Task,"So we have to look on this . "
B,Task,"First of all methodology . "
B,Minor,"The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way "
B,Task,"We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey comm but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market comm "
B,Task,"because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . "
B,Task,"So what are our findings ? "
B,Minor,"In our "
B,Minor,"uh in our findings we have seen that "
B,Task,"when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good comm "
B,Task,"rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . "
B,Task,"So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . "
B,Minor,"So we should take into uh "
B,Task,"we should consider this factor as the most important factor comm "
B,Task,"because this factor is twice as important comm "
B,Task,"the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . "
B,Task,"So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls . "
D,Elicit,"The last one is the most important one comm is it ? "
B,Task,"No the first one is the "
D,Other,"Oh comm sorry . "
B,Task,"uh the outlook of the mobile comm the it should have a fancy outlook comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"the fancy design "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good comm it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . "
B,Task,"The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . "
B,Task,"We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . "
B,Task,"So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition comm something like that . "
B,Task,"So that indicates our technological advancement . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"like it shouldn't be too much co complicated comm "
B,Task,"there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control comm "
B,Task,"it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . "
B,Minor,"And it should be uh "
B,Task,"and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language comm something . "
B,Task,"So that they could know how to use these remote controls . "
B,Minor,"When we did uh f fashions uh comm recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that "
D,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Elicit,"Ah yeah ? "
D,Task,"I was just reading fruit and vegetables . "
D,Task,"Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . "
B,Task,"Y yeah uh yeah comm "
B,Task,"we have to comm "
B,Task,"because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes comm shoes comm and everything with fruits and vegetables comm "
B,Task,"because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"becoming more and more organic comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"becoming "
A,Other,"We should make a big sponge lemon comm "
A,Task,"and then it'd be it would be yellow . "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Other,"Th that's very good . "
A,Minor,"It's "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So something like that we we should do . "
D,Other,"Glow-in-the-dark . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"And people uh "
B,Task,"the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look comm hard look . "
D,Task,"Well comm that's good . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"That's what we kind of predicted anyway . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So that should also be taken into consideration . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So these are my views . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay comm the spongy comm not real spongy comm "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"you can "
B,Minor,"No it ca y a "
D,Elicit,"Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? "
B,Task,"The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Quite disposable . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also comm "
D,Minor,"Oh okay . "
B,Task,"because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration comm "
C,Minor,"Alright comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"so we don't want to have any harm to the society comm "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"so "
C,Minor,"Fashion . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
C,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
B,Task,"So that's all . "
C,Other,"Fruit and veg comm well there you go . "
C,Other,"Just what I think of when I think of a remote control . "
D,Other,"Mm . "
D,Task,"A remote control ? Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey comm that they said we don't want ? "
B,Task,"S uh we didn't find out any such point . "
D,Minor,"Or was it just "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh yes comm there could be comm but we couldn't find out any comm so "
C,Minor,"Mm-mm-mm-mm . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
C,Minor,"Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . "
D,Elicit,"F_ comm what is it ? Um . "
C,Task,"Function F_ eight . "
D,Elicit,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"No signal . "
B,Task,"Oh no comm . "
D,Elicit,"Is that ? "
A,Task,"No comm it's got it's got it . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm uh yeah comm uh yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Other,"Excuse me . "
D,Elicit,"and then F_ five comm right ? "
C,Task,"Uh comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . Um "
D,Task,"okay comm so the interface concept um . "
D,Task,"Yeah . The interface specification comm "
D,Minor,"what people "
D,Task,"um how they interact with it basically comm I think . "
D,Task,"Um so the method comm we looked at existing designs comm "
D,Minor,"what are the "
D,Task,"what's good about them comm what's bad about them comm "
D,Task,"um I looked at their flaws comm "
D,Task,"so we're going to look at their flaws comm everything . "
D,Task,"Um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good comm "
D,Task,"so a bit of imagination . "
C,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
D,Task,"Uh the findings comm I've got some pictures to show you as well . "
C,Other,"either . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Okay comm so most remote controls use graphical interface comm "
D,Task,"where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . "
C,Minor,"Uh okay . "
D,Task,"Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout comm which makes it confusing . "
D,Task,"So I think for our remote control "
D,Task,"There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls comm "
D,Task,"but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons "
D,Task,"like the the top right for on and off or something comm "
D,Task,"I think comm people find that importantcomm'cause then it's easy to use . "
C,Task,"Right comm okay . Yeah . "
D,Other,"And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . "
D,Elicit,"Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just "
C,Minor,"Excellent . "
C,Task,"Uh no just escape "
D,Task,"Escape comm okay . "
C,Minor,"should uh "
D,Task,"Um comm oh I still haven't got my glasses on . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones . "
A,Other,"Wow . "
D,Other,"I'll just walk you through them . "
D,Task,"This one is a voice recognition . "
D,Task,"And that's the kind of idea we're going for . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"Looks pretty complicated . "
D,Task,"There's um an L_C_D_ thing comm "
D,Minor,"which we thought could "
D,Task,"I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . "
C,Minor,"Right comm okay . "
D,Task,"This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse comm "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm comm like the middle button . "
D,Minor,"which "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Um and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that comm "
D,Minor,"like would the computer come "
C,Task,"Ah it's kinda like scrolling "
C,Minor,"uh right comm well comm "
C,Task,"if I s if I'm thinking of the right one comm I've got the same thing in front of my monitor comm "
C,Task,"you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require comm you press the middle of the scroll . "
D,Task,"Uh-huh comm that's like the L_C_D_ one comm "
D,Elicit,"is it ? "
C,Task,"Right comm okay . "
D,Task,"But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . "
D,Task,"But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm presumably . "
D,Task,"I think that's what that is . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So these are just a few ideas . "
D,Task,"Again that's just quite boring shape comm grey comm "
D,Task,"looks quite space-agey comm but too many buttons comm I think on that one . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . "
A,Task,"Uh it looks threatening . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it does look kind of dangerous . "
A,Minor,"It looks like "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Um this one I thought was really cool . "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Task,"It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . "
D,Task,"You can put it in there comm "
D,Task,"it's for your kids comm "
D,Task,"and it's quite an organic shape "
D,Task,"and the little circle around there is pretty cool . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And that's really easy to use comm bright comm "
D,Task,"so I like this one lot for our design . "
D,Task,"I think something like that would be good . "
A,Minor,"Wow . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um comm I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . "
D,Task,"Of course yellow . "
D,Task,"Right comm yeah . "
C,Task,"So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . "
D,Task,"And this one comm the over-sized one comm "
D,Task,"I don't know about you comm but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . "
D,Task,"I don't think that will sell very well . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something comm is it ? "
D,Task,"I guess so . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Minor,"I think that's a bit "
C,Task,"Strange . "
A,Task,"Then d blind don't watch T_V_ . "
D,Task,"Yeah exactly . "
C,Task,"No they do comm they do . "
C,Task,"They listen to it . Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"They do ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"And um this one is just pointing out . "
D,Task,"I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything comm "
D,Task,"but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down comm but it would actually go up comm because of the shape . "
C,Minor,"Right comm okay . "
D,Minor,"So that could "
D,Task,"that's a bit confusing . "
D,Minor,"Um but the buttons on this I think are "
D,Task,"it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . "
D,Task,"They don't have to be all the same . "
D,Task,"So that's quite cool . Um . "
C,Minor,"'Kay "
C,Task,"but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway comm don't they ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm exactly . "
D,Other,"Um F_ five . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"So there are some of the findings . "
D,Task,"So we need to combine those ones um "
D,Task,"and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . "
C,Task,"Brilliant . "
C,Task,"That's handy . "
D,Task,"Um yeah it is comm just in time comm very handy . "
D,Minor,"Um so "
D,Task,"I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . "
D,Minor,"It's "
D,Task,"you program it like you say comm record comm um and then comm play comm and then comm record comm play machine comm and stuff like that comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"so that's "
D,Minor,"And it's much "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So that's quite cool . "
D,Task,"Uh personal preferences just some imagination comm "
D,Task,"the raised symbols I thought were good comm "
D,Task,"the L_C_D_ comm it does look smart comm but I think maybe for our budget comm "
D,Elicit,"do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the "
A,Elicit,"The L_C_D_ "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"and the other stuff "
A,Minor,"uh comm I think . "
D,Task,"And the speech recognition comm "
D,Task,"'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition comm "
D,Elicit,"are we ? "
B,Task,"But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more comm "
B,Task,"but they want the quality comm they want f fancy look comm they want some new design comm something new . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Uh-huh . But our budget comm we've "
B,Task,"Uh yeah . "
C,Task,"It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty comm you know . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So even if we increase our cost little bit comm within uh some limits comm and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook comm I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost comm . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Ben bana "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I can't see tha "
C,Task,"Although comm th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now comm "
D,Minor,"The L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything "
C,Minor,"so maybe the small "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But I mean like I I the black and white comm I guess comm it just doesn't look funky enough . "
D,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"Um but comm I mean comm like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens comm "
C,Minor,"w I ju I mean "
D,Minor,"Yeah . S "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"I wouldn't know about the costs of them . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Elicit,"But uh price price not withstanding um comm is it too complicated comm is it gonna be too much just overload ? "
C,Other,"Twelve fifty . "
B,Minor,"And the "
B,Task,"Uh i it will be easy because there will be comm on L_C_D_ s screen comm there will be different frent icons comm they can just click ok okay comm whatever they wa "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's the thing comm "
D,Minor,"because "
C,Task,"Possibly . "
A,Task,"But but the thing is when you use a remote control comm you never look at it comm "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You're looking at the T_V_ "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"and and it's uh "
D,Task,"That's true comm yeah . "
A,Task,"It just seems kind of like a a needless th "
D,Task,"And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use comm so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"It's a it's great comm it's a good idea comm "
D,Task,"but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use comm it's not the thing we should go for comm I think . "
D,Task,"Child-friendly comm I thought this was good comm "
D,Task,"as you pointed out the um "
D,Task,"the bit comm it often goes missing especially with children comm "
D,Task,"but it's a good shape "
D,Minor,"and the organic is kind of "
D,Task,"we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape comm I think . "
A,Elicit,"So which vegetable ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well I mean we could make a "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I know comm carrot . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Well comm si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours comm I think your lemon wasn't that far s "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"The the lemon . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Well what are the options ? "
C,Task,"And if it doesn't work you know comm we've just made a lemon . "
D,Minor,"But we don't want it to be "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um the child-friendly comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Easy to use comm it seems quite easy to use . "
D,Task,"I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I think that's a good idea to go for . "
C,Task,"I like I like the colourful buttons as well . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And the mouse one comm I thought it was a good idea comm "
D,Task,"because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . Um . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so most people "
C,Task,"will have come in contact with that kind of use . "
D,Task,"S yeah . "
D,Task,"So they'd be able to use that um comm "
D,Task,"as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um so there you go . "
C,Task,"And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker comm so "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"So that's um the user interface "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"design . "
D,Other,"So okay comm I'll take this out now then . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
D,Other,"There you go . "
A,Task,"I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm looks like it . "
A,Other,"and I'll I'll give you the uh comm I guess comm technical considerations for those . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Other,"And I'm gonna use the whiteboard comm "
A,Task,"just 'cause we haven't used it . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I was just thinking the self same thing . "
A,Minor,"Right . So comm "
A,Task,"the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls comm see how they work comm "
A,Task,"uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it comm "
A,Task,"and then we'll throw in our new innovations um "
A,Task,"and keep it all within budget . "
A,Task,"So uh yeah comm looking inside a a very simple remote control . "
C,Other,"Magic man . "
A,Task,"Um this is what they sent me . "
A,Task,"'Kay . Here's uh the competition comm I suppose . "
A,Task,"Um you open it up comm there's a circuit board inside comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"um "
A,Task,"and there's a a chip comm a processor comm "
A,Task,"the T_A_ one one eight three five comm which um receives input from the buttons comm "
C,Elicit,"So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip comm is it ? "
A,Minor,"and ch "
A,Task,"Right comm "
A,Minor,"it's very "
A,Task,"they're very cheap remote . "
A,Task,"This remote costs nothing comm you know . "
A,Task,"Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier comm "
A,Task,"which is made of some transistors and amplifiers comm op-amps comm "
A,Task,"and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light comm "
A,Task,"which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . "
A,Task,"Oh here it is . "
A,Task,"Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control comm "
A,Minor,"because it it defines the uh "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? "
A,Task,"R Um no comm I mean this is a very old one comm so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . "
C,Minor,"They gotta be "
C,Task,"Almost a key-ring . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"So this is what we need to have for certain . "
A,Task,"Um . So you know comm as we said comm we got the outer casing comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"which we have to decide comm you know comm what's it gonna be comm "
A,Task,"um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up comm "
A,Task,"processor comm um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had comm "
A,Task,"amplifier and transmitter are all standard . "
A,Task,"Um so for the casing comm uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team "
A,Task,"uh comm you know comm we have a bunch of options from wood comm titanium comm rubber comm plastic comm whatnot comm "
A,Task,"um latex comm double-curved comm curved . "
A,Task,"So lots of choices comm "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"what do we think ? "
A,Task,"Uh or sponge comm I guess comm isn't on there comm right . "
C,Minor,"Well . "
D,Task,"Mm . I'm not sure about the sponge . "
A,Task,"Organic sponge . "
C,Task,"Well comm I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it comm "
C,Elicit,"doesn't it . "
C,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Uh yeah comm it's very elasticy for sure . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And that would k also give it kinda durability "
C,Minor,"and "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
C,Task,"and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"so "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? "
A,Task,"Okay so comm here are a a plastic comm "
A,Task,"uh latex "
D,Task,"I like the rubber comm the stress balls comm I think comm "
D,Task,"you know comm that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and "
C,Task,"Oh right comm okay . "
A,Task,"Oh right . "
C,Task,"I don't know what that stuff is . "
A,Task,"So something with give to it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . "
A,Minor,"And "
A,Elicit,"and the colour is yellow comm right ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Or at least incorporating comm yeah . "
D,Task,"y yellow incorporated comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yellow comm okay . Um . "
C,Minor,"I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh "
C,Task,"I don't know what other standard silver kind of "
D,Minor,"I think "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Other parts or uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm the buttons "
D,Task,"w like comm 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"or i if we're having buttons actually comm "
A,Minor,"Mm' kay . "
A,Task,"So yellow for the body comm "
D,Minor,"I don "
C,Minor,"Um . "
A,Elicit,"and then what colour for the buttons ? "
C,Task,"Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So multi-coloured buttons . "
D,Task,"You do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red comm and stuff like that comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish comm perhaps . "
D,Task,"Makes it easy to use . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's true comm "
D,Task,"because that blue one did look quite hardish . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . "
C,Task,"I mean if we are gonna make it a novel "
C,Task,"I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . Yeah . "
C,Task,"a bit comfier comm you know . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go Um how exactly ? "
A,Task,"Maybe double "
D,Task,"Like uh an hour glass kind of figure comm "
D,Elicit,"is that what you're thinking of comm "
D,Minor,"or just like a "
C,Task,"Yeah it's uh comm yeah comm that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold comm easy to hold so you don't drop it . "
D,Minor,"It's not "
A,Task,"What about a banana ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"We could make novelty remote controls . "
A,Task,"Okay comm like we could have a big banana shaped remote control comm "
C,Task,"Well comm yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I mean like "
A,Task,"'cause it's yellow fruit comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"But then how would you point it ? "
B,Other,"Ah "
B,Minor,"yeah . Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"How would you point it ? "
A,Task,"Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point comm I guess . "
D,Minor,"What "
A,Task,"We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . "
C,Task,"They only cost pennies . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I appreciate this idea comm "
B,Task,"because then this this will help us in our advertisement also "
B,Task,"and we can relate with fruits and vegetables comm the people's choices . "
B,Task,"That what our data shows that comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"so this w this w "
C,Other,"Huh ? "
D,Task,"y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . "
A,Task,"So a spongy banana re "
C,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"Rubber banana . "
C,Minor,"I mean that that th "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"does "
C,Task,"it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm okay . "
D,Task,"I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . "
D,Elicit,"And what else did you say about fashions ? "
D,Elicit,"What was trendy ? "
B,Task,"Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables comm "
C,Minor,"S "
A,Minor,"See "
B,Minor,"like people uh now "
C,Task,"And sponginess . "
D,Task,"And spongy comm yeah . "
A,Task,"So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable "
B,Task,"Spongy . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"like so it would have a stem perhaps "
A,Minor,"and a "
D,Task,"Maybe comm yeah . "
A,Task,"maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
D,Elicit,"Like what's what's that comm "
D,Task,"I don't even know the name of it comm "
D,Task,"some kind of comm you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . "
D,Task,"I don't know the name of that . "
A,Elicit,"So it'd look like this kinda . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's what I was thinking . "
A,Elicit,"Like a gourd almost comm or a squash of some sort ? "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm maybe that's what they are . "
D,Task,"'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit "
D,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say comm you know comm it transmits from this end . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm why the hell not . "
C,Minor,"Let's "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
C,Task,"that'll make us fifty million Euros . "
D,Elicit,"What do you guy What do you think ? "
C,Minor,"Um . Well comm "
C,Minor,"I guess it's kind of dra uh "
C,Task,"you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape comm "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"yeah ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm then only we can relate it with something . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we can relate it by advertising or "
B,Task,"Yeah . Exactly . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm so double-curved comm single-curved comm what do we feel ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or we can do something comm we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey comm let the public choose what they want . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"There's a good man . There's a good idea . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay um comm I guess comm since you're the marketing guy . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm sure . I will be happy to do that . "
A,Minor,"We'll uh "
A,Task,"Okay comm we could do that . Um . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"And buttons would comm did we say ? Uh different shapes of buttons ? "
C,Minor,"Um I l I su "
C,Task,"I mean for the specific functions comm you know comm up and down comm uh play comm stop . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
C,Task,"They've got comm I mean comm they've got standard sort of intuitive um "
A,Task,"so buttons . "
C,Task,"things that are always used . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm just like that . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's cool . "
C,Task,"I like it . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
A,Elicit,"With the scroll-wheel or no ? "
D,Elicit,"Yeah comm what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? "
C,Task,"Uh speech recognition comm I think comm "
C,Task,"so we need a microphone presumably . "
A,Task,"Okay "
A,Other,"uh I could put the microphone here . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay there's the microphone . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Where should I put the microphone ? "
C,Minor,"I mean ho h h wel "
C,Elicit,"are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I'm not sure . "
D,Task,"Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration comm I think . "
C,Task,"Glad comm we're not doing this for real . "
D,Minor,"Um yeah comm I can "
D,Task,"no I'm not sure . "
A,Task,"Okay comm well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels comm right ? "
D,Minor,"I couldn "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or "
C,Task,"I would put it sort of sub-centrally comm so it's "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Kay there's the mic . "
C,Task,"So it can be sort of held and w "
D,Task,"That's cool . "
C,Task,"We really need really gonna need to hold it comm if it's gonna be voice recognition . "
A,Minor,"Um n well we can "
A,Other,"Whoops . "
C,Other,"Oops . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"So let's not use the whiteboard any more . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
C,Other,"Upsidaisy . "
A,Other,"Oops comm sorry . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"And uh so what else was there ? "
D,Minor,"Um the "
D,Elicit,"What about the glow-in-the-dark thing comm the strip around it ? "
D,Elicit,"Are we just gonna leave that ? "
C,Task,"I s I still like it . "
C,Task,"Um but that's me . "
D,Task,"You still like it . "
D,Task,"'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Yes comm or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . "
C,Task,"I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . "
D,Minor,"'Cause um it could "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Um don't wanna sort of overkill . "
D,Task,"Especially with yellow . "
D,Task,"Mm . I dunno . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"'Cause I mean like uh if we "
C,Elicit,"I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? "
C,Elicit,"Do we want to go for buttons at all comm "
C,Task,"do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? "
D,Elicit,"Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"you know comm and then you just tal "
A,Minor,"They can work from a "
C,Task,"I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . "
A,Task,"You don't have to hold it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers comm "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"you know they have uh fruits all round them . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Make them make them think of fruit comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Now just make sure they don't eat the remote . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I mean uh some uh I "
D,Elicit,"Yeah comm do we need buttons ? "
C,Task,"l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh comm I dunno comm an apple . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Then it's just apple so sort of "
C,Task,"Uh comm yellow apples though Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that comm "
D,Task,"uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Okay comm yeah comm that's good . "
C,Task,"Groovy . "
A,Minor,"Okay . But yeah "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm . "
A,Task,"But yeah comm about the speech thing comm it doesn't have to be hand held or close . "
A,Task,"It can sit at a distance and pick it up still . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So I mean like you could actually "
C,Task,"Yeah comm gives you the options . "
B,Minor,"Or we can "
B,Task,"we can do one thing comm "
B,Task,"we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes comm "
B,Task,"different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So whatever people want comm like if somebody want it in banana shape comm we will put that casing onto that mobile phone comm okay comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So a selection of casings . "
B,Minor,"it will look l "
B,Task,"Uh yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"In that w "
C,Task,"It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um "
D,Task,"'cause you said about disposable comm "
D,Elicit,"didn't you ? "
B,Other,"S s sorry ? "
D,Task,"You said about disposable earli people want disposable things "
D,Task,"so we could do that comm like have a choice . "
B,Task,"Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of comm we need not to have a full cover comm we will just have a half of cover comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"okay ? "
C,Task,"Like like mobiles comm yeah . "
B,Task,"If somebody wants it i in banana shape comm we will fit banana shape casing onto that comm so it will give a banana shape look . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that comm we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . "
B,Task,"It will give apple shape look . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So in that way you can have any comm that means whatever you want comm "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"without uh yeah . "
D,Task,"We still need the buttons in the same places thought comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"don't we ? "
B,Task,"button will be on the upper side comm buttons will be the on the upper side . "
C,Task,"You can standardise those comm "
C,Minor,"I mean . "
D,Task,"Oh comm that's the other side . Oh comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm buttons will be on the upper side comm lower side we will just put the casing comm "
B,Task,"so half of that will be look the "
D,Task,"Oh comm half a fruit . Oh comm okay comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm not not the upper side . "
B,Minor,"So from lower you can comm "
B,Task,"it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look comm whatever . "
D,Task,"Okay comm okay . "
B,Task,"So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything comm we will just design casings fruit shape . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons comm "
B,Minor,"And "
C,Minor,"'cause when "
C,Task,"if you think about it if they're wanting it comm 'cause they want to look at it comm if they're using it comm and what they want to look at is facing away from them . It doesn't really "
D,Minor,"Mm mm . "
C,Task,"You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side comm and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . "
C,Task,"And you've got the facia comm and you can just talk at the "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Maybe . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm um so "
C,Task,"So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"s I guess we decided on material comm "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and the colours we got down comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and the shape comm maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well comm um because "
D,Task,"Well comm I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing comm "
D,Task,"because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit "
D,Minor,"and uh because what "
C,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"so we stick with what we've got there . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"w I think wh wha would "
D,Task,"we're trying to get to twenty five comm thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . "
D,Task,"They wanted something that looks fancy "
D,Task,"and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick comm "
D,Task,"but something ergonomically shaped and organic comm like good to hold comm based on fruits and natural things like that comm "
C,Task,"Mm 'kay . "
D,Task,"because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow comm you know . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I mean we could make it nice pale yellow . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Well comm it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So again I mean like we could have comm uh I mean comm we could quite easily have the the main body be a different "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with comm you said comm the logan the slogan . "
C,Minor,"colour comm but have "
C,Task,"kinda going round comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Because "
C,Minor,"Um I mean e even if "
C,Task,"I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour comm "
C,Task,"so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"W sort of "
A,Task,"Great . "
A,Task,"Um as for the energy source um comm you know comm almost every remote control uses just batteries comm "
A,Task,"but we don't have to be limited by that . "
A,Task,"We can use a hand-dynamo . "
A,Task,"Um I don't know what that means comm "
C,Task,"Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it comm it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . "
A,Elicit,"we crank it ? "
A,Task,"Right comm it's like those watches that you c "
C,Task,"Uh yeah . "
A,Task,"So comm this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab comm you can shake it if it's out of power . "
D,Elicit,"Oh comm a d a dynamo ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm like with those watches that you kind of twist . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I like that comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's quite cool . "
A,Task,"Okay . So if it if it's not working comm I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"You shake it and scream at it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo comm tha these type of cells ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it is comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Because then people have to comm well like if the cell is out of bat "
C,Task,"It does leave them with an obligation to "
B,Task,"Yeah comm to "
C,Task,"Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . "
B,Minor,"mo Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Then if it's just sitting on the "
B,Minor,"because most of the people "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay comm okay . "
D,Task,"That's true . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Right um what are the other options ? "
A,Task,"Uh there's solar power . Um . "
B,Task,"Uh comm solar power will w also not be a good idea comm "
B,Task,"because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and the days when there is no sola sunlight "
C,Task,"I'm I'm with uh Raj on that comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I think comm you know comm "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so probably just "
C,Task,"I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house comm there's not really ever sun coming in my window . "
B,Minor,"What we w "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Elicit,"But w like just normal light ? "
B,Task,"I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . "
C,Task,"Oh that's true . "
B,Task,"They can they can recharge it . "
C,Minor,"I mean I w I w uh "
C,Task,"that idea that I thought "
C,Task,"um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And we're a very environmentally friendly company comm aren't we as well ? "
C,Task,"is having a comm "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"having a rechargeable stand comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so that not only it doubles as a stand comm but um for using it as uh recharging it comm but also for using it as sound recognition . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Like like a hand "
D,Task,"like one of those portable phones kind of thing . "
C,Task,"Yeah that kind of thing . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's Yeah comm exactly . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So uh a rechargeable battery . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Rechargeable . "
A,Task,"Um the user interface comm the buttons comm I guess we talked about this already . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,". What's chip on print ? "
A,Minor,"Um . "
C,Minor,"What's "
A,Other,"Hmm ? "
C,Task,"Sorry comm never mind . "
A,Minor,"Uh th the uh "
A,Task,"the electronics um comm basically the more features we add um "
A,Other,"Oops comm this one . "
A,Task,"So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"which adds to the cost as you can expect . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"But uh I think we can keep it all under budget . "
A,Minor,"So uh yes comm "
A,Task,"so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So just in time . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"Just in time . "
C,Task,"and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . "
A,Task,"Right comm right . "
C,Task,"That's good . "
C,Other,"Uh woah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Okay comm we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um "
A,Task,"and keeping the L_C_D_ screen out . "
C,Other,"Excuse m "
C,Task,"I've just deleted that whole thing . "
C,Task,"Um we're kind of running out of time comm "
C,Task,"so if you could "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Elicit,"Was that you ? "
C,Elicit,"Um that was your bit's covered comm "
A,Other,"Huh ? "
C,Task,"I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah that was that was it . "
B,Other,"Uh excuse me comm Bri "
C,Task,"Um comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So control F_ eight comm right ? "
C,Task,"Oh comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm mine seems to have turned off . "
D,Task,"I can't do anything . "
C,Elicit,"And I just touch the pad . "
B,Task,"You just touch the pad comm yeah . "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No ? "
C,Task,"It's actually shut down . "
D,Task,"It's on comm but there's nothing on the screen . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm um now what we have "
A,Task,"Try uh flipping the screen down . "
C,Task,"uh our next meeting's in half an hour "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . "
A,Other,"Oh comm "
A,Elicit,"I get to do it comm too . "
C,Task,"Yeah . It's you guys . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
A,Task,"Oh neat . "
C,Task,"So um comm you know I mean comm luckily we chose a nice simple shape . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . Save everything to the shared documents comm is that right ? "
B,Task,"That's great . "
C,Task,"Uh yeah comm "
C,Task,"I hope I can recover this comm 'cause I've accidentally deleted it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Which doesn't really help me much . "
D,Task,"I think comm I've saved mine already . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm can you save that uh send that last one again comm please comm Raj comm "
C,Task,"as I still can't find it on the "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh it was under a different name . "
B,Other,"I will show you comm "
B,Task,"in shared documents . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh working components . "
B,Task,"Oh comm you didn't get that . "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Other,"I will send new . "
C,Other,"Okay comm thank you . "
B,Other,"Uh I'll put it in shared documents comm again . "
C,Task,"Um yeah comm Project comm Project Documents . "
B,Other,"Project documents comm "
B,Other,"sorry comm "
B,Task,"I put it in the shared documents . "
C,Task,"Uh right comm "
C,Minor,"that's that's the that "
B,Task,"Uh yeah . "
C,Task,"it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . "
C,Task,"Project Documents is on the um desktop . "
B,Task,"Right comm that's great . "
B,Task,"But I cou can't open that comm because it w asks uh for some username or password . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
C,Elicit,"Really ? "
B,Other,"I'll show you . "
A,Task,"Uh these lapel mics are trouble . "
B,Minor,"Ts "
C,Task,"Oh right comm "
C,Minor,"I think um "
C,Other,"Hold on . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm I don't know if y "
C,Task,"it it just ca it just came up on my um "
C,Task,"on my agenda . "
C,Minor,"S Um "
C,Task,"presumably there's clay somewhere . "
C,Task,"Um . "
C,Other,"Four . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's great . "
C,Other,"Whoops . "
C,Task,"Light comm light comm please . Light . "
C,Task,"Right comm there you go . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm th thank you . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm quite . "
C,Task,"And we're using this our basic chip set comm "
C,Task,"so it's all good . "
B,Other,"Oh sorry . "
A,Elicit,"Are we done with our meeting ? "
B,Other,"Uh excuse me comm Brian . "
C,Task,"Um I think we're almost done comm yeah . "
B,Task,"You have to keep your pen separate comm because I used your pen . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Oh oops . "
C,Other,"Sorry man . "
B,Minor,"S "
C,Task,"Uh okay comm still didn't manage to get down all the last bits "
C,Task,"so we had rechargeable and Uh . Apples . "
C,Minor,"Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . "
C,Other,"'Kay comm so we came up with that comm that's okay . "
C,Elicit,"What's supplements ? "
C,Other,"Supplements . "
C,Minor,"Uh uh . "
C,Task,"See . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
D,Task,"Fun . "
C,Task,"I shoulda something like that . "
C,Task,"If I kn see I I knew that . "
C,Other,"I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Other,"Just for cruelty . "
D,Other,"Yeah . Star fruit . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Elicit,"I wonder if they mean like literally make it comm sort of buttons and everything . "
B,Minor,"So sh should "
