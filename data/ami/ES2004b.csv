B,Other,"Help . "
B,Other,"It's up there ? That screen's black . "
B,Other,"Alright comm okay . Okay comm that's fine . "
D,Other,"Oh God . "
B,Other,"Are we done ? "
B,Minor,"Right comm okay um comm "
B,Task,"this is our second meeting "
B,Task,"and I might be a bit all over the place . "
B,Other,"Um comm right our agenda for today comm "
B,Elicit,"do you want us to give you a second ? "
D,Task,"Uh comm no that's okay comm "
D,Other,"sorry . "
B,Task,"Okay comm um "
B,Other,"I'll go over what we decided last meeting comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"um comm "
B,Task,"we decided upon a universal control comm one handset for all comm T_V_ comm video equipment . "
A,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Task,"Um comm that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers comm wide age range comm not limiting anyone . "
B,Task,"We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product comm we put fashion in electronics comm you know that kind of s thing . "
B,Minor,"Um comm our budget would have to affect um "
B,Task,"try not to reflect our budget comm um that we might have a bit of oh oh you can see it comm okay . Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . "
B,Task,"Um want it to look uncluttered comm "
B,Task,"undaunting to the customer . "
B,Task,"We discussed a flip-open design comm "
B,Task,"um reducing the size of the control "
B,Task,"and an electronic panel um for further features like programming comm things like that . "
B,Minor,"Okay . Um comm "
B,Task,"three presentations comm I've got written here so "
B,Elicit,"shall we hear from Marketing first ? "
D,Other,"Um is it okay if I postpone that til later comm "
D,Task,"I just want to get access to a little bit more information comm "
B,Unlab,"No that's fine comm that's fine . "
D,Elicit,"is that okay ? "
C,Other,"Okay comm yeah I'll go first . "
C,Elicit,"Can I grab the "
B,Task,"Unplug me . "
C,Other,"Thanks . "
C,Elicit,"What do I have to press ? "
C,Task,"Oh comm F_ eight ? "
B,Task,"Um comm F_N_ function F_ eight . "
C,Task,"Oh right comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Maybe "
A,Task,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Yep there we go . "
C,Task,"Okay this is uh the working design comm "
C,Task,"presented by me comm the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire . "
C,Task,"'Kay comm this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . "
C,Task,"What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ? "
C,Task,"Well comm a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state comm "
C,Task,"whether that be the power comm or the channel um or the volume comm everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . "
C,Task,"Um comm so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed "
C,Task,"and try and take some inspiration from that . "
C,Task,"But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people comm we wanna make sure that our design stands out "
C,Task,"and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area "
C,Task,"because I'm dealing with the inside really . "
C,Other,"So um comm yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one . "
C,Task,"Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ "
C,Task,"presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use comm wireless "
C,Task,"and comm you don't need to send very much information . "
C,Task,"Um comm most of them are powered by some form of battery . "
C,Task,"Now our one comm I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue "
C,Task,"because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries "
C,Task,"but those can be quite bulky "
C,Task,"so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"Could I can I interject to ask a question there comm "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah sure . "
D,Elicit,"is that appropriate ? "
D,Elicit,"You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? "
C,Task,"Um no no comm "
C,Task,"if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky "
C,Task,"and that's because of the size of the batteries comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . "
D,Minor,"Right comm "
D,Elicit,"the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not comm right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"the the "
B,Task,"They are . "
C,Task,"well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Oh I see . "
C,Task,"but I'm just wondering about power consumption "
C,Task,"and how much you need to send the data across . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um comm and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . "
C,Task,"Um comm now the ones at the moment are small "
C,Task,"but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . "
C,Task,"Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries "
C,Task,"'cause otherwise it's not gonna work comm "
C,Task,"uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose comm we can uh discuss that later "
C,Task,"and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller "
C,Task,"Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres "
C,Task,"which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ "
C,Task,"unless they're in a cinema comm which not most people do "
C,Task,"so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . "
C,Task,"And then I was uh just had a quick look at the external design "
C,Task,"but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . "
C,Task,"And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . "
C,Task,"It's not a proper circuit comm "
C,Task,"I'm not sure if it'd work or not comm "
C,Task,"I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway comm "
C,Task,"we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um "
C,Task,"which would basically comm when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver comm "
C,Task,"which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using "
C,Task,"and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared "
C,Task,"because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . "
C,Task,"And then finally comm um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost "
C,Task,"so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost "
C,Task,"so that that should be good . "
C,Task,"Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base comm "
C,Task,"we were talking about it before "
C,Task,"and also just something that I was thinking about comm uh "
C,Task,"because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I th that was just sort of a general point there . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"And that's uh yeah . "
D,Task,"That's a very important part comm "
D,Task,"it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that comm whenever you like me to present . "
C,Task,"Alright okay comm "
C,Task,"and yeah comm that's that's what I came up with there comm "
C,Task,"so if you wanna "
B,Other,"Okay comm thank you very much . "
B,Elicit,"Um comm would you like to continue on from that ? "
A,Other,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Ooh . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"Or comm maybe move the laptop over . "
A,Minor,"It can be "
A,Task,"okay comm that's okay with me . "
A,Minor,"further . "
A,Minor,"Oops . "
A,Elicit,"Why's it not working ? "
A,Elicit,"F_ eight comm right ? "
B,Task,"F_ function . "
C,Task,"Function F_ eight yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Mm why's it in the right ? "
D,Minor,"No . "
D,Task,"The plug hasn't come out at the bottom comm has it ? No . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's connecting . "
C,Task,"No comm no "
C,Minor,"yeah it's just . "
D,Other,"Meter adjusting . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm there . "
A,Minor,"okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting comm just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that "
A,Task,"and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing "
A,Task,"because um comm I haven't had some marketing data "
A,Task,"and basically every product is marketable . "
A,Task,"So purpose comm as William already said comm I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ "
A,Task,"to make make it as simple as possible . "
A,Task,"And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use comm rather than having a lot of complex button "
A,Task,"because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons "
A,Task,"and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . "
A,Task,"But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it comm "
A,Task,"will this two features together . "
A,Task,"So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The "
A,Task,"main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top "
A,Task,"and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever comm can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . "
A,Task,"So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience "
A,Task,"and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body "
A,Task,"and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . "
A,Task,"Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls "
A,Task,"because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons "
A,Task,"so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . "
A,Task,"As we saw we we have to make a profit also "
A,Task,"so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production "
A,Elicit,"mm by fifty million we said ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also comm "
A,Task,"so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . "
A,Minor,"Um comm that's so this is "
A,Task,"if you ask me personally comm I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design "
A,Task,"and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard "
A,Task,"because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"Uh any comments like comm if you want ? "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"Um comm I think we'll chat about it at the end comm "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end comm um "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"Yeah sure . "
B,Other,"Ooh comm it's vibrating comm that's strange . "
B,Other,"Oh comm God . "
B,Minor,"Right comm okay . "
D,Elicit,"Have I got to keep this here ? "
A,Task,"I think you'll have to "
A,Minor,"You can't "
D,Elicit,"Does it matter ? "
A,Minor,"It'll have to "
A,Task,"this can't be pulled . "
D,Task,"I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ? "
B,Task,"We just do the best we can . "
D,Other,"Uh comm whoops . "
A,Task,"You'll have to push it a bit more . "
D,Elicit,"Will it manage ? "
D,Elicit,"Bit more comm "
D,Other,"oh dear . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Yeah this is more than enough . "
C,Other,"There we go comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I've got a bit more of the cable . "
D,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Other,"There we go . "
D,Elicit,"Is that okay ? "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"I think you can pull it out now . "
D,Other,"Thank you comm "
D,Other,"just pull it closer a little bit . "
C,Minor,"Uh you should be able to and "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you might . "
D,Task,"Get it right over comm "
C,Task,"yeah comm there you go . "
D,Other,"okay comm thank you . "
B,Minor,"Ah . "
B,Task,"Look at that . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm um comm "
D,Task,"I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view "
D,Task,"and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . "
D,Task,"Um comm so that's where we started comm "
D,Task,"we used our our usability lab comm the company's usability lab comm "
D,Task,"we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public comm "
D,Task,"male and female comm "
D,Task,"all age groups from fifteen upwards "
D,Task,"and um we observed them in the lab comm "
D,Task,"just their general use of the remote control comm "
D,Task,"you can see we had a hundred subjects there . "
D,Task,"Our findings comm lots of findings comm "
D,Task,"I've just summarised some of them here . "
D,Task,"The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls comm "
D,Task,"so it has obvious design implications there . "
D,Task,"Um comm we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . "
D,Task,"Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy comm "
D,Task,"we were quite surprised by that finding comm "
D,Task,"but um that's quite a high proportion of our our comm you know comm international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . "
D,Task,"Um comm current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . "
D,Task,"For example comm you can see below there comm seventy five percent of users zap a lot comm "
D,Task,"so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So again there's power implications there . "
D,Task,"Um comm fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons comm "
D,Task,"so again a big design issue there . "
D,Task,"Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um "
D,Task,"the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier comm uh remote controls are often lost in the room comm "
D,Task,"it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing comm uh "
D,Task,"fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . "
D,Task,"Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use "
D,Task,"and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons comm "
D,Task,"they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . "
D,Task,"Um comm um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . "
D,Task,"You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . "
D,Task,"Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition comm "
D,Task,"again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control comm some kind of speech recognition . "
D,Task,"Something we didn't put to them comm but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light comm possibly . "
D,Task,"Um comm that trend reverses in the older age groups . "
D,Task,"So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features comm that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five "
D,Task,"and in the older age group it kind of reverses comm "
D,Task,"they're not so bothered with this . "
D,Task,"I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you comm "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"but I think I'll just keep it simple comm "
D,Other,"if there's any more information I can email you extra details comm "
B,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"is that okay ? "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"That's fine . "
B,Minor,"Right comm um "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Task,"we have new project requirements comm um "
B,Task,"we're not going to be using teletext comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um "
B,Task,"our control is only going to be for T_V_ comm "
B,Task,"it's not going to be a combined control comm "
B,Task,"which limits you know all of the different things that "
B,Task,"it limits the cost for us comm "
B,Task,"but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
D,Elicit,"so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? "
B,Task,"It says for T_V_ only comm "
B,Task,"so looks like it's just "
D,Task,"Just channel-hopping . "
B,Task,"yeah comm "
B,Task,"I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it comm but "
B,Elicit,"I don't know comm what do you think ? "
B,Task,"It just said comm for T_V_ only . "
D,Elicit,"Would that imply video use ? "
B,Task,"But I mean comm general T_V_ controls do do video as well . "
C,Task,"T yeah yeah . "
C,Minor,"I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g "
B,Task,"I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . If yeah "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm yes . "
C,Task,"and if you got if you got a Sky box comm they have one of those plus boxes comm you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ? "
D,Task,"Um we didn't really look into that "
D,Task,"but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Ten perc "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video comm fast-forwarding comm so on "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Pens "
C,Task,"and they're not that great anyway . "
D,Task,"In fact I've just called up that table there comm "
C,Task,"Alright comm okay . "
D,Task,"we asked those two questions comm "
D,Task,"the table relates to both questions comm so we didn't differentiate . "
D,Task,"Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen comm that's multi-function remote "
D,Task,"and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? "
C,Other,"Alright comm okay . "
D,Task,"So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group comm "
D,Task,"I think that's just general fear of new technology . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"bu "
D,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"so I thought that could be quite a "
B,Task,"We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves comm "
B,Task,"so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"um because it is something I "
B,Task,"it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose comm "
B,Task,"you were saying whistling comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something "
B,Task,"so you can't see the remote comm you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps "
B,Task,"and you're like oh okay it's over there comm something like that comm "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"That's a super idea . "
B,Task,"but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . "
B,Task,"Um so we want logo comm "
B,Task,"we want um fashionable comm trendy comm "
B,Task,"I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um comm people paying more for it to look good . "
B,Task,"Um comm we need to focus on that as well . "
D,Task,"Yes comm "
D,Task,"further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is comm "
D,Task,"it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . "
D,Task,"What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African comm I dunno comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"you get the idea . "
D,Task,"It's it's gonna vary around the world . "
D,Task,"At the end of the day comm th the engineering design is one thing comm "
D,Task,"it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So are we talking of a single model or maybe five comm six designs ? "
A,Minor,"Sure . "
C,Task,"Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Just "
A,Task,"The features could be same and the body could look slightly different . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"What about "
B,Task,"you were talking about the buttons comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big comm rubber buttons comm "
B,Task,"not tiny little one comm big comm rubber buttons comm "
B,Task,"but what about comm I mean comm 'cause we got to make it original comm what about um you know with the touch screen computers "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah that's what I was just yeah . "
B,Task,"yeah ? "
B,Task,"Um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button "
B,Task,"which shouldn't wear out as much either comm "
B,Task,"not sure about the "
C,Task,"No comm well no "
C,Task,"'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just "
B,Task,"You don't have to press it comm "
B,Task,"you just have to put your thumb onto it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm think that might appeal "
B,Task,"I'm thinking kind of Japan comm "
B,Task,"I'm thinking uh young comm um office people comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"trendy kind of a thing . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def "
B,Task,"Um comm but quite comm um comm easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations comm um "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs comm ergonomics "
C,Task,"uh there's sort of physically different things "
C,Task,"'cause um if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers "
C,Task,"because people in Japan wouldn't buy it "
C,Task,"because the controller was physically to big "
B,Task,"Were too big . "
C,Task,"because um they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"so they couldn't get round the controller "
C,Minor,"which is uh so if you I don't know what 'cause you "
C,Task,"obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use comm the injuries comm maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So comm a bigger b "
A,Task,"okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups comm "
A,Task,"you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also comm the market . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"I think we have to design one product "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh "
B,Task,"in the sense that they can make it smaller comm or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly comm um . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same comm yes comm absolutely . "
B,Task,"It's gonna be the same comm "
B,Task,"so we need to focus on just one thing comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities comm um . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I'm concerned comm "
D,Task,"when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again comm repetitive strain injury comm I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough comm "
D,Task,"I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . "
D,Task,"Um comm R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I'm j I really can't get my head round this one comm "
D,Task,"this may have to be postponed to a future meeting "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"but it's something we should think about . "
C,Task,"I yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that "
C,Task,"'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I know comm and it becomes ridiculous comm yes I know . "
C,Minor,"and it becomes "
C,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Or a speech recognition comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm speech recognition comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"which is extremely expensive comm "
C,Minor,"but "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Do we have to initially um comm you know looking at the findings here comm focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . "
D,Elicit,"Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"We could focus on the biggest market . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Ge uh "
A,Task,"If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? "
D,Task,"And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people comm young people comm trendy people . "
B,Task,"We are "
B,Task,"we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . "
B,Task,"That they want um it to be fashionable comm "
B,Task,"they want it to be trendy "
B,Task,"and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Now with the baby boomers comm the older generations are actually larger comm "
B,Task,"they have a greater population than us young people comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but I don't think we're focusing on that comm "
B,Task,"I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um comm business kind of class type people . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too comm "
D,Task,"for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage comm we want to comm you know comm not waste money comm not be profligate "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up comm first "
D,Task,"it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so the remote control functions . "
B,Task,"Um we've got the T_V_ comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"we've got the video comm "
B,Elicit,"now there's um I can't remember what it's called comm the little code at the end of programme details comm "
C,Task,"Video plus . "
B,Task,"yes . "
B,Task,"We could use that as an alternative to programming in times comm things like that comm "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
B,Minor,"is that "
B,Task,"I always found that really easy when I discovered it comm um "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"because you've got your general record anyway "
B,Task,"so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on comm that's fine comm "
B,Task,"but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to comm you put the number in "
C,Task,"Just whack in the number . "
B,Task,"and it's just a number comm "
B,Task,"it's not a date comm "
B,Task,"it's not a time comm "
B,Task,"it's not a channel comm "
B,Task,"it's not when it finishes comm "
B,Task,"it's not anything like that comm "
C,Minor,"And you w "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"it's just a number . "
C,Task,"And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that comm "
C,Task,"you just need one "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway comm "
B,Task,"You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Right comm "
D,Task,"I've not come across that function "
D,Task,"but it sounds wonderful . "
B,Task,"It is "
B,Minor,"after um "
B,Task,"if you look in the newspaper comm T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five comm six digit number afterwards "
C,Minor,"It's not "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and that's the number you put in "
D,Minor,"Ah comm hmm . "
B,Task,"and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth "
B,Task,"so you don't have to worry about dates "
B,Task,"and you don't have to worry about times comm "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"um and it has been around for quite a long time . "
C,Task,"It's been been around for a long time "
C,Task,"it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . "
B,Task,"No it's not "
D,Task,"Superb . "
B,Task,"um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it "
C,Task,"you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series . "
D,Task,"Excellent comm mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"So that yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"But just to have that function would be would be really good . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Okay so "
D,Other,"Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me comm "
D,Task,"I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another comm "
D,Task,"but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me comm to produce our own mobile phones comm that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features comm "
D,Task,"um comm chain companies like Carphone Warehouse comm you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it comm "
D,Task,"they'll phone the company comm you can use their telephones . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service "
D,Task,"so that if older users were deterred from buying this comm if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets comm th you know comm which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service comm would that not make it more attractive to them ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract "
C,Task,"so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out "
D,Minor,"Mm . Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and also I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service "
C,Task,"but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having "
D,Other,"Right . "
B,Task,"The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there comm you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing comm it's not working comm what should I do ? "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Minor,"Yes "
D,Task,"If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel comm "
D,Minor,"but I mean for if there were any more "
D,Elicit,"or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video comm "
D,Elicit,"we're not gonna put any "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I think so . "
C,Minor,"I mean "
D,Task,"okay comm just a thought . "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that . "
B,Task,"Instruction manuals . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But I mean they're there's customer service comm "
B,Task,"there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Department comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Sure . "
B,Task,"and that way there's no call out charge comm "
B,Task,"there's no extra comm "
B,Task,"t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street comm um . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to "
A,Task,"for a phone maybe he might walk down the street comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . "
D,Task,"Not for such simple functions "
C,Minor,"And they're "
C,Minor,"yeah comm they should be f yeah . "
D,Task,"because we're focusing on that comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"yes okay . "
B,Task,"But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible "
A,Minor,"Simple . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious comm yes . "
C,Minor,"It's the uh "
B,Task,"It does comm "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong "
B,Task,"and then you try and search through it comm "
B,Task,"so that should be something we think about . "
D,Task,"Sure comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Um comm what other functions ? "
B,Minor,"We need "
B,Task,"I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now comm "
B,Minor,"but we should think about c "
B,Minor,"'cause you've got the dilemma between "
B,Task,"oh batteries comm that's what I was thinking about . "
B,Elicit,"Mobile phone batteries comm what kinda battery is that ? "
C,Task,"Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones comm "
C,Task,"but they come with a charger comm "
C,Task,"I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but "
B,Task,"Well they la they they last quite a long time comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"and if you had uh when you "
B,Task,"th the thing that you get with mobile house phones comm you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out "
B,Task,"'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm something like that should reduce the size of it . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"and if "
C,Task,"yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"it could be on that "
C,Task,"Yeah on that as well so . "
B,Task,"yeah comm okay . "
B,Minor,"S "
A,Elicit,"So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"some sort of docking station or "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Rechargeable with a docking station . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"So the rechargeable which would be your field . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time . "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"which it is cheaper in the long run as well . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm th the shape you got trendy . "
B,Task,"I don't wanna big box with lots of things comm "
B,Task,"you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"um "
D,Minor,"And we don't w "
D,Task,"I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical comm "
D,Task,"these long comm brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . "
B,Task,"They do . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"We definitely "
D,Task,"an ob an obvious thing comm a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles comm "
D,Task,"we don't want that . "
B,Task,"Okay so we've got a flip-screen . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . "
A,Task,"Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box comm like a chocolate . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That's very strenuous "
A,Task,"because your thumb is slightly up comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"so they came up with something like this comm curled up comm so here comm "
A,Task,"and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much comm "
A,Task,"so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing comm curled up like a boat . "
D,Task,"Slightly curved comm curved . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . "
A,Task,"So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway . "
A,Task,"y yeah "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom comm something like that . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth . "
B,Task,"Can you look into the company logo ? "
B,Task,"Um comm things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . "
A,Minor,"Current . "
B,Task,"I mean for example comm if it was a C_ or something like that comm you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell comm or something comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design comm "
B,Task,"while also making it quite different from anything else that's there . "
A,Task,"We could look in at that "
D,Other,"I mean look at the mobile . "
A,Task,"but Mm . What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells comm "
A,Minor,"logo could become as "
A,Task,"you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model comm "
A,Task,"rather than you know comm trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . "
B,Task,"Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different . "
D,Task,"I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea comm "
D,Task,"I've not come across anything like that before comm "
A,Other,"A sea shell ? "
D,Minor,"if it kind of "
D,Task,"yeah "
D,Task,"and that opens out into your flip-top . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Then it's nice t to h "
D,Task,"you can make it lightweight plastic comm "
D,Minor,"nice to hold in the palm of the hand "
D,Task,"and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers comm that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . "
D,Task,"I think it's a really nice idea "
A,Other,"Yeah we could look in at that . "
D,Minor,"and plus you can get "
D,Task,"you know even though we're using plastic comm you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic comm "
D,Task,"we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . "
B,Task,"Or you could do um different comm like you get with mobile phones comm different fascias . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"You could have different kind of casings . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Less chance of it being lost too comm "
D,Task,"it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament "
D,Task,"they don't not gonna lose it so much either . "
D,Task,"It's easier to bit nice to handle . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah maybe we could come at some say five comm six des designs "
A,Task,"and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"that could be the most common design . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"But we can like think of five comm six designs . "
B,Task,"Right comm I think we have to round it up comm um "
D,Other,"Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything . "
B,Task,"Sure . "
D,Task,"So it's no teletext comm "
D,Task,"it's only for T_V_ and by implication video comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control comm "
D,Elicit,"um something about Videoplus . "
B,Task,"That was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions comm making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Right comm so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_ comm a reminder about using Videoplus ? "
D,Task,"So that they have a look at the guide and "
D,Elicit,"Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements comm "
D,Elicit,"is this just that was an add-on feature ? "
B,Task,"It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel comm things like that . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Right comm so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? "
B,Minor,"Um it could be it c "
B,Minor,"It "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"yes comm "
D,Other,"Right . "
B,Task,"it could be uh adv advertisement feature comm um rather than design feature comm "
B,Task,"you know comm drawing attention to that . "
B,Task,"And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual comm "
B,Task,"'cause it's very simple "
B,Task,"so putting it down in words should be helpful . "
D,Task,"Mm comm and the rechargeable batteries . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements ? "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"We've got the buttons "
B,Task,"but I think we'll work through that with the design of it comm um . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"That's not at the moment a requirement comm "
D,Task,"it's something we're looking at comm "
B,Task,"Yes . Yes . "
D,Task,"what preference "
D,Task,"so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . "
B,Task,"And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something comm a beeping for being lost comm um . "
A,Task,"For detection comm right . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . "
B,Task,"But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it "
B,Task,"so it should be fine "
B,Task,"and the I the instruction manual comm I don't know if we deal with that comm um . "
B,Minor,"I think "
B,Minor,"Yep comm "
A,Minor,"Yep comm "
B,Task,"and different from what's out there . "
A,Minor,"I think "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yep comm I think that's us . "
D,Elicit,"What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? "
A,Minor,"True . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ? "
B,Task,"I think you might get guidance comm "
B,Minor,"but um "
B,Minor,"I th "
B,Task,"Instruction manuals comm "
B,Task,"'cause there tends to be a demonised thing comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"u um comm they're everyone's got like a big pile of them comm "
B,Task,"but no one really uses them . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
D,Other,"Whoops comm questionnaire four . "
A,Other,"Oops . "
A,Minor,"We should f "
B,Minor,"Yes comm right . Okay . "
D,Task,"'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think . "
A,Task,"I think it's time for us to get back to "
B,Minor,"Right comm okay . "
B,Other,"I think you can email me comm if there's any more questions . "
B,Other,"Um and I'll be able to not answer them . "
