A,Task,"So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design "
A,Task,"and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . "
A,Minor,"So . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So let's see the what did you prepare . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"so can you go out to the shared folder ? "
B,Task,"Mm the shared folder . "
A,Elicit,"Sh share folder for th your presentation ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"We have a presentation . "
A,Minor,"Because I have here "
B,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"So I got the participant uh three . "
B,Minor,"W uh . "
B,Task,"Three . "
B,Task,"It's the final design comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay just one . "
B,Task,"S so so I discussed with Guillaume . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"And uh so we have "
B,Task,"and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes comm "
B,Task,"because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . "
B,Task,"So we come up with two versions . "
B,Task,"One with and one without L_C_D_s . "
B,Task,"Um but both comes with a charger "
B,Task,"and then detachable and uh or control module . "
B,Task,"And detachable big buttons for all people um . "
B,Minor,"So . "
C,Other,"S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes . "
C,Task,"Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . "
C,Minor,"You you can s here . "
C,Task,"And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"You can uh choose the direction "
C,Task,"and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . "
C,Task,"And here the the switch that control if you want "
A,Elicit,"Why you why you you put it in the the side ? "
C,Minor,"Well I I I think uh it's the "
A,Task,"It's not a good place maybe . "
C,Minor,"Yeah but "
B,Task,"No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . "
B,Task,"The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? "
C,Task,"Well so it's a microphone array . "
A,Task,"Oh it's very costly comm microphone array . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"No "
C,Task,"it's just a single microphone comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"and you "
C,Task,"I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"well it's better to to to place it here th than here comm for instance . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . "
C,Task,"And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . "
A,Elicit,"How much does it cost this one ? "
C,Task,"Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars "
B,Minor,"For the "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Fifteen dollars ? "
C,Task,"fifteen dollars comm "
C,Minor,"but uh well it's not it's not uh "
A,Task,"Ah it's above it's above the budget . "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"but uh it's just a prototype "
C,Task,"and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila . "
D,Task,"The cost would be le reduced . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Elicit,"How many b battery is there ? "
C,Other,"How many comm excuse me ? "
A,Task,"Battery . "
C,Task,"Well uh f battery comm we use uh about uh "
B,Task,"Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"A_A_ rechargeable batteries . "
C,Task,"Rechargeable of course comm "
B,Task,"Yeah rechargeable batteries . "
C,Task,"because we have the charger . "
B,Task,"We have the charger so it's no problem . "
C,Minor,"Yeah and you just "
A,Elicit,"So one one battery ? "
C,Task,"On uh yeah one battery . "
D,Elicit,"Is that two or one ? "
A,Task,"It's kinetic reserve . "
B,Task,"Actually uh it's a flexible thing . "
B,Minor,"You just n uh "
D,Elicit,"Now what is the whole day rating for that ? "
C,Minor,"The "
D,Task,"Whole day's rating . "
C,Other,"excuse me ? "
D,Elicit,"What type of battery ? "
C,Other,"Oh yeah "
C,Task,"it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Minor,"if you uh like it's exist . "
D,Elicit,"Something like a two A_ comm A_ three size batteries ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and uh leave it uh alone comm it's alright . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Then the next time you pick it comm oh "
B,Minor,"At uh yeah . "
C,Task,"it works . "
B,Task,"I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there comm "
C,Task,"Yeah just explain the button uh Norman . "
B,Minor,"b this button "
B,Task,"yeah alright . "
B,Task,"This button is like the mouse is like a joystick comm "
B,Task,"you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction "
B,Task,"so you can make a turn "
B,Task,"and it the additi functions associated to all the actions "
B,Task,"you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"You can move up comm down comm left comm right comm "
B,Task,"or you can do a swing . "
B,Task,"So a swing to the left comm a swing to the right defines other functions . "
B,Task,"So even though it's a single button comm but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . "
D,Elicit,"And the L_C_D_ is this one comm on the remote ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ . "
A,Task,"I think it's not a good idea "
A,Task,"because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"If you "
B,Task,"Uh okay this is new prototype uh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah it's "
C,Task,"So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . "
C,Task,"The second version is also simpler comm "
C,Task,"we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also . "
C,Minor,"So basically th it's the same uh "
D,Task,"Uh-huh and also the switch . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . "
C,Task,"But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . "
C,Task,"Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And uh it's also cheaper to produce . "
C,Task,"We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . "
A,Task,"No four dollars comm it's good . "
D,Task,"And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger comm "
B,Task,"Oh no "
B,Task,"th actually th we'll come to that point in our "
D,Task,"because that's a major that's a "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay "
D,Elicit,"and if you disable speech recognition system then ? "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . "
D,Minor,"Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm . "
C,Task,"so Norman will explain to you . "
A,Elicit,"And we will we will serve the charger with this ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah of course mm . "
B,Minor,"Th they either these with the uh the the charger any "
A,Task,"With the remote control . "
B,Task,"in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Elicit,"so the price of the charger included in the "
B,Task,"Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh . "
C,Task,"Thank thank you . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"And so mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone "
B,Task,"but uh again depends on the types . "
B,Task,"I think we have to investigate more on that comm but "
A,Task,"The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"Well that's so "
B,Task,"but as the Marketing Manager says comm people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . "
D,Task,"Yeah people are willing to pay more comm "
A,Minor,"We have we have just "
D,Task,"but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"The price of selling is twenty five Euros . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"And the price of production "
C,Minor,"Alright "
C,Task,"please uh go on Norman with the special features . "
D,Minor,"Or uh "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Other,"we'll we'll come up to that comm "
B,Task,"the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular "
B,Task,"so you want more function you pay more . "
B,Task,"If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system comm "
B,Task,"so is uh modular . "
A,Task,"That's for this basis function "
A,Task,"and if you want more you pay more . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah comm "
D,Task,"Something like customised . Yeah "
B,Task,"for example the L_C_D_ comm you can take it you can put it put it back in comm or you can use the other one comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm hmm hmm hmm . "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"Hmm okay . "
B,Task,"It's pretty flexible in the yeah price . "
C,Task,"You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control "
A,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"Uh yeah yeah "
B,Task,"you should present that . "
D,Elicit,"And this is other one ? "
C,Task,"that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control "
C,Task,"i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do comm and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"H here is just the the the module for the kids "
C,Task,"and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ comm up they come up with their modules comm "
D,Minor,"Mm hmm hmm hmm . "
C,Task,"they just plug in it "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"and they can have all the control they want here . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons comm clearly labelled comm "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"and it acts like the previous one comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"you just plug in and it works . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . "
B,Task,"Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons comm "
B,Task,"powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n "
B,Task,"but here you only have few buttons "
B,Task,"but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . "
B,Task,"But in addition with simplicity . "
B,Task,"So that's the best idea comm "
B,Minor,"the cond that "
B,Task,"that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . "
B,Task,"The first one is the speech recogniser comm "
B,Task,"again it's detachable or add-on . "
B,Task,"And then we also have security feature "
B,Task,"for example this here oop "
B,Task,"it's very robust comm "
B,Task,"it doesn't break "
B,Elicit,"and the material comm what's the material again ? "
C,Task,"The titanium "
C,Minor,"and so it's very uh "
A,Minor,"Titanium . "
B,Task,"Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one comm "
B,Task,"again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's fine . "
B,Task,"Lithium-ion may be a good one comm "
B,Task,"but you can replace it with cheaper one comm "
B,Task,"again you pay for what you get comm "
B,Task,"and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . "
B,Task,"So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ comm uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger comm "
B,Other,"so so that's the or is it "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"that's the reminder part . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"and um "
B,Task,"And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary comm "
B,Task,"so we didn't define the vocabulary "
B,Task,"so it's up to the user to define "
D,Minor,"Mm hmm hmm hmm . "
B,Task,"so "
B,Task,"sorry ? "
B,Task,"And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre comm "
B,Task,"and this can be used by the adult or by the children . "
B,Task,"So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . "
B,Task,"So it's pretty powerful comm "
B,Task,"and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced comm because of this feature . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And and for the materials that is cheap to produce "
B,Minor,"I think uh it's quite clear from yeah . "
B,Task,"And also like the and the fancy designs yeah . "
B,Task,"Maybe we can improve more on the design but "
A,Minor,"What what's "
A,Task,"Maybe yeah . "
A,Elicit,"What's the price to p to produce ? "
B,Task,"uh this is the "
C,Task,"Well so the price to produce For uh the simplest one comm say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . "
C,Minor,"Uh it's about it "
A,Elicit,"With with with the charge ? "
C,Task,"The without without the charger "
D,Elicit,"With the charger ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . "
C,Task,"Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules comm "
C,Elicit,"and finally three dollars for the charger . "
C,Task,"So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_ comm which costs two dollar comm you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . "
A,Task,"We don't have charger . "
C,Minor,"It's about "
D,Task,"I think we can use Excel . "
A,Task,"We don't have all the options . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . "
A,Task,"Charger we don't have charger here either . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"No it's "
C,Task,"But it's just if you want all functionalities . "
A,Task,"it's below the the the budget . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Excuse me ? "
A,Task,"It's below the bu the budget . "
D,Task,"Yeah it's a nice input "
A,Minor,"We "
D,Task,"but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . "
D,Task,"I think we will just have a rough look "
D,Task,"and then we can make our statements comm "
D,Task,"and we can finalise the product based on this discu "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think we can just go to my presentation then . "
D,Task,"We can wind up . "
D,Task,"Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions . "
D,Task,"So the marketing made an evaluation criteria "
D,Task,"and these were some of the findings comm "
D,Task,"and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ comm without L_C_D_ comm with speech recognition interface comm or without speech recognition interface comm "
D,Task,"but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is comm they want to have an fancy look and feel comm "
D,Task,"it should be very fancy with colourful "
D,Task,"and uh very handy to hold . "
D,Task,"And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . "
D,Task,"And the third one is easy to use . "
C,Task,"Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons . "
D,Task,"Okay and if we go to the next slide comm "
D,Task,"here you can find these are the latest fashion updates comm "
D,Task,"and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable comm "
D,Task,"so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable comm or whatever they like . "
B,Other,"Spongy spongy . "
B,Minor,"Mm mm . "
D,Task,"So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . "
B,Minor,"Mm mm . "
D,Task,"And the second thing is comm and if the material comm they really do not want it to be very hard comm as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium comm "
D,Task,"it should be somewhat spongy . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"But the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling ? "
B,Minor,"We have "
B,Task,"you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . "
C,Task,"A sponge . "
D,Task,"Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias . "
B,Task,"Spongy . "
D,Task,"One is fancy look comm "
D,Task,"second is innovative comm "
D,Task,"and third is easy to use . "
D,Task,"So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"say that we have a seven point scale comm from one to seven comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ comm "
D,Task,"so on this scale comm if it is true comm if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"or if it is false comm it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy comm then you could just tell me seven . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"We can make our study on this and "
B,Elicit,"so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? "
D,Task,"No no "
D,Task,"we have you have designed two products now comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? "
A,Task,"You . "
D,Task,"According to you comm "
D,Task,"no "
D,Task,"according to you designers comm "
D,Elicit,"how will feel does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ . "
D,Elicit,"On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look how does it look ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Unlab,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? "
C,Task,"Well it doesn't look much fancy "
C,Task,"I'll I'll say three or four . "
D,Elicit,"And you both agree for that ? "
A,Elicit,"And you ? "
B,Task,"I think we can improve on the design . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design . "
C,Minor,"It's it it "
B,Task,"Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect comm functional aspect comm but also the simplicity . "
C,Task,"Technical aspects . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help . "
D,Elicit,"So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? "
C,Task,"Yeah a three . "
D,Elicit,"So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh four . "
D,Minor,"Four . "
C,Task,"I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated "
C,Task,"so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"And in the sense of innovativeness comm with L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"Well it's it's the same for both "
C,Task,"so I will give a five comm six . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Elicit,"Five with L_C_D_ and "
C,Task,"Well five also uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Elicit,"Norman please . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content comm "
B,Task,"because uh that is really innovative comm "
B,Task,"and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity "
B,Task,"and simplicity comm few buttons comm we've uh A lot of functionalities . "
C,Task,"With lot of functionalities . "
D,Elicit,"So without L_C_D_ ? "
B,Task,"So that is uh that is uh for both th "
B,Minor,"Our gi "
B,Task,"I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all "
B,Task,"well this is a biased judgement "
D,Task,"No no "
B,Task,"because we designed them . "
D,Elicit,"according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh the innovation is v is very high I think . "
D,Task,"With L_C_D_ . "
A,Elicit,"For L_C_D_ . "
D,Elicit,"And without L_C_D_ ? "
B,Task,"Both . "
C,Task,"Mm for both it's the the same innovations . "
B,Task,"For both . "
B,Task,"It's the same innovation . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So maybe I can put six to seven . "
C,Task,"six comm let's go for six . "
A,Task,"Without L_C_D_ . "
B,Task,"Both . "
D,Task,"No "
D,Task,"actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . "
D,Task,"So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Uh no innovative yeah . "
D,Minor,"So we can't go "
B,Elicit,"Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? "
B,Task,"We haven't really uh determined what are actually actually "
C,Task,"Talk about "
D,Task,"I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design "
B,Task,"it's good to have a L_C_D_ "
B,Elicit,"but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? "
D,Task,"No it's like this comm "
D,Task,"I mean on the L_C_D_ comm according to what I understand from your model is comm you have a joystick here comm and you have L_C_D_ comm you just press your joystick comm you get here a programme . "
A,Task,"So let's remove it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah but "
C,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"Uh then "
C,Task,"but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . "
A,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"Yes exactly . "
A,Task,"This is the problem . "
D,Task,"No "
D,Task,"on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . "
C,Task,"If you have the L_C_D_ comm "
D,Other,"L_C_D_ ? "
C,Minor,"but if n "
D,Task,"Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Or then again you have a channels comm volume and all the stuff and what a "
B,Task,"But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . "
D,Task,"I mean that depends upon your design comm so "
B,Task,"Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ comm "
D,Minor,"I mean "
B,Task,"we give what the customer uh wants comm right . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? "
D,Elicit,"And which do you recommend e easy to use comm with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? "
C,Task,"Well I think both are really easy to use "
C,Task,"because there are few button buttons comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"and uh well t p the menu are clear comm well-organised comm so "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product "
C,Task,"so I will give a six for the easy to use . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"I think "
B,Other,"sorry . "
A,Task,"No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . "
A,Task,"Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates . "
D,Task,"So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"according to fruit and vegetable "
D,Task,"or a spongy touch "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . "
D,Task,"Even then our product is going to be very good . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's cheaper to produce . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . S "
C,Minor,"And uh if the the "
C,Task,"well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so "
D,Task,"Yeah that's right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . "
B,Task,"I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . "
B,Task,"For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity comm "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah that's right . "
B,Task,"so that's why we have the parental module . "
B,Task,"Uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it comm "
B,Task,"but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . "
B,Task,"So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . "
B,Task,"User customisation is very important "
B,Minor,"yeah . Yeah "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? "
C,Task,"Six . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"W uh "
D,Elicit,"Or you want it to be six ? "
C,Task,"Um six . "
B,Task,"I think it's the same . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yes as you say comm with better uh "
A,Task,"Without L_C_D_ . "
D,Task,"S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"And to improve the the look . "
D,Task,"As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and it's going to be much simpler to use . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so let's go back to our laboratory and "
D,Minor,"So . "
A,Elicit,"What a what what about the sys speech recognition ? "
B,Task,"To improve on the design . "
B,Other,"Huh ? "
A,Elicit,"what about the integration of speech recognition ? "
B,Task,"The speech recogniser is a add-on module . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Right ? "
D,Task,"That's going to be an optional . "
D,Task,"If somebody wants to buy it they can have it comm otherwise no . "
A,Other,"Ah so it's optional with the okay . "
D,Task,"It's an optional . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's optional yeah comm "
C,Task,"since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than "
A,Minor,"I think it will be I think i "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control comm "
A,Task,"because maybe parents will lose these uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but I mean if you have an add-ons comm the kids may just uh hide the parental module "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Or ma yeah . "
D,Task,"and so that their parents can't use it . "
A,Task,"Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or comm "
A,Task,"so mayb better if you have all this in the same "
D,Task,"In the same set comm yeah comm "
D,Task,"and and individual buttons to make them work . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component comm and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children "
B,Task,"when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people comm "
B,Task,"and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . "
B,Task,"So we might lose the customer because of this . "
B,Task,"I don't know comm "
B,Elicit,"what do you think uh ? "
A,Task,"So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional . "
B,Task,"Yes exa "
B,Elicit,"what do you think comm "
B,Task,"I don't know . You are Marketing Manag . "
D,Task,"I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"or to the number or singles who have a television . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So based on that I think "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? "
A,Task,"I think it inc increase . "
C,Minor,"Well you can if you had uh something li "
A,Task,"I think it i increases . "
C,Task,"Oh no comm "
C,Minor,"because if you if you add uh something "
C,Task,"well yeah maybe "
C,Task,"because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah "
C,Task,"it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module comm but uh "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"On the same P_C_B_ "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer comm "
B,Task,"because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's right . "
B,Minor,"So so "
D,Task,"I mean you could just provide with an optional . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . "
B,Task,"So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer comm "
B,Task,"attracting them to come back in again and again . "
D,Task,"So it's something like a Microsoft product update . "
B,Task,"We're not trying to follow the Microsoft "
A,Task,"And and we we we we we we don't want that . "
B,Minor,"and we don't want to the m "
D,Other,"Updates and we sell it . "
D,Other,"We make updates and sell it . "
B,Task,"Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded comm it would be a good thing right ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it depends on the v production . "
D,Elicit,"And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? "
D,Elicit,"Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? "
C,Minor,"Well so "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah "
D,Elicit,"Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and "
C,Minor,"I think we are "
C,Task,"yeah "
C,Task,"but we are also the um well the components will have to change "
C,Task,"because uh we have to deal with the shape "
C,Task,"and um but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Or uh it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all comm but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Uh well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"What we can change is to propose the customers with skins . "
B,Task,"For example the i the mobile phones nowaday comm they sell different kinds of skin "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah that's right . "
B,Task,"and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah "
C,Task,"we can have the same global shape "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah you can pl "
B,Elicit,"in what material would that be in uh ? "
C,Task,"Sponge . "
D,Task,"I think you need to look into the material . "
B,Task,"Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing . "
D,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"So we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say . "
D,Task,"I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . "
A,Other,"Project evaluation project satisfaction comm for example . "
A,Task,"I don't know comm we have to ask these question . "
A,Task,"We have to give answers so "
B,Minor,"I suppose that you this criteria comm is it ? "
A,Task,"Project evaluation . "
B,Task,"Room for creativity . "
B,Task,"This room is a bit small comm but "
B,Task,"but I think it's okay for us to work with . "
D,Task,"I feel it's fine comm "
D,Task,"we know we don't need uh I think it's okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah mm . "
C,Task,"That was good . "
D,Task,"This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"And the leadership was excellent . "
A,Task,"Yeah I think so . "
B,Other,"Good job good job . "
C,Task,"Fine yes uh "
A,Task,"He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's right . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's right . "
A,Task,"Uh the teamwork was very very good . "
C,Task,"Very democratic . "
A,Task,"I was really I am very satisfying to work with with you . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
B,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Task,"And new ideas found . "
D,Elicit,"Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Come up with new product . "
D,Elicit,"I mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ? "
A,Task,"Less fancy . "
B,Task,"Mm we I I know something comm we need more cakes comm more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . "
C,Task,"Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that comm "
C,Task,"but I think it's alright . "
C,Task,"We achieved uh project goal I think . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"that is within the budget . "
A,Minor,"De "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"It's w "
C,Task,"yes comm more or less . "
D,Task,"And the evaluation was "
A,Task,"Without without L_C_D_ comm without speech recognition comm it will be simple . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's right . "
C,Task,"Yeah but "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Task,"And the next is celebration . "
C,Minor,"So . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Other,"So uh coffee machine . "
A,Other,"Yeah free free coffee "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Alright then comm we finished ? "
A,Other,"Yeah thank you for your work and "
D,Other,"Yeah thank you comm thank you very much . "
B,Other,"Thank you very much . "
