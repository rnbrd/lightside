A,Other,"I'm proud of it . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"This is our final meeting comm the detailed design meeting . "
C,Other,"And again I'll take minutes . "
C,Minor,"The "
C,Task,"what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two comm "
C,Elicit,"so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Um then "
B,Task,"It does look very cool . "
C,Task,"then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . "
C,Task,"Then I need to say some st a few things about finance comm "
C,Task,"'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . "
C,Task,"Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . "
C,Task,"Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . "
C,Elicit,"So we've got forty minutes . S "
B,Other,"And then do we get to make a remote control ? "
C,Other,"'Cause we missed out . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"it's now "
C,Task,"I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five comm "
C,Task,"so we've got until four fifteen . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Elicit,"Is that right ? "
A,Elicit,"How how much do we have comm forty minutes ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm about four fifteen comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"until about four fifteen . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so . "
C,Task,"Go for it . "
C,Minor,"Do you want "
D,Minor,"So comm you said um "
D,Elicit,"are are we starting with the the "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Presentation . "
D,Elicit,"so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things "
D,Other,"and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things comm like the buttons and the scrolling things and "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . "
A,Minor,"Um "
B,Elicit,"You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? "
B,Task,"It's a bit um phallic . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Um "
D,Task,"Well comm but it's it's just an a approximation . "
C,Other,"Dual use comm perfect . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Dual use comm perfect . "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
B,Minor,"your remote control "
B,Other,"? Oh that's just bad . "
C,Other,"Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? "
C,Other,"Sorry comm sorry . "
A,Task,"Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So now we we have the okay comm "
A,Task,"so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . "
A,Task,"And it flips open on the side comm so it opens like that . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And we have the user interface o in here "
C,Task,"Wow . "
A,Task,"and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"well comm everything else is probably user interface comm so . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Other,"Uh yeah . "
C,Elicit,"And it's the whole thing's made of rubber comm is that "
D,Task,"Rubber . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah . Yeah comm it has comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm . "
B,Elicit,"Is it to scale comm or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? "
D,Task,"Um it could be made a bit smaller comm "
D,Task,"and and of course it would be and "
D,Task,"yeah comm but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing comm that one side was supposed to be rounder comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so we said the back side round comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"well comm but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It l does look like the curvy "
B,Task,"and then the whole shape's curvy comm "
B,Task,"so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . Hmm . "
D,Task,"And it's spongy as well . "
B,Task,"I wasn't very keen on that comm but yeah . "
D,Task,"So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three "
D,Task,"there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So it's four comm up to four comm up to seven comm up to nine and zero comm z zero here . "
C,Task,"Six seven eight nine . "
C,Task,"I like that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And then comm well this is on off button . "
D,Task,"It's it's quite standard mm place for it "
D,Task,"and and also the colour is quite often red comm "
D,Task,"so it's it's kind of user friendly . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and "
D,Task,"like the previous one and the next one . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here comm previous and ne prevon prevon next . "
B,Elicit,"So where's the volume ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The volume is is scrolling . "
D,Task,"On the side comm "
A,Task,"It's on the side . "
D,Task,"this one . "
B,Task,"Ah comm you did get that in then comm "
D,Task,"Yeah you just do it like this . "
B,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid comm because if you flip it open comm you can still do the scrolling here . "
B,Task,"Oh okay comm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"See ? "
D,Task,"So the volume is you just scroll comm "
D,Task,"but then once you flip it open comm okay comm there there you have the screen "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"You can move back and forth "
D,Task,"and then if you need to m choose something on the screen comm you just push the cen mm the middle button . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Cool . "
B,Task,"Oh comm the thing we forgot was like a mute button . "
D,Other,"A mute button . "
A,Minor,"Uh no comm we we'd not put "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Well comm we'll have this on the screen comm on the display . "
A,Task,"so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials . "
C,Task,"Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you "
B,Task,"On the wheel comm like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . "
A,Task,"Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know comm the main menu will have various options . "
D,Minor,"Well comm but the but the mute "
D,Task,"yeah comm the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute comm right ? "
C,Task,"But if you hold it in comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but it's a scroll and click comm isn't it ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? "
D,Task,"Okay comm yeah comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm cool . "
B,Task,"So that that solves the whole mute issue . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And okay comm so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . "
D,Task,"You can't really see it in the interface . "
C,Minor,"no . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's hidden in there somewhere . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And we do have the logo on it as well . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm comm very good . "
D,Minor,"So I think it "
C,Task,"And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think um we could do l the logo in grey comm as it is on the website . "
A,Minor,"Cool . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We ran out of resources here comm so . "
D,Task,"In the actual one . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So if you have questions . "
A,Other,"You can have a look . "
C,Other,"Very good comm let's have a look . "
C,Task,"Test it out . "
B,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour comm I guess . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm oh comm we hold the remote . "
B,Task,"Oh comm but it it does feel all cold and slimy . "
B,Other,"I hate Play-Do comm "
B,Other,"it's just minging . "
B,Task,"But yeah comm uh that's cool comm cool . "
C,Task,"Very good . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Okay comm so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"and then we'll there "
A,Task,"Yeah comm see the budget . "
C,Task,"I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues comm "
C,Task,"but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . "
C,Task,"We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country "
C,Task,"and cut some of the prices that way . "
B,Task,"Wales . "
C,Task,"Wales comm for example . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Cool comm okay . Right comm okay . "
B,Task,"Fabulous comm "
C,Other,"Marketing Expert . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm cool . "
B,Task,"So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale comm "
B,Task,"so one is comm you know comm yes comm it totally meets with that requirement "
B,Task,"and seven is comm no comm it really doesn't comm we need to go back and start again . "
B,Task,"Um comm you know . Basically comm what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . "
B,Task,"Um you know comm so that we can evaluate each one and like "
B,Task,"so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah comm we did manage to do that comm or oh no comm we really forgot about that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Okay ? "
B,Task,"Cool comm "
B,Task,"so these are what they are . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
C,Task,"So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . "
C,Elicit,"Is that right ? "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"I did have A_ comm B_ comm C_ comm and D_ down here comm "
B,Task,"but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . "
C,Other,"Mm dots comm never mind . "
B,Task,"Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ comm B_ comm C_ comm and D_ comm then that would be really good . "
A,Task,"I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm the yeah comm "
D,Task,"it's definitely attractive . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
D,Task,"Oh comm the locatable thing we actually forgot . "
B,Task,"Well comm I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm just prepare one now . "
D,Other,"Shall I just prepare it now ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It will be red comm too . "
B,Minor,"Cool . Okay . "
B,Task,"So comm be attractive to look at . "
B,Task,"That's this one . "
B,Elicit,"What do you all say ? "
A,Minor,"So ? "
C,Minor,"I reckon it "
D,Elicit,"S seven was th the maximum comm yeah ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I I go for seven . "
C,Task,"Seven comm yeah comm "
B,Task,"Oh we're all so proud of the . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"it's terribly sexy . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so that'll be a seven for A_ . "
B,Minor,"Could "
B,Task,"oh no comm you can't whilst that's up there . "
B,Elicit,"Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . "
C,Other,"Ah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Excellent . "
C,Minor,"Except we can't "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"uh we can if we "
B,Task,"But that's alright . "
A,Task,"But we can we can "
B,Task,"If you take a note of them comm "
A,Other,"I can I can take note uh uh "
C,Other,"then yeah comm I'll take a note comm it's fine . "
B,Other,"and then I'll put them in in a minute . "
B,Elicit,"Okay comm so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Cool comm okay . "
B,Elicit,"Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? "
D,Task,"I would think yes comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people comm "
C,Task,"I think it does . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"I mean "
A,Task,"so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version comm which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . "
C,Other,"Alright . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But that's gonna be a problem comm "
A,Minor,"But then yeah . "
C,Task,"'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So bu it's it's not a huge problem comm "
B,Task,"I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen . "
A,Task,"because i i it is operatable . "
D,Task,"But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so they just "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but I mean because it's not like it's a pen comm you know comm "
B,Task,"left-handed people can't normally write right-handed comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but they can normally do most things right-handed comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so I would say it's not such a big issue . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm because I mean anyway comm right-handed people would be able to scroll with it comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so i if the majority are right-handed comm it's uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation comm "
B,Task,"maybe give it a five comm I would say ? "
C,Minor,"Um "
B,Elicit,"What do you what do you all think ? "
C,Task,"Six . "
D,Task,"Or maybe six comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"because it's just one one i one among the issues comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I think I think for um "
D,Minor,"I mean . Yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean most people are right-handed comm "
C,Task,"so in in terms of our greatest target group comm I think it's pretty good comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but we might want to flag it for management comm they want might want to um "
A,Minor,"One more thing is that i "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up comm right comm "
C,Minor,"They "
A,Task,"so it opens on the side . So "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"No comm yeah comm but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah comm "
D,Task,"So it won't be a problem comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I mean yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So you guys can decide wh whether "
D,Minor,"it will be and it will be "
D,Task,"it won't be heavy . "
A,Minor,"Oops . "
B,Task,"I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . "
D,Task,"Yeah well yeah comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but we which makes it kind of really big comm yeah . "
D,Task,"but it's it's a bit long . "
C,Task,"The length is gonna be difficu "
D,Task,"It's a little bit long . "
B,Minor,"Yeah um "
D,Task,"Well comm I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . "
B,Elicit,"But you were thinking about making it smaller comm yeah ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Uh this this kind of uh makes it more "
B,Minor,"Because "
D,Task,"S uh slightly smaller . "
A,Task,"and two comm it might interfere with the I_R_ channel . "
B,Task,"So you have to keep that side flat . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but if we flip it open only as much as that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So it works like a mobile phone flipping comm but y you know comm as long as that side's flat comm than that will work . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Minor,"Okay . Um okay comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"so C_ . "
B,Elicit,"Are are we admitting defeat on C_ "
B,Elicit,"or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? "
C,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"we're gonna put it like we've got "
A,Task,"we have a locator . "
C,Task,"th there's the locator dot . "
B,Task,"There's a locator . "
B,Task,"Cool comm "
D,Task,"Mm that you stick on T_V_ . "
B,Task,"so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"doesn't it ? "
B,Task,"To make it beep . "
D,Task,"Yeah well w "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or a buzzer . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"but l but the speak sample speaker is included comm "
D,Task,"so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds comm so yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So that's two comm "
B,Task,"so that's seven comm yeah . "
B,Elicit,"It's locatable ? "
D,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Fabulous . "
B,Task,"D_ . "
A,Task,"Intuitive comm "
A,Task,"completely intuitive . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"If uh uh if this means intuitive comm if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things "
D,Minor,"and it's I th I think it's "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I'd say six comm "
C,Task,"'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one comm rather than the way you've got it . "
C,Task,"I really like the way you have it comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . "
A,Task,"Intuitive . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm and I mean d "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"And uh even the scroll comm it's a it's a new technology "
A,Task,"so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni "
C,Minor,"Might be "
A,Task,"so it is kind of not very intuitive "
A,Task,"but uh it's a good technology comm I mean once they get used to it . "
C,Task,"But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So comm should we maybe say f a five "
A,Minor,"So l "
C,Task,"Five ? "
B,Task,"and say it is intuitive comm "
B,Task,"but it's different comm "
B,Task,"so comm do you know comm I mean it's obvious how to use it comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"but you might have to think about it first . "
B,Elicit,"So we give that one a five comm you think ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"I'm happy with five ? "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"I'm gonna give a seven in everything comm so . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I'm glad you're accepting this . "
B,Task,"It has taken a little while comm hasn't it ? "
B,Other,"Um intuitive but "
B,Other,"Sorry comm "
B,Task,"it's really hard to write on those . "
B,Task,"I just went a bit mad comm didn't I ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Um okay comm cool comm "
B,Task,"E_ comm "
B,Minor,"okay . "
B,Task,"Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here comm "
B,Task,"so possibly for left-handed . Investigate . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
C,Task,"But otherwise it's superb . "
B,Elicit,"So comm should we give it a six ? "
C,Task,"Six . "
B,Task,"Six ? "
D,Task,"Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design "
D,Task,"well mm I mean I d uh I dunno comm I mean the the repetitive stress things comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,". "
D,Task,"but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"yeah ? See . "
A,Task,"unless you are a all the time sitting . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm so it's kinda "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well we've banned them from "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I I think it is ergonomic . "
B,Task,"I used to send fifty texts a day comm you know comm "
B,Task,"and I never got repetitive strain injury from that comm "
A,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
B,Task,"so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything comm "
A,Task,"so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's varied . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Six ? "
B,Task,"Okay comm so we give that a six comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay comm F_ . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it does have yeah . "
C,Task,"Voice control have "
C,Task,"seven . "
A,Task,"Absolutely . "
B,Minor,"Hang on comm "
B,Elicit,"how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? "
B,Minor,"That's just "
C,Task,"Ah comm that's the second one . "
C,Task,"So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score comm "
C,Task,"but not on the previous slide . "
B,Other,"Oh okay comm cool . "
B,Minor,"Um right comm so . "
A,Task,"So it has voice control . "
B,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"so that's a seven then . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Um comm cool . "
C,Task,"G_ technologically innovative . "
A,Minor,"Anyway it ha yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Technologi well "
A,Task,"it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But in terms of the actual technology comm none of it is actually new . "
D,Task,"Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well comm which is yeah comm it's kind of new . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but I mean you don't "
C,Task,"All of the components have been used in other things before . "
D,Task,"But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but they've been brought together in a remote . "
B,Task,"They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . "
C,Minor,"But do "
C,Minor,"yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"What do you reckon comm five comm six ? "
B,Minor,". "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"what do you all think ? "
D,Task,"Six . "
B,Task,"Six ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I mean how how far can you go with a remote control comm really ? "
B,Minor,"Well comm that's it comm I mean "
D,Task,"It still has to do what i what it has to do . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really comm hasn't it ? "
B,Minor,"So comm I don't think many peop "
C,Other,"Space remote . "
B,Task,"That's it comm they can take it with them . "
C,Elicit,"Put fashion in electronics . "
A,Task,"Absolutely . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm isn't it fashionable ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
A,Task,"The carrot banana remote . "
D,Task,"It's the maximum fashion . "
B,Task,"So comm we give it seven comm "
D,Task,"Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days comm so . "
B,Minor,"and we write "
B,Other,"There we go . "
D,Task,"So I think we've done very well comm "
A,Task,"I think that's a . "
D,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"Cool . "
C,Task,"Very good . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"What's the assessment ? "
B,Task,"So comm we need the average here comm "
B,Other,"so we got "
D,Task,"The average is about six and something . "
C,Other,"Yeah comm one . "
D,Task,"A little bit over six . "
B,Other,"Seven "
C,Other,"Or a seven . "
A,Elicit,"There are how many sixes ? "
D,Task,"No comm wait comm "
B,Task,"So we've got four sevens comm "
A,Other,"One comm two comm three . "
D,Task,"a little bit under six . "
B,Task,"so that's twenty eight comm "
D,Task,"No comm wait . "
A,Task,"Three . "
B,Task,"three sixes comm "
A,Task,"And one five . "
B,Task,"eighteen . "
D,Other,"Oh comm three sixes comm okay comm yeah . "
C,Other,"Fifty one comm one comm two comm three comm four comm five comm six comm seven comm eight . "
A,Other,"Okay comm twenty eight comm thirty eight comm fo forty six . Forty six and five comm fifty one . "
C,Minor,"Six point point "
A,Other,"Fifty one divided by "
D,Task,"Six point something comm yeah . "
B,Unlab,"Two three four Seven eight . "
C,Task,"about six point five . "
D,Task,"Six point five comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Close enough . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"that's pretty good comm I think . "
C,Task,"Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . "
C,Elicit,"That's all you've got at the moment comm "
C,Elicit,"or did you have anything more ? "
B,Task,"Um no comm that's it comm "
C,Elicit,"That's it ? "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
C,Task,"So comm finance . "
C,Other,"And we'll see if we can unscrew this first . "
B,Task,"Cool comm there we go . "
C,Other,"Sorry comm "
C,Minor,"this is I'm just um "
B,Minor,". "
B,Task,"There we go and there are the marks . "
C,Task,"Beautiful . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Not anymore . "
C,Other,"Computer no signal ? "
A,Task,"Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . "
C,Other,"Adjusting . "
C,Task,"There we go . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . "
C,Task,"And now we have to calculate the production costs . "
C,Task,"So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . "
C,Elicit,"Can you read that ? "
C,Task,"Almost . "
C,Task,"More or less . "
C,Task,"Um I started filling it in comm "
C,Task,"but of course these are provisional comm so we have to go down . "
C,Task,"No hand dynamo comm right ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"One simple battery . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"No kinetic energy comm "
C,Task,"no solar . "
C,Task,"The chip comm we're going for an advanced chip on print . "
A,Task,"Advanced comm yeah . "
C,Task,"We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Um single-curved surface comm so that we can fold it . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yes . "
C,Task,"Case material we said rubber . "
D,Minor,"Rubber . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"I don't know what special colour means . "
A,Task,"Mm anything uh I think which is not more . "
D,Task,"I think something coloured comm "
D,Task,"yeah comm probably . "
D,Task,"So I think this is probably special co no ? "
C,Task,"It could be "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but rubber comes coloured comm doesn't it ? You know . "
C,Task,"Rub rubber comes coloured comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"it's I would "
C,Task,"maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured comm it's different . "
D,Task,"Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"yeah yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"let's leave it as zero comm 'cause it's easy . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . "
C,Task,"We we're definitely going to have to "
D,Task,"We have pushbuttons comm "
C,Task,"so we've got pushbutton comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"and then we've "
D,Task,"scro we have scroll wheel as well . "
C,Task,"Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had comm no ? "
D,Task,"S yeah comm yeah comm "
A,Minor,"No uh we we have uh yeah . "
D,Task,"we had comm for muting comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And we have L_C_ display "
D,Minor,"and yeah . "
C,Task,"And button supplements . "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Mm no . "
B,Minor,". "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"We don't have "
C,Minor,"No . No ? "
A,Task,"we're not using any of that . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but what do we ha we have L_C_ display comm but but the wh but the s spinning wheel "
C,Task,"But the the spinning wheel's not there . "
C,Task,"I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay comm let's yeah . "
B,Task,"We've got more than one pushbutton though comm "
B,Elicit,"haven't we ? "
C,Minor,"I think the pushbutton "
C,Other,"oh . "
B,Minor,"'Cause then you have "
C,Task,"I don't know if that's one "
B,Task,"That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? "
B,Task,"Not counting anything comm we'd still be in budget . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That seems unlikely . "
C,Minor,"Push what uh "
A,Minor,"Huh ? "
A,Elicit,"Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh . "
B,Task,"Twelve point five . "
C,Task,"whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we "
D,Task,"We have to count all of them comm "
D,Minor,"or yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm I don't think so comm no . "
C,Task,"I don't think that makes sense . "
B,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"Well it doesn't comm but it uh "
A,Task,"No it says what what is the kind of interface comm "
C,Minor,"No . "
A,Task,"if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five comm "
A,Task,"it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And L_C_ display . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So comm as we can see comm that's way too expensive down here . "
A,Elicit,"Wh wh what's our criteria ? "
B,Minor,"This sample sensor . "
C,Task,"Our budget's twelve point five . "
A,Other,"Uh okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm the sample sensor will have to go comm "
B,Task,"'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"so that has implications though for the . "
A,Task,"Uh it does not have for voice recognition comm "
A,Task,"but it does have for the feedback speaker . "
A,Task,"when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"For the locator . "
B,Task,"But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really comm isn't it ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm and the locator also goes away . "
B,Task,"We can afford to get rid of it . "
D,Task,"But it was very no innovative "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"So that means no locator comm does it ? "
D,Minor,"innovativeness . Well um yeah . "
B,Minor,"I mean does "
C,Elicit,"What else does it need ? "
D,Task,"Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive comm "
D,Task,"but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"'cause the sample speaker was comm I think comm more complicated then just a beeping thing . "
D,Minor,"This would be "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah yeah "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"there you record your samples your speech samples and "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm okay comm so we "
A,Task,"A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface comm "
A,Task,"because it's just rubber comm so it's probably a flat surface rubber . "
A,Minor,"Uh I mean uh um yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Right comm so we need one fifty off . "
A,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"See comm I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing comm "
B,Minor,"'cause "
C,Task,"Take it down to just a scroll wheel . "
C,Task,"We could do "
A,Task,"So tha that mean that we cannot press "
D,Task,"Yeah comm then then we would be in the b budget . "
A,Elicit,"how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? "
A,Minor,"If "
A,Task,"in the L_C_D_ we can scroll comm right ? "
A,Elicit,"But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . "
D,Minor,"Yeah b "
D,Task,"no no comm "
D,Task,"you can push this one comm "
D,Task,"but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . "
B,Task,"But that's well you would just have to to spin it down . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"So that's point three . "
A,Minor,"No w w w but ha "
A,Task,"it's it's the scroll wheel "
A,Task,"and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . "
D,Task,"But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . "
D,Minor,"If you "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . "
B,Task,"That's the spin wheel though comm isn't it ? "
B,Elicit,"Didn't that come with the L_C_ "
C,Task,"That's with the L_C_ "
A,Elicit,"That comes with the L_C_D_ ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We decided comm "
C,Task,"'cause it's not on our list . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Oh so so the the this is "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"The scroll wheel is on the side . "
A,Minor,". So "
A,Minor,"we're adding costs for right comm okay "
A,Task,"uh I mean I think this is good . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"S so we're point three over . "
C,Task,"We're point three over at the moment . "
C,Minor,"It's nothing n "
B,Task,"Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether "
B,Task,"and just have pushbuttons for the volume . "
B,Task,"Could b still put them on the side . "
B,Minor,"But yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool comm but "
C,Minor,"I have "
A,Task,"Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here comm up for up and down . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"On the side . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm uh it sounds good actually comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Rather than having three different things that people have to do . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"There we go . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Oh look comm we're way under budget "
C,Task,"and we'll make huge profits "
C,Task,"and we'll all get bonuses . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm well we could admit to the single curve comm couldn't we ? "
C,Task,"Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but "
C,Task,"So that's alright . "
C,Task,"We we'll leave it at that "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"and then I'll take I can send it back to management "
C,Other,"and say we weren't quite sure about the colour comm "
C,Task,"if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it comm "
A,Task,"We have comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Excellent . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Elicit,"So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria comm as a result of doing that ? "
B,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No comm I don't think so . "
A,Task,"Not really comm no . "
A,Task,"Because we keep all the features comm "
A,Task,"we keep voice recognition comm "
A,Task,"we keep L_C_D_ display . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"We "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . "
B,Task,"We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um yeah . "
B,Task,"and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was "
B,Task,"it's not a great difference I don't think . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Alright then . "
A,Task,"But we lose the locator . "
B,Other,"Really ? "
C,Task,"We're gonna have a beep . "
D,Task,"Well we're going to have a beeping thing . "
A,Elicit,"So instead of speaker comm . "
D,Task,"But yeah comm it's it's not like sample speaker comm but it will just beep comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so we still have the locate . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Minor,"Cool . "
B,Task,"That's not a very exciting colour . "
B,Task,"I think you should make it more vegetable-like . "
D,Elicit,"Which colour comm "
C,Minor,"Tha "
D,Elicit,"the the colour of the phone or the colour of the "
B,Task,"Oh the the beeper thing . "
C,Minor,". "
D,Task,"But it can be yellow as well . "
B,Minor,"It "
D,Task,"It can come in the same colour as the the case . "
C,Task,"'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm I think Jen wants it to vibrate . "
B,Elicit,"You know comm your pen vibrates ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I know I know comm my pen vibrates . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But only for a very short time . "
C,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"looks like we've designed a banana . "
C,Task,"Well done comm team . "
C,Minor,"Um we need "
C,Task,"we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting comm "
C,Task,"so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went comm "
C,Task,"um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . "
B,Task,"Cool . "
C,Elicit,"Feedback ? "
A,Minor,"I think it mm "
C,Elicit,"Ideas ? "
D,Task,"Yeah mm comm "
D,Task,"as far as creativity is concerned comm yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . "
D,Task,"The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um we kap kept a adding things randomly . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So comm had we known "
B,Task,"If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like comm okay comm so we can have that lot comm let's just throw it together and do what we can . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm that or not comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting comm that that worked in terms of . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm mm . "
B,Task,"I think 'cause the meetings were so regular comm you know . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"It wasn't like we were alone for very long comm "
B,Task,"so you didn't st go off and think comm wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Banana . "
B,Task,"and then comm you know comm come back three days later and Jen's going look comm look comm it vibrates and it looks like a banana . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um yeah comm so yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm the m the means were very very good comm the means we used . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
C,Task,"the whiteboard digital pens . "
D,Task,"And the pens . "
B,Task,"Uh I like the pens . "
C,Task,"We like the pens . "
B,Task,"I want one . "
B,Task,"That would just be so cool comm to d do all your notes and s "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"you could take it to lectures "
C,Task,"and just write stuff down "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah comm "
C,Task,"and have it printed out when you got back to the office . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"that's it's it's "
C,Minor,"They great ? "
A,Elicit,"I wonder what one of these costs . "
C,Elicit,"Do you think they'd notice if one went ? "
B,Task,"I don't think you should say that was the recording . "
C,Minor,"Oh okay . "
B,Task,"Okay comm cover up the microphone . "
B,Other,"Alright comm let's take it . "
C,Minor,"Yep . Shh . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint comm "
C,Task,"'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static "
C,Task,"and you can't change it once you're in there comm "
B,Task,"It is a bit limiting comm isn't it ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"yep . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"The thing flew in comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"you didn't have the whole whooshing thing comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"'cause there wasn't time for that comm so yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's alright comm that always irritates me anyway comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Not that you can do that on the board comm either . "
B,Minor,"We could make some little "
D,Task,"But yeah comm but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm totally comm "
B,Task,"I mean that was fairly tight anyway comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm yeah . "
B,Minor,"back it comm this is just had to be changed "
B,Minor,". And yeah comm so cool . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? "
C,Minor,"And presumably you don't "
C,Task,"you can say nasty things as well . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I was I was satisfied with with the leadership comm yeah . "
C,Task,"I have no stake in it . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm definitely . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You weren't like a a dictating leader comm so that was always good . "
C,Task,"You have to say that comm "
C,Task,"'cause I'm taking the notes . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"I'll leave the room and you can have another go . "
B,Task,"I know you've got the pen comm "
B,Task,"you might attack me with it . "
C,Task,"Better than that than the banana . "
D,Task,"And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely comm yeah . "
C,Task,"I think it worked quite well . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? "
D,Minor,"To express them mm mm "
A,Task,"Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group comm "
D,Task,"no . "
A,Task,"so all of us got to express our opinions comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,". "
C,Task,"New ideas found . "
C,Other,"Not quite sure what about . "
D,Task,"Well it's it's it's pretty new comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really comm all this flipping open thing and "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I don't know comm "
B,Task,"I don't go shopping for remote controls that often comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm neither neither do I comm "
B,Task,"maybe somebody's already though of it . "
D,Task,"but I've never seen anything "
D,Task,"and and none of my examples were was was like this comm actually comm so . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
B,Other,"That looks boring comm I'll see if anyone's made a remote control . "
D,Task,"Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Patent patent patent . Mm . "
C,Other,"Banana remote . "
B,Task,"I think we'd like to think the ideas were new comm "
B,Task,"but we've got no way of finding out . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . "
B,Other,"That vibrates "
C,Other,"Flip . Vibrate "
C,Minor,". And uh yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . "
C,Task,"Nothing that you really want . "
C,Task,"True . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . So comm "
C,Task,"costs are within budget comm "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"well within budget comm "
C,Task,"including a little what have we got ? "
C,Task,"One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . "
C,Task,"Um we've evaluated the project . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"You've got the scores . "
B,Task,"And it's fabulous . "
C,Elicit,"Can you put that in the project documents file ? "
B,Task,"It's in the project documents . "
C,Task,"It's in there already . "
C,Task,"And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . "
C,Elicit,"Were there any was there anything that you found difficult comm "
C,Elicit,"or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? "
D,Task,"And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Otherwise it's it's all fine . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"sometimes it's like a little bit rushed . "
A,Task,"I thought that was good though comm "
A,Task,"because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay then . "
C,Task,"Um I think we're still well within our time . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"we've got like five minutes left . "
C,Task,"We've got about five minutes left comm "
C,Task,"but if we've finished comm then we've finished . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We're just too too efficient "
C,Task,"and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . "
A,Task,"We certainly are comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"mm . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"So I would say that's the end of that meeting . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm it was a pleasure working with you . "
C,Other,"Thank you comm team . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"It was very productive day and "
A,Other,"Yeah comm same here . "
B,Task,"We could draw animals on the board again . "
A,Task,"Mm uh no . "
C,Task,"Mm uh no . "
A,Task,"I don't think so . "
D,Task,"You can make some animals . "
B,Task,"I don't like Play-Doh comm no . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm you don't like anim "
B,Task,"It's just minging . "
B,Task,"It smells so bad . "
D,Task,"It doesn't ? "
B,Task,"It does . "
D,Task,"Smells quite nice . "
D,Task,"Smells very sweet . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Right comm so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . "
A,Elicit,"Was there a questionnaire already sent ? "
C,Task,"I don't know if it's already sent or not . "
B,Task,"No comm it hasn't been . "
C,Minor,"Um presumably I have to "
B,Elicit,"Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? "
C,Task,"I don't see why you can't stay here comm really . "
B,Other,"Okay comm so the other way . "
C,Other,"Did I save this one ? "
C,Other,"Production costs . "
D,Other,"I made your animal for you . "
C,Other,"It was supposed to be pink . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm that's the one "
C,Other,"But it was blue on the board . "
