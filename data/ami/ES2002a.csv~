B,Minor,"Okay "
B,Minor,"Right "
B,Task,"Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . "
B,Minor,"Um and um "
B,Task,"this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um so first of all comm just to kind of make sure that we all know each other comm "
B,Task,"I'm Laura and I'm the project manager . "
B,Elicit,"Do you want to introduce yourself again ? "
D,Minor,"Great . "
A,Task,"Hi comm I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And I'm Andrew and I'm uh our marketing "
C,Task,"Um I'm Craig and I'm User Interface . "
D,Task,"expert . "
B,Other,"Great . "
B,Minor,"Okay . Um "
B,Task,"so we're designing a new remote control and um "
B,Other,"Oh I have to record who's here actually . "
B,Other,"So that's David comm Andrew and Craig comm isn't it ? "
B,Other,"And you all arrived on time . "
B,Task,"Um yeah so des uh design a new remote control . "
B,Task,"Um comm as you can see it's supposed to be original comm trendy and user friendly . "
B,Task,"Um so that's kind of our our brief comm as it were . "
B,Task,"Um and so there are three different stages to the design . "
B,Task,"Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails . "
B,Elicit,"What did you get ? "
A,Task,"Um comm I just got the project announcement about what the project is . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Designing a remote control . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"That's about it comm didn't get anything else . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . Yeah comm that's that's it . "
B,Elicit,"Is that what everybody got ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Did you get the same thing ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . "
B,Task,"And repeat that process three times . "
B,Task,"Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"So uh you get to draw your favouriteÆæȢ animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . "
B,Elicit,"So who would like to go first ? "
D,Other,"I will go . That's fine . "
B,Task,"Very good . "
D,Minor,"Alright . So "
D,Elicit,"This one here comm right ? "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Okay . Very nice . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Task,"My favourite animal is like "
D,Task,"A beagle . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Elicit,"charac favourite characteristics of it ? Is that right ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh comm right comm well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . "
D,Task,"And comm yeah that they have lots of personality "
D,Task,"and uh be fit and in robust good health . "
D,Task,"So this is blue . "
D,Task,"Blue beagle . "
D,Task,"My family's beagle . "
B,Task,"Right . "
B,Other,"Lovely . "
C,Task,"Well comm my favourite animal would be a monkey . "
C,Task,"Then they're small cute and furry comm "
C,Task,"and uh when planet of the apes becomes real comm I'm gonna be up there with them . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Cool . "
A,Task,"There's too much gear . "
B,Task,"You can take as long over this as you like comm "
B,Task,"because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . "
B,Task,"Ok oh "
B,Task,"we do we do "
B,Task,"Don't feel like you're in a rush comm anyway . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . "
B,Task,"Ach why not "
D,Other,"Boy comm let me tell you . "
B,Task,"We might have to get you up again then . "
B,Task,"I don't know what mine is . "
B,Other,"I'm gonna have to think on the spot now . "
D,Task,"Impressionist . "
A,Task,"Can't draw . "
B,Elicit,"Is that a whale ? "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um comm well anyway comm "
A,Task,"I don't know comm it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . "
A,Task,"Um . Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . "
A,Task,"Allergic to animal fur comm "
B,Task,"Ah . "
A,Task,"so um fish was a natural choice . "
A,Minor,"Um comm yeah comm "
A,Task,"and I kind of like whales . "
A,Task,"They come in and go eat everything in sight . "
A,Task,"And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"God comm I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
D,Other,"Superb sketch comm by the way . "
A,Task,"Tail's a bit big comm I think . "
B,Task,"I was gonna choose a dog as well . "
B,Other,"But I'll just draw a different kind of dog . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"That doesn't really look like him comm actually . "
B,Task,"He looks more like a pig comm actually . "
B,Task,"Ah well . "
D,Task,"I see a dog in there . "
B,Elicit,"Do you ? "
D,Task,"Yep . "
B,Other,"Oh that's very good of you . "
D,Other,"Now I see a rooster . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Elicit,"What kind is it ? "
B,Task,"Um he's a mixture of uh various things . "
B,Other,"Um and what do I like about him comm um "
B,Task,"That's just to suggest that his tail wags . "
B,Task,"Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you comm "
B,Task,"and very kind of affectionate "
B,Minor,"and um "
B,Minor,"uh "
B,Task,"and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"and uh And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well comm "
B,Task,"which is quite amusing comm so "
D,Elicit,"Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ? "
B,Task,"It is . I think it is . "
B,Task,"He only does it after he's had his dinner "
B,Task,"and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"It's an after dinner dog then . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"so uh "
D,Task,"Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"maybe . "
B,Task,"Maybe . "
B,Elicit,"Right comm um where did you find this ? "
B,Elicit,"Just down here ? Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Um what are we doing next ? Uh um . "
B,Task,"Okay comm uh we now need to discuss the project finance . "
B,Task,"Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro comm "
B,Task,"um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . "
B,Task,"Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . "
B,Task,"And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros comm so fifty percent of the selling price . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"Um comm can we just go over that again ? "
B,Task,"Sure . "
D,Other,"Uh comm so bas at twel "
D,Task,"Alright comm yeah . Okay . "
D,Task,"So cost like production cost is twelve fifty comm "
B,Task,"All together . "
D,Elicit,"but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ? "
D,Elicit,"Like on the shelf . "
B,Task,"Um I dunno . "
B,Minor,"I imagine "
B,Task,"That's a good question . "
D,Task,"Our sale our sale anyway . "
B,Task,"I imagine it probably is our sale actually "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm okay okay . "
B,Task,"because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
B,Task,"But I I don't know comm "
B,Elicit,"I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Other,"Think it will ? "
D,Unlab,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh comm like with D_V_D_ players comm if there are zones . "
B,Task,"Oh yeah comm "
D,Task,"Um f frequencies or something "
B,Task,"regions and stuff comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"um as well as uh characters comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"um different uh keypad styles and s symbols . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well for a remote control comm do you think that will be "
D,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It does make sense from maybe the design point of view "
A,Task,"'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages comm then you need more buttons . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So comm possibly . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . "
D,Task,"I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region comm whereas in another it'll be different comm so "
B,Elicit,"What comm just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? "
D,Minor,"Just a chara just a characteristic of the "
B,Elicit,"Like how much money people have to spend on things like ? "
D,Minor,"Just "
D,Task,"Or just like comm basic product podi positioning comm "
D,Task,"the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London comm "
D,Task,"might not be such a big hit in Greece comm "
D,Other,"who knows comm "
B,Task,"Aye comm I see what you mean comm yeah . "
D,Other,"something like that comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Marketing . "
B,Task,"Good marketing thoughts . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
B,Other,"Oh gosh comm "
B,Other,"I should be writing all this down . Um . "
D,Task,"Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"thinking comm 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"something other than just standard . Um "
D,Task,"so I'm wondering right away comm "
D,Minor,"is selling twenty five Euros comm is that sort of the "
D,Elicit,"thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Like how much does comm you know comm a remote control cost . "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Task,"Well twenty five Euro comm I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something comm "
B,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Or no comm "
B,Elicit,"is it as much as that ? "
B,Task,"Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I'd say so comm "
D,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm I dunno comm "
B,Task,"I've never bought a remote control comm "
B,Task,"so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um . "
D,Minor,"No . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"But yeah comm I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Um right comm okay . "
B,Other,"Let me just scoot on ahead here . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? "
D,Elicit,"Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other "
B,Minor,"Thin "
B,Task,"No comm actually . "
B,Task,"That would be useful comm though comm "
D,Minor,"other "
B,Elicit,"wouldn't it comm "
B,Task,"if you knew like what your money would get you now . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l "
D,Other,"as you point out comm "
D,Task,"I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"It just comes along . "
B,Other,"Five minutes to end of meeting . "
B,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
B,Task,"We're a bit behind . "
D,Elicit,"Do you know what I mean ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Like so sort of like how do you "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I I mean one one way of looking at it would be comm well the people producing television sets comm maybe they have to buy remote controls . "
D,Task,"Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something . "
C,Minor,"I know um "
C,Task,"My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . "
D,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"Right . Right . "
C,Task,"So um for them it was just how many devices control . "
D,Minor,"Okay so "
D,Task,"Right comm "
D,Task,"so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Right comm so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know comm "
D,Task,"I think so . "
B,Elicit,"do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well like um comm "
D,Task,"maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . "
D,Task,"They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras comm M_P_ three players comm telephones comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"everything comm agenda . "
D,Task,"So comm like comm I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"such as the lighting in your house comm or um "
B,Task,"Or even like comm you know comm notes about um what you wanna watch . "
B,Task,"Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Oh that's a good idea . "
D,Minor,"An "
B,Task,"So extra functionalities . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Like comm p personally for me comm at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . "
D,Task,"So they w all work actually function together "
D,Task,"but I have different remote controls for each of them . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there "
D,Minor,"um "
D,Task,"you know comm the sound and everything it's just one system . "
D,Task,"But each one's got its own little "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"part . "
B,Minor,"Um okay comm "
B,Minor,"uh I'd wel "
B,Task,"we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . "
B,Other,"Um I'll just check we've nothing else "
B,Task,". Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used comm "
B,Elicit,"what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ? "
A,Task,"And you keep losing them . "
B,Other,"You keep losing them . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Finding them is really a pain comm you know . "
D,Minor,"Mm . Mm . "
A,Task,"I mean it's usually quite small comm "
A,Task,"or when you want it right comm it slipped behind the couch "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"or it's kicked under the table . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"W You get those ones where you can comm if you like comm whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"You know . "
D,Minor,"That's just really good id "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"There "
B,Elicit,"I mean is that something we'd want to include comm do you think ? "
D,Minor,"Uh comm "
B,Task,"Dunno . "
D,Task,"sure . "
B,Task,"Okay maybe . "
D,Task,"I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . "
D,Task,"Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ "
D,Task,"and big like buttons that sort of like comm like on a blender or something . "
B,Other,"My goodness . "
D,Minor,"And um comm you know comm "
D,Task,"when I think about what they are now comm it's better comm "
D,Task,"but actually it's still kind of comm I dunno comm like a massive junky thing on the table . "
B,Task,"Still feels quite primitive . "
D,Task,"Maybe we could think about how comm could be more comm you know comm streamlined . S "
B,Task,"Maybe like a touch screen or something ? "
D,Task,"Something like that comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Or whatever would be technologically reasonable . "
B,Task,"Uh-huh comm okay . "
B,Task,"Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer . "
D,Minor,"'Cause it could b it could it could be that f "
D,Task,"it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better comm "
D,Task,"but that just the appeal of of not having "
B,Task,"It looks better . "
D,Task,"You know comm these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic comm you know . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um comm nicer materials "
D,Task,"and might be "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"be worth exploring anyway . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Minor,"Right comm well um "
B,Other,"so just to wrap up "
B,Task,"the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . "
B,Task,"So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . "
B,Task,"Um so inbetween now and then comm um as the industrial designer comm you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"so y you know what you're doing there . "
B,Task,"Um for user interface comm technical functions comm "
B,Task,"I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about comm "
B,Task,"what it'll actually do . "
B,Task,"Um and uh marketing executive comm "
B,Task,"you'll be just thinking about what it actually what comm you know comm what requirements it has to has to fulfil "
B,Task,"and you'll all get instructions emailed to you comm I guess . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so it's th the functional design stage is next comm I guess . "
B,Minor,"And uh "
B,Task,"and that's the end of the meeting . "
B,Task,"So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would comm so "
D,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"Before we wrap up comm just to make sure we're all on the same page here comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"um comm do we "
D,Task,"We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something comm "
B,Task,"Uh-huh comm yeah . "
D,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Minor,"um "
D,Elicit,"are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? "
D,Elicit,"Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? "
B,Minor,"Th "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"I I don't know . "
B,Task,"well just very quickly "
B,Task,"'cause this we're supposed to finish now . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Um I guess that's up to us comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
B,Task,"I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it comm "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"so um comm you know "
A,Task,"I think one factor would be production cost . "
D,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Because there's a cap there comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . Um . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think that that's the main factor . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Right comm okay comm we'll that's that's the end of the meeting comm then . Um "
D,Minor,"Alright . "
B,Minor,"So comm uh "
B,Other,"thank you all for coming . "
A,Other,"Cool . "
