B,Other,"Oops . "
A,Other,"So comm hello everyone . "
A,Task,"We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control . "
A,Task,"I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov "
A,Task,"and okay let's begin . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers "
A,Task,"and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan comm "
A,Task,"some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting . "
A,Task,"So um we want to to do a new remote control . "
A,Task,"It has to be original comm trendy and user friendly . "
A,Task,"Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design comm it's conceptual design comm and desail detailed design . "
A,Task,"and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day . "
A,Task,"Um comm so let's try the whiteboard . "
D,Other,"Wow . "
A,Elicit,"Um so any of you who want to go . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm for favourite animals . "
B,Task,"It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw . "
B,Task,"And it's gonna be you'll try to guess . "
D,Other,"Wow . "
A,Other,"Wow . "
D,Other,"Complex . "
D,Other,"Huh ? "
D,Elicit,"A cat . "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"No . Darn . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Elicit,"A rabbit . "
B,Task,"Yes comm that's a rabbit . "
D,Other,"A what ? "
B,Task,"That's my favourite one . "
A,Task,"A rabbit . "
D,Other,"A r a rabbit comm oh oh yeah comm "
C,Task,"Rabbit . "
D,Other,"where is the carrot ? "
D,Task,"Okay mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"That's it . "
A,Task,"You want to go ? "
D,Task,"I am not very good at uh this kind of stuff . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"My favourite animal is "
B,Other,"Wow . "
C,Minor,"You wa "
A,Elicit,"A human "
D,Task,"Guess . "
A,Task,"ah . "
D,Task,"A human comm yay . "
D,Task,"It's a very complex animal "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"and um yeah . "
D,Other,"Characteristics of this this animal is dangerous . "
A,Task,"Mm I think you're supposed to comm yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Is the white "
C,Task,"okay . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"I guess you can . "
B,Other,"Wow . "
B,Task,"That's cobra . "
D,Elicit,"Ah comm a kind of uh snake ? "
D,Elicit,"Cobra ? "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
C,Task,"Yeah uh not really . "
C,Task,"Small cobra . "
B,Task,"No comm it just small cobra comm yeah . "
D,Other,"Uh-huh . "
A,Elicit,"Is that a worm ? Or "
B,Task,"It's co c quite recognisable . "
D,Task,"What about you uh "
A,Other,"Uh yeah "
A,Task,"Christa Pavlov Mm . "
D,Other,"Christa ? "
C,Other,"Chris . "
B,Other,"Christa Christa . "
D,Task,"A fish . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Smiling fish . "
C,Task,"Smile fish . "
D,Task,"A smiling fish . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So comm w whiteboard is working ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Good . "
D,Task,"Next . "
A,Task,"Next . "
A,Task,"Let's talk about money . "
B,Other,"Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm well . "
B,Other,"According to the drawings . "
D,Task,"Not me . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm you're "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control . "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"mm that's the price we want to "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"that's the aim for the price for the remote control . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We aim to do this profit . "
D,Task,"'tis big number . "
B,Task,"On the international market . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we're to sell two million then . "
B,Other,"Wow . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"So any of you have experience in remote controls ? "
D,Task,"Uh yes comm we have plenty at home . "
C,Task,"Mm yeah . "
D,Task,"In fact comm my daughter likes l remote controls . "
A,Minor,"That "
B,Other,"Mm . To eat ? "
D,Other,"To eat ? Yeah comm mainly comm and to break . "
A,Task,"So that could be a great um application . "
A,Task,"Remote controls children proof . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Ye ye yeah . "
B,Minor,"Children proof . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"So she likes uh buttons which make click comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm pret "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"so it has to click . "
A,Elicit,"So they have to be waterproof maybe ? "
D,Task,"It has to be uh wha baby proof "
A,Task,"'Cause they eat she ate it . "
D,Task,"yeah "
D,Task,"but mainly it has to be very robust "
D,Task,"because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Ah . "
D,Task,"So it has to be very robust . "
B,Task,"Okay comm unbreakable . "
D,Task,"Unbreakable comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we have some child lock or something comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"And uh "
D,Task,"it has to be nice looking comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"colourful comm maybe "
A,Task,"Colourful comm yeah mm . "
B,Task,"Colourful ? That's not practical . "
D,Task,"colourful comm because uh nobody has colourful remote control "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No comm that's a good idea . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's always black or yeah . "
D,Task,"comm they're always black comm yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Mm mm-mm . "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"but this one could be I dunno comm purple or b "
B,Minor,"But how gonna "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"okay comm "
B,Elicit,"just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"because you think comm why not . "
D,Other,"One colour . "
B,Task,"Otherwise you will never find it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah even we can change colours comm no ? "
C,Minor,"Like the uh "
D,Task,"Oh like the phones comm "
C,Task,"like the phones and these things we c yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah comm it could change colours comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Cool . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"At least for children like one colour and . "
B,Minor,"Ch "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Good . "
A,Task,"Good idea . "
C,Task,"And it should be really small and . "
A,Elicit,"Small also ? "
A,Minor,"Don't you think "
C,Task,"Huh not so big like yeah . "
A,Task,"No uh comm not too much buttons or mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm not too much buttons and "
D,Task,"Should it be comm y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television comm "
D,Task,"then it's the remote control for the the sound system comm or for your refrigerator "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"whatever "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"I dunno if it's "
A,Minor,"that's "
D,Elicit,"Or if we should have a targeted re remote control . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So comm I think there's "
D,Task,"So colour comm robustness comm easy to use comm size comm "
D,Task,"yeah comm size matters comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Colour comm size comm sh "
A,Elicit,"So you you think it's better if small than bigger . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but without any extremes like n not of this size comm not too large . Okay . "
A,Task,"No comm not too small comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"at least it should hold in your hand n properly comm like . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm like a palm sized . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Just to hold it . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"But uh what would be different from this comm from the others ? "
D,Minor,"I dunno if "
C,Task,"Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm at least the colour would be different . "
C,Task,"Mm . S so then it depends "
C,Minor,"you are to "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame . "
D,Task,"I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow comm "
A,Task,"Mm . So comm some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"no screens comm it's too complex . "
A,Task,"no . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Mm . Too expensive comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Too expensive for twelve Euro ? "
B,Task,"And n maybe not too expensive comm "
A,Task,"And too expensive . "
B,Task,"well it's not my problem comm "
B,Minor,"but well okay . "
D,Minor,"Ah . "
B,Task,"But no screens on remote controls . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user . "
D,Task,"So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Ye yeah . "
D,Task,"so I would have my own design of the remote control "
D,Task,"because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Elicit,"if you if you like . "
C,Minor,"I mean it it's like "
D,Elicit,"I don't know if it makes sense comm but "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
C,Task,"it's like two types no ? "
C,Task,"people are right handed or left handed "
C,Task,"so y because I am left handed I use like this comm say if you're right handed you use like this "
D,Task,"Yeah comm for instance comm mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"or so tha your switch on and off should be on "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm mm mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"So adaptable "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"yeah something "
B,Task,"Adaptable . Alright comm good comm "
D,Task,"Maybe comm if if it's possible comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Elicit,"so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? "
C,Minor,"huh . "
C,Task,"Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working . "
B,Elicit,"On off ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We can adapt only one switch comm "
C,Task,"suppose here like we can make two switches "
C,Task,"and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . "
B,Task,"I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a "
C,Task,"Two . "
D,Elicit,"Three buttons you mean ? "
B,Task,"like three mental states comm "
A,Elicit,"Three option . "
D,Minor,"Ah . "
B,Elicit,"yeah you know what I mean comm "
B,Other,"we can just make it uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Other,"controlled by a brain comm huh ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Mm-hmm comm yeah comm sure . "
A,Task,"Maybe if it's more comm if there is a software inside "
A,Minor,"that ask you three "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may "
A,Task,"may need more than three mm three button comm three mm possibilities comm ye yeah . "
B,Task,"Sh sure comm sure . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time . "
C,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But for standard actions you usually what do you do comm you change channels comm you adjust volume comm and nothing else . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"You do this ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh no . "
B,Task,"I usually just change channels . "
D,Task,"Because I'm only using three or four channels but "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah comm you can only have one bit . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I change channel like this comm "
A,Task,"m uh I want to go to twenty five comm and then to ten comm uh-huh mm yeah . "
C,Other,"Dash . "
D,Task,"And then back to the one I was before comm "
A,Task,"Also we can be here "
D,Task,"so there's whichever it was . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah you can "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah comm that would be cool . "
B,Task,"Go back button is good . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh uh we had that in in other countries . "
B,Task,"I once had it . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah comm the previous button is . "
A,Minor,"Mm "
D,Task,"Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous . "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm okay . "
B,Minor,"History . "
C,Other,"Oh uh . "
D,Task,"Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions comm "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"that becomes more complex comm "
D,Task,"but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah comm what the which channels the viewer "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"maybe it's a "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So I think we have full of idea . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes "
A,Task,"and uh I want you to mm work on these ideas "
A,Task,"and try to make a uh the ones comm make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . "
A,Task,"And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes . "
D,Elicit,"So what does M_E_ means ? "
D,Elicit,"M_E_ the user requirements ? "
D,Elicit,"Or that's uh that's for us ? "
B,Task,"Market Expert . "
C,Task,"Marketing yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Uh that's me . "
D,Task,"Oh comm of course yeah comm "
D,Other,"the user requirement specifications comm "
D,Task,"uh-huh comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Okay . I'll think of that . "
A,Minor,"Mm okay . "
A,Minor,"So . "
D,Elicit,"So ? "
A,Task,"I think that's all . "
D,Elicit,"Meeting's over ? "
D,Task,"Great . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
B,Other,"Thank you everybody . "
A,Task,"See you in thirty minutes . "
