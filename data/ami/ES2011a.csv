A,Task,"Here we go . "
A,Other,"Welcome everybody . "
A,Task,"Um comm I'm Abigail Claflin . "
A,Task,"You can call me Abbie . "
A,Other,"'S see . PowerPoint comm that's not it . "
A,Other,"There we go . "
A,Task,"So this is our kick off meeting . Um "
A,Task,"and I guess we should all get acquainted . "
A,Task,"Let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? "
D,Task,"Hi I'm Chiara comm I'm the um Marketing Expert . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment comm or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? "
A,Task,"I think we'll get around to that comm yeah . "
D,Task,"We'll get round to that later . "
A,Task,"So this is just introductions yeah . "
D,Task,"My name is Chiara and I'm the Marketing Expert . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I forgot to s say I'm the Project Manager but I figured you all knew that already comm "
A,Minor,"um so . "
C,Task,"I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer . "
B,Task,"I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um so f here's our agenda for today . "
A,Task,"Um we're gonna do some tool training comm project plan and discuss then close . "
A,Minor,"Um so . "
A,Task,"So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original comm trendy and user friendly . "
A,Task,"And to do this comm we have to um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Task,"We'll get to that . "
A,Other,"Oh there it is . "
A,Task,"Right . Functional design comm conceptual design and detailed design . "
A,Task,"So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . "
A,Task,"Um so we're gonna try out our white board . "
A,Task,"If we'll all draw our favourite animal comm to sum up the characteristics of that animal . "
C,Elicit,"So you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? Or just draw it ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I think both . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Both . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . Why don't we do both . Right . "
D,Elicit,"Who starts ? "
D,Task,"We ought to decide who starts and all that . "
D,Elicit,"No ? "
A,Elicit,"Any volunteers ? "
D,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Elicit,"Does anyone know what they wanna draw ? "
C,Other,"Mm comm I gotta think about it for a second like . Uh "
C,Elicit,"Does it have to be functional comm trendy and user friendly ? "
A,Task,"I don't think so . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
C,Other,"Okay comm I'll draw . I'll draw one . "
C,Other,"Make sure my things here . "
C,Other,"Uh-oh . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Okay comm my favourite animal is "
C,Other,"see . "
C,Other,"Oops . "
A,Task,"A dolphin . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's "
A,Task,"'S like playing Pictionary . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I guess it has a fin on top too comm yeah . "
C,Task,"It's my dolphin . "
A,Elicit,"So what characteristics do you like about your animal ? "
C,Task,"I like its tail . "
C,Task,"Um comm no comm I think dolphins are really uh I dunno comm they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool comm like "
A,Task,"They're graceful . "
C,Task,"they're graceful yeah comm "
C,Minor,"and they're so "
A,Task,"Sleek . "
C,Task,"Yeah they're sleek "
C,Task,"and they look intelligent "
C,Minor,"and I don't know comm they're "
C,Task,"I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing . "
A,Other,"I don't know how intelligent that one looks . "
C,Task,"Yeah he he doesn't look that smart . "
C,Minor,"He's a I dunno um they're "
C,Task,"I think it's cool the the um the interaction that or the th things that the reasons people seem to like you know "
C,Task,"you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like "
C,Task,"but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals comm but they swim . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"Does anybody else wanna draw their animal ? "
B,Other,"Suppose I can draw an animal comm yeah . "
A,Minor,". "
A,Task,"Uh-oh there goes the ten . "
A,Task,"It's a cat . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"They sleep all day comm they're easy to draw . "
A,Elicit,"Do you wanna anything ? "
D,Other,"Uh yeah . "
A,Minor,"I dunno if the the "
D,Task,"Well I had the cat as well comm but uh I've got a spare one . "
B,Task,"I think the pen is running out of "
A,Minor,"ah . "
D,Other,"So I'll use the spare one . "
D,Task,"Um but it's harder to draw um . "
C,Task,"And the pen's dying . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"A horse . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Task,"Horse . "
D,Task,"Um I don't really know how the legs go comm "
A,Task,"That's very good . "
D,Other,"but anyway I will do that . "
D,Task,"Um comm and the main reason is they're pretty . "
D,Task,"I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment comm "
D,Task,"and I like the way they run "
D,Task,"and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . "
D,Task,"And I like the way um they feel comm sort of under under the hand comm "
D,Task,"I think that's pretty much it . "
D,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"This cord's "
A,Minor,"Uh . Right . "
A,Task,"Actually I haven't thought of anything yet . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"It's a pig . "
A,Other,"So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's "
A,Other,"water resistant comm strong and furry . "
A,Elicit,"What do you think comm yeah ? "
C,Other,"And furry . "
A,Minor,"This is "
A,Task,"yeah comm well like a cat comm you know comm soft yeah . "
C,Task,"Textile tactile comm tactile remote control . "
A,Minor,"Although "
A,Other,"uh I'll just put there . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"You're dragging a you have a tail . "
A,Task,"Oh my gosh comm this is disastrous . "
A,Other,"Sorry about that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So moving on . "
A,Task,"Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro "
A,Task,"and profit aim is fifty million Euro . "
A,Task,"So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland comm we're in some European country . "
A,Task,"Um comm and we will hope to sell this internationally . "
C,Elicit,"Sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ? "
A,Task,"Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"How many should we sell then ? "
D,Task,"Um comm a lot comm "
A,Elicit,"Anyone a mathematician ? "
D,Task,"two two two million comm "
D,Task,"two mi no comm "
D,Task,"more f four million . "
B,Elicit,"Two million . "
D,Task,"Four million . "
D,Minor,"And it "
D,Task,"well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty comm that'll do four million . "
B,Task,"Oh comm yeah . "
D,Task,"It is a lot . Uh . "
A,Task,"So f that's a fifty percent um uh . "
A,Task,"Um comm I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . "
A,Task,"Experience with remote control . "
A,Task,"So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient comm practical comm nice remote control . "
A,Elicit,"Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have . "
D,Task,"Um comm I think one thing is that it should be easy to find "
C,Task,"I was thinking that too . "
D,Minor,"bec yeah bec "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you "
C,Task,"I mean you always know where your T_V_ is comm so just have a call button comm "
C,Task,"I've always wanted that comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah yeah yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"so like you can push a button on your T_V_ "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I mean you have it for the portable phone comm so why not yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah yeah yeah comm "
C,Task,"so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And even I think a little light . "
D,Task,"Um or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing . "
D,Task,"I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"In which case you're going to be l "
D,Task,"but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound "
D,Task,"I don't know if it's expensive maybe to "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I don't yeah I mean it but like I mean "
D,Task,"Maybe call is enough . "
D,Other,"But yeah . "
C,Task,"just I mean like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate comm it can light up and make noise and I dunno "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it "
A,Minor,"and you could "
A,Task,"I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You know like a portable phone has a base comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"or if it had a "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Task,"like just to have a home for it . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I mean "
A,Task,"'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ comm but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ comm so "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well that's why it's always in the couch . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm in in the couch . "
C,Task,"I dunno comm "
C,Task,"it seems like though that that would be hard comm 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . "
C,Other,"Yeah so we the project is now couches and remote controls . "
D,Task,"But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing comm a pretty object attached to the wall . "
D,Task,"But that would really make it more expensive . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But it's only a plastic thing comm r really comm the thing on the wall . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Something like that . "
D,Minor,"And the other thing is "
A,Elicit,"Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose comm or does that not factor in ? "
C,Other,"Bigger . "
D,Minor,"Not "
D,Task,"well it needs to be sort of "
A,Minor,"Like "
A,Minor,"Hand "
C,Task,"Hand-sized . "
A,Task,"hand held size comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't think you need a "
A,Task,"Not not huge comm but "
D,Task,"But definitely not well I don't know . "
C,Task,"It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it . "
D,Task,"No comm it can't be comm uh-uh . "
B,Task,"No it really wouldn't be . "
C,Task,"Or like or like a light thing . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Other,"You know . I dunno "
D,Task,"Like spaceship . "
C,Task,". Yeah . "
C,Other,"Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah . "
C,Minor,"That would be really "
C,Other,"I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop . "
A,Other,"Little homing device . Um . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Uh . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So what do we think this remote control should "
A,Task,"Five minutes . "
D,Task,"Oh dear . "
A,Other,"Till the meeting oh right . "
A,Task,"This is what we have left . "
C,Task,"I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons comm "
A,Minor,"Um comm oh we just "
C,Task,"'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I agree . "
B,Task,"B_ button and the F_ button comm they don't do anything . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean I know it has to have enough functions "
C,Task,"but like comm I don't know you comm just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like comm no comm you never use half of them . So . "
A,Minor,"You "
A,Task,"what if um may be a little fancy "
A,Task,"but what if it had like a little screen comm so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . "
C,Task,"That would be cool . "
A,Task,"Like the way a mobile phone does . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I mean it just seems like "
A,Task,"So you could like um like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels comm you can the way you do it on your radio is that you uh "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"what do you call it "
D,Task,"Select . Uh . "
A,Task,"s y yeah but you can programme comm "
A,Task,"so you can programme like your favourite channels comm "
A,Minor,"so like if you had a s "
D,Elicit,"But comm would you have the screen on the thing comm or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . "
A,Task,"That's something we could decide . Mm . "
C,Task,"I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno . "
D,Minor,"Because "
D,Minor,"Because comm I don't know if it's "
D,Task,"I think it's e expensive comm "
D,Minor,"if you have "
D,Task,"if you use the telly screen comm 'cause the telly's already a screen comm then you can pro sort of have a programming function comm really easy sort of arrow up and down comm on the remote comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and then use the telly as a screen . "
A,Task,"Right . "
D,Minor,"But um "
C,Minor,"I'm thinking kind of "
D,Task,"But yeah for sure . "
D,Task,"Something like not it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"is that what you mean ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Right . Mm . "
C,Task,"Or like you h you see those you know people "
C,Task,"I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know "
C,Task,"their their entire house is so electronic comm "
C,Task,"and they have like this one master control that "
C,Task,"and it's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control "
C,Task,"and it has like a screen and like "
C,Task,"so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen comm "
C,Minor,"I don't know if it must be it would probably "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"must be ex too expensive though t "
C,Task,"like I dunno . "
D,Task,"But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . Yeah that's true . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I mean comm we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Um but it's something to think about comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Well comm I guess we have to get to that later comm yeah . "
A,Task,"I mean we'll have to see how much that would be . "
D,Minor,"Or some it i "
D,Task,"we can find out probably on the internet how much it's "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um . Yeah comm "
D,Task,"and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um "
D,Elicit,"What was the word ? "
C,Task,"Furry . "
D,Task,"Water resistant . "
A,Minor,"Oh I was just "
D,Minor,"No but it's "
D,Task,"I thought comm ah comm spot on . "
D,Task,"Good feel comm tact tactile comm good tactile feel comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Mm comm mm . "
D,Task,"That's quite annoying . "
A,Task,"Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it comm like so you can clip it to your "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"like that's another "
D,Task,"Yeah comm clip . "
D,Other,"Ooh . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Um . We should probably start wrapping up comm "
A,Task,"um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . "
A,Task,"Um comm and come up with some new ones for the next meeting comm "
A,Task,"which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"The Industrial Designer comm "
A,Elicit,"what does that stand for comm I_D_ comm "
B,Task,"Yeah I think so . "
A,Task,"yeah "
A,Task,"um is going to be looking more into the working design . "
A,Task,"So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . "
A,Task,"The "
A,Task,"something comm "
A,Elicit,"what is the U_I_ ? "
B,Task,"User . "
C,Task,"That's me . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah comm what does it stand for again ? "
C,Task,"Uh comm User Interface design . "
A,Other,"User Interface Designer . "
A,Task,"So that's gonna be "
A,Task,"more technical . "
A,Task,"I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w "
C,Task,"So technical function . "
B,Task,"The working design is the structure . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Elicit,"What is technical functions exactl "
C,Task,"I I don't really know what "
A,Task,"Um comm I guess you'd have to find out . "
D,Task,"It says on that email but it "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"It was in the email . "
C,Task,"It does but it I just don't really "
B,Task,"I wrote down what mine were . "
D,Minor,"It said um "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"It said "
C,Task,"What effect should the thing ha should it have comm "
C,Task,"okay . Alright . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"like "
C,Task,"And working design . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Be a medium between you and the telly I think comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . Alright . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"that's uh "
C,Task,"And how it works comm "
C,Task,"okay . Right . "
C,Task,"I'm I'm on task . "
A,Elicit,"And the M_E_ comm what does that stand for ? M "
B,Task,"Marketing . "
A,Other,"Marketing comm right . Um . "
D,Task,"Marketing . Oh it's written here comm but um . "
A,Task,"So we'll be working on the user requirements comm um "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So I guess that wraps it up . "
A,Task,"I'll see you all in thirty minutes . "
A,Other,"I just did . "
