D,Elicit,"Uh where has my screen gone ? "
C,Other,"Hi . "
B,Other,"Hello comm good day . "
C,Other,"Oh yeah comm "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"we have to talk in English comm "
C,Elicit,"huh . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"My screen is gone . "
D,Task,"Oh . "
A,Task,"It's called black . "
B,Other,"Kick-off meeting comm wow . "
C,Task,"I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff uh . "
B,Task,"It's uh looks uh nice . "
B,Other,"Hmm ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow . "
C,Elicit,"I don't know how much preparation you guys did comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but not a lot . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"No comm it's it was uh not enough . "
A,Task,"You see this beautiful presentation . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Very nice . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,"let's get started . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh I sort of prepared this . "
A,Task,"Uh opening acquaintance comm tool training comm uh how to use the things here . Uh project plan discussion comm and yeah then the rest of the meeting . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control comm "
A,Task,"that's both original comm trendy and user-friendly . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Other,"hope you have good ideas . "
A,Other,"I don't . "
B,Other,"I did my best . "
A,Task,"Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design comm "
C,Other,"Not yet . "
A,Task,"then we do some in individual work comm "
A,Task,"then we have a meeting to discuss the results comm etcetera etcetera . "
A,Task,"And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up . "
A,Task,"Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um "
A,Task,"uh we should take some practice . "
A,Task,"I have some instructions now to do that . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh well "
A,Task,"you know how to the documents work . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um "
A,Task,"we have a pen . "
A,Task,"And we can use this pen to perform . "
C,Other,"Operations . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"It doesn't always work . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay so "
A,Task,"you can draw . "
D,Other,"Draw . Alright . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,"and in the format menu you can select colour and line width comm etcetera etcetera . "
D,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Minor,"Uh Okay . "
A,Task,"Each of you can uh take some practice "
A,Task,"and you should draw an animal . Uh you should explain Uh with different colours and with different pen widths . "
A,Task,"And you should explain why you draw that particular animal . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"Julian . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Don't take up too much space . "
B,Other,"Um yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Different pen widths comm how do you do that ? "
A,Task,"Uh with the format menu . "
C,Other,"Oh okay . "
A,Task,"And use different colours etcetera . "
C,Other,"Are you serious ? "
A,Elicit,"And what's that supposed to be ? "
B,Task,"It's a giraffe . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Should it be one "
A,Other,"Oh yeah . Oh yeah "
A,Task,"four legs . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"Giraffe's yellow . "
B,Task,"Uh it needs some uh some yellow uh Oh format . "
D,Elicit,"Can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? Or "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"so y you must save it at the end "
D,Minor,"and then "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"you can press the next button comm "
A,Minor,"which is uh "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"That's some spots . "
A,Other,"I'll show you . "
C,Task,"I in the file option menu . "
A,Task,"Yeah . In file menu . "
D,Other,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"then m make a new one . "
B,Other,"No . "
C,Elicit,"How much time do we have to draw anyway ? "
C,Task,"'Cause I can take forever on this . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Do I have to explain uh why I chose this uh this animal ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think it's a it's a great animal . "
A,Elicit,"What is it ? "
B,Task,"It's a it's a giraffe . "
A,Other,"A giraffe okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"that's a "
A,Task,"I see a long neck "
A,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"It's more like a dinosaur . "
B,Minor,"Um Okay "
B,Other,"I'll will give it an uh an eye . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Other,"That's nice of you . "
B,Other,"Hey . Come on . "
D,Other,"Some leaf to eat . "
A,Other,"Okay . Yeah pretty good . "
A,Elicit,"Uh could you press the next uh "
B,Other,"The next ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Then uh . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Here you go . "

A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Other,"sorry comm "
A,Other,"introduction and get acquainted "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Minor,"and "
C,Other,"Alright . "
A,Task,"That's the idea comm "
A,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"Uh . Your line broke . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Alright . "
D,Task,"It's not that fast . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"it's a bit slow comm "
A,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"I see . "
D,Task,"It misses the spot . "
A,Task,"pressure . "
C,Task,"I'm guessing a turtle . "
C,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"I'm kidding . "
D,Task,"I say good guess . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
A,Elicit,"Why a turtle ? "
C,Task,"Because of its shell . "
D,Task,"Because it's slow . "
A,Task,"It's slow . "
B,Other,"'Cause it's so "
B,Task,"'cause it's green . "
A,Task,"You were slow too "
A,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"Yeah I was a bit slow too . "
C,Other,"Dude you're a good drawer . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Other,"Uh some other line uh width uh "
C,Elicit,"Do you have a turtle pet ? "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"Uh okay . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
D,Elicit,"Does it have legs ? "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah sure . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Yeah not exactly legs but More like fins "
C,Task,"Stumpy stuff . "
A,Minor,"or "
D,Task,"It's more like a tank . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"that's fins "
D,Task,"but I don't know where . "
C,Task,"They kind of l look like mole legs . With sharp nails on . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Some spots . "
D,Other,"Ah some eye . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"it's l looks very friendly . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's a fr friendly turtle I guess . "
D,Minor,"Yeah well "
D,Task,"I think it's uh fair enough . "
A,Task,"Yeah okay . "
C,Task,"A little tail maybe . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Task,"I don't know what the position is . "
D,Elicit,"Does it have ears ? "
C,Task,"Uh no . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Elicit,"No . Oh okay . "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"The little holes maybe . "
D,Elicit,"Can you erase ears "
D,Minor,"or "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
D,Other,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"There's a a gum comm "
D,Other,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"gum to . "
D,Task,"Eraser . "
C,Elicit,"And why did you choose this animal ? "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"He said it was slow . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
D,Task,"I it just came into my mind . "
D,Task,"So there's no particular reason "
C,Other,"Alright . "
D,Minor,"I pen . "
A,Task,"I like it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"I'm guess I'm done . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"That's my turtle . "
A,Task,"Your turn Niels . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
D,Elicit,"How to select the next or "
A,Other,"The next "
D,Task,"here . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Here you go . "
A,Task,"Makes new paper . "
C,Task,"Colours were under format "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Let's see . "
A,Other,"Orange . "
C,Elicit,"How am I gonna do this ? Um "
C,Other,"Mm uh . "
B,Task,"A rabbit I think . "
A,Task,"Kangaroo . "
B,Minor,"Kangaroo . "
C,Task,"Not quite actually . "
B,Task,"Fox . "
D,Task,"A fox yeah . "
D,Other,"Firefox . "
A,Task,"Dog . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Cat . "
C,Task,"Aye . "
A,Task,"It's a cat . "
C,Task,"It's a cat . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Not quite yet through . "
D,Other,"A cat who had an accident or "
A,Elicit,"Why a cat ? "
C,Minor,"Uh yeah "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
C,Task,"They're my favourite pets . "
A,Elicit,"You have some uh ? "
C,Other,"Uh I have colour already . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Other,"I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of "
C,Minor,"st "
C,Other,"Oh shit . Um "
A,Task,"The pen comm "
A,Other,"yeah . "
C,Other,"Excuse my language . "
A,Other,"Sure . "
C,Task,"I don't know how to draw its face . "
C,Task,"But you get the idea . "
C,Task,"It's a cat . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Alright . "
C,Task,"It's my favourite uh pet animal comm "
C,Task,"'cause they're cute comm they're independent and cuddly comm "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"That's it . "
C,Elicit,"Or do I need to use more colours "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"I think it's okay . "
C,Other,"Alright . "
A,Task,"You get idea "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Minor,"Okay um "
A,Other,"we have a financial aspect to this project . "
A,Task,"Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh "
A,Task,"the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . "
A,Task,"Uh that's quite a big amount of money . "
A,Task,"And the production cost should be the half of the selling price . "
C,Minor,"So we have to s "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,"now it's time for some discussion . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Elicit,"What uh what uh do you want to discuss ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We should get started . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Other,"Uh I'm taking notes . Um "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Great . "
A,Task,"we each have a specific task comm "
A,Task,"as I saw in my mail . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"I didn't know if you received the same mail . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I guess so . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay so the um uh "
A,Task,"this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . "
A,Elicit,"Am I correct ? "
C,Task,"True . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . "
A,Elicit,"Right ? Yeah ? "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh did any of you already do some work on this part "
A,Minor,"or "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I started making an overview for myself comm um what I had to do comm "
C,Task,"'cause we have three design steps "
C,Task,"and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So I had to uh comm I dunno comm make an overview for myself about what I have to do comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I started I started with the first phase comm "
C,Task,"I think was the functional . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"And uh let's see "
C,Task,"I had to focus on the working design comm which you said . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"How does the apparatus work ? "
C,Minor,"And well "
C,Task,"I basically had two points . "
C,Task,"Uh according to the coffee uh machine example comm I have batteries to supply energy comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
C,Task,"And that's basically all I have so far . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Other,"I got another point . "
A,Task,"It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Wireless uh huh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Alright . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"that's very common . "
B,Task,"Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . "
B,Task,"You d you already told that . "
B,Task,"And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume . "
B,Task,"That are the the basic options for a remote control . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"I kept it global "
C,Minor,"'cause "
C,Task,"that it activates or deactivates specific functions comm "
C,Task,"'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . "
B,Other,"Okay comm yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean comm you wanna ch ch flip the channel "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"but you might wanna use teletext also . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"I dunno what the word is in English . Uh "
A,Task,"Same I believe . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ? "
D,Minor,"Uh well "
D,Task,"from a marketing uh perspective comm um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"I mean comm what functions do they have . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Um especially what are their shortcomings ? "
D,Task,"Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support comm and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
D,Task,"So we can see uh what needs to be supported . "
D,Task,"Um and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"uh I'm thinking of early adopters comm "
D,Task,"because they they use new technology first comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and they play with a lot of tools and stuff "
D,Task,"so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And you can get that information ? "
D,Task,"I think I can get that information comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"That would be very handy . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ? "
D,Task,"No n not specifically . "
D,Task,"More to how to get them "
A,Minor,"No ? "
D,Minor,"and "
A,Other,"No okay . "
B,Task,"I got some uh requirements "
B,Task,"it has uh it has to be user-friendly . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Obviously . "
A,Task,"Of course . "
B,Task,"Uh really easy to use buttons comm "
B,Task,"not not uh very small buttons comm "
B,Task,"but not the the also the big big buttons comm "
B,Task,"but just normal buttons . "
B,Task,"It has to be a small unit . "
B,Minor,"It has to be uh "
B,Minor,"yeah comm "
B,Task,"you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . "
B,Task,"So it has n has not to be l yeah comm gigantic uh machine . "
A,Task,"Big comm "
A,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh and a and a good uh zapping range . "
A,Elicit,"Uh what do you mean by that ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be comm uh yeah um yeah comm quite a big distance . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It has to be capable for zapping uh "
D,Elicit,"From the other end of the room or something ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay um Well "
A,Task,"I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment . "
A,Task,"Um I think the best is to go to work . "
C,Other,"Whoa . "
C,Elicit,"Is that you "
C,Minor,"or "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"alright . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Any more points to discuss ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think we can go ahead with what we have . "
A,Other,"I will summarise the things we discussed "
A,Other,"and put it in the project folder . "
A,Task,"Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design comm etcetera etcetera . "
A,Task,"And it seems you get more information by email . "
D,Other,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Other,"Alright . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"that was it for me . "
D,Other,"'Kay . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Elicit,"Are you going to put the the notes on the "
A,Task,"Yeah comm in the project folder . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"The pro okay . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Alright . "
A,Task,"I'm writing very fast . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Okay . "
A,Other,"Hope it's readable . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Elicit,"Okay "
D,Task,"I guess so . "
A,Elicit,"um anything more you want to add to the discussion ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"no "
C,Elicit,"I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Do we only have to to do uh phase one comm the functional design uh ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Because then we have a "
B,Elicit,"After that we are going to the conceptual uh "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"We're just working the three phases . "
A,Task,"Y you do some individual work comm "
A,Task,"we have meeting comm "
A,Task,"individual work comm meeting . "
A,Task,"And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . "
A,Task,"And then I have to prepare uh I have to defend our design comm "
A,Task,"so make it good . "
C,Task,"Yeah okay . We'll do our best . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I depend on you . "
D,Minor,"Better make it "
C,Other,"I am gonna work on the conceptual design already "
C,Task,"'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . "
A,Task,"Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Do we "
C,Elicit,"I mean comm is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? "
C,Elicit,"Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . That is my question also "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"because like new new functions "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"I think that is the user requirements part . "
D,Task,"Requirements . Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small "
C,Task,"Yeah . True . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But but we need good communication about this stuff comm "
D,Task,"Unit . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"'cause I have to f put the components into the design . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"I would first m "
C,Task,"So if I don't know what components to put in comm it's kind of hard . "
D,Minor,"Yeah well "
D,Minor,"I I was "
A,Other,"Yeah I understand . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I I think we have first to start with the basic functions "
D,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"and we can uh expand them . "
D,Minor,"well "
A,Task,"You can always add a few "
D,Task,"like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there comm which I know comm there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So you can switch to your video "
D,Task,"and then the same buttons control your video . "
A,Task,"Hmm comm "
A,Task,"the C_D_ player . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre comm "
D,Task,"because that's getting very popular . "
C,Minor,"Yeah so "
D,Task,"And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch comm one single switch "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Yeah I I know what you mean comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . "
D,Minor,"S "
C,Task,"You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"records and stuff like that . "
C,Task,"And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well comm "
A,Task,"You need additional "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so I kind of need to know what we uh need . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Whatever comm I'll just put my ideas in uh in here "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting . "
D,Minor,"In the project uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . "
A,Task,"And um reserve the possibility to add other features . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So we have a basic starting point "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"and you can always extend that "
A,Task,"so make sure it's extendible . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Alright . "
B,Task,"it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . "
B,Minor,"So it's hasn't it's yeah . "
A,Task,"Th the least amount of functions possible "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"I understand . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Minor,"Okay "
C,Task,"Alright . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Can we leave now "
D,Task,"Half an hour . "
B,Minor,"or "
A,Task,"Yeah comm you're di dismissed . "
C,Other,"Thanks . "
D,Other,"You're fired . "
A,Other,"Not yet . "
D,Minor,"No . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Other,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Alright "
