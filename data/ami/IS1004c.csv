Speaker,DialogAct,Text
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Other,"Good afternoon . "
A,Other,"Hope you have good lunch . "
C,Other,"Afternoon . "
B,Other,"Hi . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"we had falafel . "
A,Task,"Oh . Nice . "
A,Elicit,"And you ? "
B,Task,"Uh comm yes comm I had something similar but non-vegetarian . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So today is um our third meeting . "
A,Task,"It will be about the conceptual design uh . "
A,Other,"If I come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings "
A,Task,"um . We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons "
A,Task,"and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs . "
A,Task,"So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . "
A,Task,"Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . "
A,Task,"So I hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us . "
A,Task,"So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform "
A,Elicit,"um who starts ? "
D,Other,"Okay comm . "
A,Task,"So marketing . "
A,Minor,"So you are "
A,Elicit,"you saved your y your presentation somewhere ? "
D,Task,"Yep . "
A,Elicit,"So you're four ? "
D,Task,"Four comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Which is trend watch . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Mr Marketing Experts . "
D,Task,"Yeah that's me . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"Uh . Well I investigate the preference more d "
D,Task,"I investigate deeper the preference of the users . "
D,Minor,"Uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh "
D,Other,"sorry "
D,Minor,"the current "
D,Minor,"the n "
D,Elicit,"current trends ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Well wha what I found "
D,Task,"um can you "
A,Elicit,"Next slide ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Task,"What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . "
D,Task,"After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking comm "
D,Minor,"but the most "
D,Task,"what they what they find more more interesting comm more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . "
D,Task,"So now more more cool aspect comm ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with "
D,Task,"instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things comm a device which is pleasant to to watch comm to see . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Uh also "
D,Minor,"Well in in Euro in in Paris and and Milan the "
D,Task,"in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of uh of clothes comm furniture and all this "
D,Task,"all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And also in the in the U_S_A_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy . "
D,Task,"Spongy means eponge ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So maybe we should we should think in in this direction comm so "
B,Elicit,"What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ? "
B,Elicit,"What you mean clothe "
C,Minor,"Spongy means it it's like sp "
D,Minor,"Fruit vegetables is the the new "
D,Elicit,"have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ? "
B,Task,"No comm I missed that one . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm I I didn't miss an "
D,Task,"I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit comm there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . "
B,Other,"Oh comm they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot "
B,Other,"they just have like pictures of fruit on comm okay . "
D,Task,"No no comm not not yet comm not yet . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana comm "
D,Task,"So te textu textures comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"just maybe "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Vegetable textures and all this kind . "
A,Task,"Drawings of bananas . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"Okay and "
A,Other,"Uh-huh . "
D,Minor,"yeah comm yeah . "
C,Elicit,"But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? "
A,Task,"Well so this is in the next slide certainly . "
D,Task,"Uh no no comm it's not . "
A,Other,"It's not ? "
D,Minor,"It's "
B,Elicit,"So which fruit are you thinking of ? "
D,Minor,"And "
D,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit comm "
D,Task,"but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable comm "
D,Minor,"some kind of "
D,Task,"instead of vegetable comm some natur mm uh natural object or something . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"But yeah it it depends on the "
A,Task,"So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_ . "
B,Elicit,"Oh comm so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit comm "
B,Elicit,"or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the "
C,Task,"Means buttons are in the shape of fruits comm "
D,Task,"Yeah maybe the shape the shape "
C,Task,"buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something comm apple comm banana comm something like that . "
D,Task,"No comm not n not not too much focus comm not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . "
A,Other,"Apple for channel one . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"So we shouldn't be at re really attached "
D,Task,"to to the trend "
B,Other,"So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant . "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Other,"For instance comm yeah . "
D,Other,"African or as an elephant ? "
C,Other,"That we can discuss afterwards . "
B,Minor,"But okay comm "
B,Task,"I'm not comm I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"maybe just to fashion gurus comm "
B,Task,"like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner comm "
B,Minor,"but I don't know about "
B,Task,"uh I dunno how ergonomic a comm an orange is . "
D,Task,"Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing . "
D,Task,"I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people "
D,Task,"because they are more open to new devi new devices "
B,Elicit,"To fruit ? "
D,Task,"and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was "
D,Task,"was was able to "
D,Task,"to buy a a n a cooler remote control . "
B,Elicit,"But is it uh is fruit cool ? "
D,Other,"What ? "
A,Task,"That's a question . "
D,Other,"What ? "
B,Elicit,"Is fruit cool ? "
D,Other,"Yeah ? "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Is the new trend "
D,Minor,"of the "
B,Task,"Well I guess comm you know comm Apple has the iPod so comm "
B,Minor,"imagi "
B,Task,"just 'cause they have an apple on their "
B,Task,"on their product comm doesn't mean fruit is cool . "
D,Task,"No I think we we should think about a a shape with it "
D,Minor,"a device with a shape of some "
B,Task,"Okay comm but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know comm "
B,Task,"you don't wanna pear or a watermelon . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ? "
B,Task,"Well comm probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of comm "
C,Minor,"Banana . "
B,Task,"a cucumber . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
D,Minor,"Or m "
A,Task,"Maybe too long . "
B,Task,"Maybe . "
B,Task,"Too green . "
D,Task,"Maybe . "
B,Task,"So comm but I mean you also have to you have to also have comm fit r all the buttons and you know . "
A,Task,"A banana . "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"It's comm it "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"The thing is you have t normally with um with buttons comm they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board "
B,Task,"so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build . "
C,Minor,"I don't th "
C,Task,"it will be rolling a lot . "
D,Task,"Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ? "
A,Elicit,"Well comm you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not . "
B,Minor,"Well comm this is "
D,Minor,"I think "
D,Task,"Well comm according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation comm "
D,Task,"so comm I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"So you you you suggest to go f "
D,Task,"new inputs "
D,Task,"and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ "
D,Task,"because you need uh internet connection comm you need more things comm "
D,Task,"it's not just buying a new control re remote comm you need buying control remote comm buying uh "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"more things . "
A,Minor,"S so you're simply "
D,Task,"It's not so simple . "
A,Task,"you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons . "
D,Task,"For instance comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah for for for given an an example yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay good . "
A,Task,"So maybe you can go ahead ? "
D,Task,"Yeah no comm it's what I already said . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Thanks . Um . "
A,Other,"Okay comm I'll give the floor . "
A,Task,"So you are User Interface guy . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So you're three ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And it's this one . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Go for it . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Okay . So . "
B,Task,"S next uh slide . "
B,Task,"Okay . So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit comm "
B,Task,"um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control . "
C,Elicit,"But it's just a speaker right ? "
B,Minor,"It's "
B,Task,"no comm "
B,Task,"what it is comm it's it's very "
C,Task,"It's not a microphone . "
B,Task,"It has a has a microphone comm "
B,Task,"has a speaker comm it's got a little chip "
B,Minor,"and it allows you t "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Actually I'm not reading microphone there comm "
C,Task,"so that's why you can all have conversation comm it just to speak to you . "
B,Task,"Well comm it's a sample sensor sample speaker . "
B,Task,"Sample sensor sample speaker . "
B,Task,"It means that it can recognize comm it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"But uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So comm I mean comm you know comm "
B,Task,"I guess you could build that in comm you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"But basically the thing is comm we have this technology available "
C,Elicit,"In-house . "
B,Task,"in-house . "
B,Minor,"So comm um "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"so um it it "
B,Task,"but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Whilst you know comm some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it comm "
A,Minor,"I "
A,Task,"there's something that I unclear really understanding . "
A,Elicit,"Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ? "
B,Minor,"It's it it's no comm well comm "
B,Task,"it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords comm but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . "
B,Task,"You train it for a certain uh comm for a certain phrase comm "
B,Minor,"you say "
B,Task,"the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um "
B,Task,"well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is comm "
B,Task,"you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning comm how would you like your coffee ? "
A,Elicit,"And it's just to comm it's just to playback something ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So actually that was a bad example comm "
B,Task,"'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response comm so . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
A,Elicit,"So this is not s really to do to to do control . "
B,Task,"Only comm like comm only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"This is just more like a poi pois yeah . "
B,Task,"It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
B,Minor,"but I guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh "
A,Minor,"So it it's c uh it it "
D,Minor,"Yeah but you can u "
A,Task,"it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh "
B,Task,"Completely pointless yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm unless you know comm you like having conversation with your remote control . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah but the can we use it for saying okay comm channel fifty comm channel twenty ? "
B,Task,"Well yeah comm that's the thing comm "
B,Minor,"if "
B,Task,"you can but you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination comm "
B,Task,"you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen comm that whole thing comm "
B,Task,"not just the word channel and the word fifteen comm it doesn't have that kind of logic in it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology comm bringing it to the remote control and using it . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that would be some development work . "
A,Task,"So this is out of discussion . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control "
D,Task,"M Mando . "
B,Task,"Banana-mando . "
A,Task,"No this is mm banana-bando comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Banana-mando yeah . "
B,Other,"Banana-man "
A,Task,"Uh then it could be cool yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah okay comm "
C,Task,"let's go ahead . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I uh I I I don't think it's worth it though comm "
B,Task,"I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine comm so "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um comm yeah . "
B,Task,"So if we can just move on to the next slide comm "
B,Task,"I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control "
A,Task,"It doesn't look like a banana at all . "
B,Task,"Well comm you see comm I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"um comm so at the moment it's more of a box focus . "
A,Minor,"But you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to "
D,Task,"Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm well comm this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes . "
B,Task,"But um comm I've just indicated here comm we could have actually two scroll wheels comm "
B,Task,"'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of comm you know comm "
C,Task,"Stable thing comm that's right . To have comm "
B,Task,"I think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing comm so . "
C,Minor,"mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"But I think it's important comm you know comm to have two scroll wheels because comm you know comm you want one for for the channel comm but you also want one for for the volume comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"because it's it's the volume i it's comm you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response comm so . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"But um comm "
B,Task,"I've also included this turbo button "
B,Task,"because I think comm you know comm every design should have a turbo button comm "
D,Elicit,"What's a turbo button ? "
B,Minor,"and well "
B,Task,"so this is you know comm a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television comm the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll comm "
B,Task,"so you know comm the th the person might want to have a uh "
B,Task,"Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them comm "
B,Task,"in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then comm you know comm displays that station . "
B,Task,"Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it comm even if it lags behind what they're doing . "
D,Elicit,"It con it controls the speed ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"so with this turbo button you can comm say comm skip over t channels if uh comm you know comm if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them "
B,Task,"and you know comm it's um comm you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever . "
B,Minor,"So yeah comm that's um comm "
B,Task,"those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need comm um . "
B,Task,"You know comm i it could be comm you know comm if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device comm "
B,Task,"I mean comm we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very comm if it's gonna be a banana comm you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality comm "
B,Task,"it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana "
A,Task,"It's enough . "
B,Minor,"and it's still very "
B,Task,"it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote comm but if they have these scroll wheels comm "
B,Elicit,"so comm um you know comm what other buttons do we want ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"I mean we could have "
B,Task,"well comm I guess you need an on and off switch comm "
A,Task,"Switch on . Yeah . "
B,Task,"but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe comm you know comm "
B,Task,"it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So sounds crazy . "
D,Task,"I like crazy ideas . "
B,Task,"That's why you're a marketing guru . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
A,Task,"So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing . "
B,Task,"Well comm that's the thing comm "
B,Minor,"as "
B,Elicit,"have we decided that we can only spend comm uh comm twenty five Euro ? "
A,Minor,"I think that "
B,Task,"Well not spend comm but you know comm charge twenty five Euro . "
D,Task,"I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so . "
A,Task,"No we can we can't use that . "
D,Minor,"You "
D,Other,"we can ? We can't . "
A,Task,"We can't use that to "
C,Task,"Communicate . "
A,Task,"to comman co communicate comm "
A,Minor,"it's just a thing "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but we can say channel twenty five . "
C,Task,"It's one way . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Other,"No ? "
B,Task,"But then you have to have a template for every channel comm for a hundred channels comm "
B,Minor,"you have to be able to to recognize "
D,Task,"It's not a lot one hundred templates comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"it's not "
B,Task,"Well comm I f I think it's probably more than comm than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine comm you know comm to say hello in the morning . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Ah comm it's designed for a cof okay . "
D,Elicit,"Is it design for a coffee machine ? "
B,Task,"Well that's its current application comm "
B,Task,"I would presume that it's kind of comm they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Maybe you could ask your the "
D,Task,"you could ask the engineering department if we can "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . A good good good thing . "
B,Minor,"But uh "
A,Elicit,"You want to g to move to your slides ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's right comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"You're finished ? "
B,Task,"Well I just I just made the point comm "
B,Task,"I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is comm you know comm even if we can do it comm I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment . "
A,Task,"Yeah I think so . "
B,Task,"But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting comm "
B,Task,"you were talking about um being able to find the remote control "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know comm a base station that can control other things as well . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"It might be useful to have some kind of base station comm "
B,Task,"even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping comm you know comm this is a way of finding the remote . "
B,Task,"Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Exactly yeah . "
B,Task,"but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping "
C,Elicit,"So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing comm "
C,Task,"something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out . "
B,Minor,"It's speech "
B,Task,"It's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of comm not really speech recognition comm but kind of pattern matching comm yeah "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . That's right . "
A,Task,"Oh comm good idea . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Very good . "
A,Task,"Okay comm let's move on . "
A,Elicit,"So you're two ? "
C,Task,"That's right . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So this is going to be about the component design . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . "
C,Task,"So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies comm "
C,Task,"one is the usual batteries which are there comm "
C,Task,"they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing "
C,Task,"and on top of that we can have solar cells comm "
C,Task,"when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind . "
C,Task,"Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces comm "
C,Task,"there should be some flexibility in t "
B,Task,"I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So there should "
C,Task,"we should think of something like that "
C,Task,"and then it should be double curve . "
C,Task,"The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . "
C,Task,"Then controls "
C,Task,"for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them . "
B,Other,"So comm just one second comm "
B,Elicit,"when you say double curve comm what do you actually mean ? "
B,Task,"You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the comm on the whiteboard "
C,Task,"Double curve is comm you have curves on both the sides if I'm right . "
B,Task,"'cause I'm not sure "
C,Task,"So it's symmetrical kind of thing comm whatever it is . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Elicit,"but like comm kind of convex or concave ? "
C,Task,"So comm it could be curve comm so it could be convex comm conve concave comm depending on what what we want . "
B,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So there are flats comm there are single curve and there are double curves . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"These are the three things comm "
C,Task,"and there are different materials comm "
C,Task,"with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve . "
C,Task,"So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood comm titanium and all those things comm "
C,Task,"but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"it'll bring the cost down "
C,Minor,"and anyway it's "
B,Task,"Although comm you know comm wood could be uh quite a stylish uh option comm "
B,Task,"if you take like comm nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some comm some varnish on . "
A,Minor,"Mm but i "
A,Task,"but there is no elasticity "
A,Minor,"which could be "
C,Minor,"Wooden cases "
B,Task,"Well it depends comm "
B,Task,"I mean comm you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break "
B,Task,"so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken comm "
A,Task,"Yeah but the components inside . "
B,Task,"it's the inside . "
B,Task,"Yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Very too expensive to do . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And I mean you could also comm you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well . "
A,Minor,"And also uh "
A,Task,"Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood . "
B,Task,"That's true comm "
B,Elicit,"but are we set on the banana idea ? "
D,Task,"Actually "
A,Minor,"Well it look like "
A,Task,"it looks like you are all targeting that "
D,Task,"I was thinking that the "
A,Elicit,"yeah ? "
D,Task,"the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy . "
A,Task,"Yes it is . "
D,Task,"Uh I don't know the name o o in English uh "
C,Elicit,"Is it an e apple which has "
D,Minor,"This "
D,Task,"it's not a fruit it's a vegetable . "
B,Elicit,"It's like a pumpkin or "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? Pumpkin . "
D,Task,"Green . "
B,Other,"Green . "
A,Other,"Green . "
A,Task,"Um um um comm yes I see . "
B,Elicit,"What does it taste like ? "
D,Task,"And you put in the salad . "
A,Elicit,"Pep pepperoni . "
D,Other,"Um "
B,Task,"Ah yeah comm "
B,Minor,"is it "
B,Elicit,"what's it in French ? "
A,Task,"Poivron . "
D,Task,"Oui c'est ca "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm so capsicum or pepper . Yeah . "
A,Other,"Uh pepper . "
D,Other,"Pepper . "
A,Minor,"But um they do d "
D,Task,"And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I don't know comm it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me comm like "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Minor,"I mean in a "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"It's not re it "
B,Minor,"like with a banana you can have "
A,Elicit,"you you think it's really fancy and fun ? "
A,Minor,"You think that young people that are "
D,Task,"I'm sure it's fun . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah . More than a banana ? "
D,Task,"But banana is not so handy comm "
C,Task,"Banana is more handier as compared to this I think comm and to capsicum . "
B,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"I think that's handier . "
B,Task,"But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top "
B,Task,"and just "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"roll it back and forth like that comm "
A,Minor,"It's kind it's kind of it's more uh "
B,Minor,"but with uh "
B,Task,"I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and "
A,Task,"it's really ergonomic comm it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls . "
A,Task,"Okay let's move on . "
D,Task,"Yeah you're right . "
A,Task,"So time is running comm "
A,Task,"let's move on . "
C,Task,"Okay comm so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated comm "
C,Minor,"just "
C,Task,"and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection comm volume control and teletext browsing . "
C,Task,"These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company "
C,Task,"and we we can go ahead with that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we can go to the next slide . "
C,Task,"Then uh there are different kind of chips comm "
C,Task,"one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . "
C,Task,"So we can have regular chip for control . "
C,Task,"Pricing is a factor for us comm that's why we'll go for the regular chip . "
C,Task,"And uh regular chip supports speaker support comm "
C,Task,"so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced . "
B,Elicit,"So is that comm when you say speaker support comm you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of "
C,Task,"It could be a beep kind of thing . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Elicit,"but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way comm or is just the the signal ? "
C,Task,"Yes comm yes comm that's right comm it's it's onto the chip comm "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"most most probably comm not not hundred per cent sure about that . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ? "
C,Task,"That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined . "
C,Task,"It should be whatever will be the case comm the chip is always going to be sitting inside . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but the speaker comm if the speaker is actually on the chip comm then if it's too far away from the the casing comm or if the casing is too thick comm then you may not hear the the speaker . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh comm so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"As "
C,Task,"or as hearing is concerned comm we can have some gap at some place comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"so that "
B,Task,"So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside . "
C,Task,"That's right . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Yeah . "
C,Task,"So these these were the component selection and these things . "
C,Task,"We can go to the next slide . "
C,Task,"And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web comm "
C,Task,"that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control comm "
C,Task,"so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ comm "
C,Task,"because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything comm "
C,Task,"so with this additional little comm we might be having slightly better market for us . "
B,Minor,"Although comm if "
B,Task,"It depends comm if we like comm if we are concentrating on like a fruit design comm then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit comm you know comm like a different fruit for each device . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Of fruits . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Cause that comm you know comm that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type . "
C,Task,"Remotes "
A,Task,"S objects . "
C,Task,"objects comm okay . "
A,Task,"Crazy objects . "
D,Task,"I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits . "
B,Task,"Well comm you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place . "
D,Task,"No but I think just one fruit to control everything . "
B,Other,"Like a power fruit . "
D,Other,"A power fr a power M a Mando comm a Supermando fruit . "
C,Task,"And uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"and we should have it on the remote . "
D,Elicit,"Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control . "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"Okay comm good . "
C,Task,"So you're having a basis station . "
C,Elicit,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Your "
C,Task,"usually your remote sits on that . "
C,Minor,"So you "
C,Task,"and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries . "
C,Minor,"Now let's say "
D,Task,"So you you have to buy two things comm the banana and the basis station . "
A,Minor,"Bu it's it's . "
C,Task,"Basis station is with the thing . "
A,Task,"You s you you thing . "
C,Task,"It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . "
C,Task,"So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries comm they're rechargeable batteries comm so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost . "
C,Task,"So you're having the basis station and there is a button comm "
C,Task,"if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . Uh "
B,Task,"I think that's a pretty handy feature . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station comm even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries comm you know . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm comm "
C,Minor,"mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget . "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Uh this is "
C,Task,"basis station is nothing more comm just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote . "
C,Task,"That's right . "
C,Task,"But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems . "
C,Task,"So component cost is going to be the least . "
C,Task,"Anyway comm we are not using really advanced technology comm "
C,Task,"L_C_D_ has already been ruled out comm A_S_R_ has been ruled out . "
C,Task,"So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"And "
B,Task,"I'm just wondering actually comm 'cause comm you know comm I this whole fruit thing with the banana comm it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche comm like only a few people would really want a banana comm "
B,Task,"but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? "
B,Task,"You know comm rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana comm you could make it kind of silver . "
B,Task,"And um comm you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch . For better want of a better word "
B,Elicit,"you know ? "
A,Elicit,"You think that yellow it's kitsch . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Well comm you know comm I don I don't know how many peop "
A,Task,"If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"No comm I I "
C,Task,"A yeah comm otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then . "
B,Minor,"Well they "
A,Minor,"O otherwise "
D,Task,"Maybe li like that . "
C,Task,"It's neither a banana nor a "
B,Task,"Yeah comm like this colour this colour "
B,Minor,"Maybe comm you know comm "
B,Task,"maybe like still in the shape of a banana . "
A,Task,"Roughly . "
B,Other,"No comm exactly . "
B,Task,"Exactly . "
B,Task,"Um comm but you know comm just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana "
B,Other,"and just kind of comm you know "
B,Task,"because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . "
B,Task,"I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of comm you know comm twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . Let's move on . "
C,Task,"And uh going to the last slide . "
A,Minor,"Uh uh "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Go for it . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Well no comm not not you comm "
A,Task,"you can finish your slides before "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"so . Anyway comm users'll be "
C,Task,"so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes . "
A,Minor,"Mm "
A,Minor,"okay . "
C,Minor,"So that was very "
C,Task,"I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"That's it . "
A,Other,"That's all ? "
C,Task,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so mm "
A,Task,"so well done for the presentations . "
A,Task,"So we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do . "
A,Task,"So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations "
A,Task,"just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"and uh where Superman go banana and uh "
A,Task,"uh extra func functionalities such as wheels comm um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"I do I don't remember you call it ? "
C,Task,"That's right . The basis station . That's right . "
A,Other,"Basis station comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh so um "
A,Task,"so we're going for a stylish banana shape . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"so comm I guess you wanna hold like the way "
B,Task,"the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm right . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"you know comm so if you have like "
D,Task,"What about what about this shape ? More or less . "
A,Minor,"We "
C,Task,"There's less space on this to put with the buttons . "
A,Minor,"I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"but how many buttons do we need ? "
A,Task,"the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . "
A,Task,"If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult "
A,Task,"if you don't have to do it in fact comm it's better . "
C,Minor,"Uh what about a "
A,Task,"So ti time is running comm "
A,Task,"we have to we have to we have to to move forward . "
A,Task,"So let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"So we have this . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"We have a a basis um comm "
A,Elicit,"how do you call it ? "
C,Task,"The base station . "
A,Other,"A base station . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"We'll have a base station extra uh on the side . "
B,Task,"okay comm "
B,Task,"so I guess we need comm you know comm something that can fit a banana shaped object . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh comm we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping . "
C,Task,"That's right comm yeah comm we need that comm yeah . "
A,Task,"We need b R_F_ to beep . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm so it's uh "
A,Task,"So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Basis station . "
A,Other,"Basis station comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Other,"thank you . "
B,Minor,"Alright comm so we need uh "
B,Other,"okay . "
A,Task,"Can you go quickly please ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and your tur turbo turbo uh button . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device comm "
C,Task,"Turbo button . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"on the th yeah comm maybe here . "
B,Minor,"so you have "
A,Task,"And the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so you have the thumb kind of here . "
A,Task,"And and you have two wheels . "
B,Task,"So yeah comm you need one one here and one on on the other side comm so you got volume an and channel . "
A,Minor,"Okay right . "
A,Minor,"Good . "
B,Minor,"And comm uh "
A,Task,"So no L_C_D_ . "
B,Task,"No L_C_D_ . "
A,Task,"Okay great . Um . "
A,Task,"Very good . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Uh for the remote ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Oh comm just the switch comm "
C,Task,"Remotes don't have power on off switch . "
A,Task,"no f not for the T_V_ for the T_V_ . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh so you "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"S no comm that'll be controlled by the "
D,Minor,"What a "
C,Task,"those buttons'll be there already comm yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Where ? "
C,Task,"Means on the remote . "
A,Task,"On the side . "
C,Task,"Because remote is going to have both the interfaces comm scroll as well as buttons . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"They are not going to cost you much comm "
C,Task,"everything is in-house "
C,Task,"and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . "
B,Task,"Well comm I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote "
C,Task,"Oh comm yeah . "
B,Task,"in the first place comm you know . "
C,Task,"That's that's another issue which I didn't think of . "
B,Minor,"Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um "
C,Task,"But you know our targets are very high comm means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make . "
D,Minor,"What about "
B,Elicit,"Yeah comm how many of these did we wanna sell ? "
B,Task,"I can't remember comm "
C,Task,"Twenty five . "
C,Task,"Twelve point five is the profit on one . "
A,Task,"Twenty five . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah comm but how many units did we need to to sell ? "
C,Task,"Uh forty th four . "
D,Task,"Four millions ? "
C,Task,"Point point four million ? "
B,Other,"Four point four million . "
C,Task,"Point four million . "
B,Task,"That's a lot of fruit . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"In the market . "
D,Minor,"What about a "
A,Minor,"So . Well . No . "
A,Task,"Time is running comm "
A,Task,"we have to close the meeting in a few minutes . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So comm okay comm the next step comm "
A,Task,"you can come back to your seat . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"The next step is to go for to f is to go to uh "
A,Task,"to building a prototype comm based on this comm "
A,Elicit,"okay ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things . "
A,Task,"You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design "
A,Task,"and you have to work on the user interface comm "
A,Task,"in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
D,Task,"I wo what about adding the this word spotting comm keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ? "
A,Task,"It's too difficult . "
D,Task,"It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative "
D,Task,"and I don't know if it would cost a lot comm just a few five words . "
A,Task,"It's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype comm "
A,Task,"so t it's in the next prototype "
A,Task,"so let's skip it . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"For the future prototypes . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm maybe comm "
A,Task,"for the n if if if it it works well comm we'll go for uh an orange one . "
B,Minor,"That can be the t "
B,Other,"That can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando . "
A,Other,"Yeah yeah comm honour the fruit . "
D,Other,"Plus plus comm okay . "
D,Other,"Maybe objective banana ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Thanks very much . "
A,Task,"We'll see n next meeting . "
A,Other,"Bye . "
C,Elicit,"So meeting's over ? "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Okay . "
B,Task,"We have to go design the prototype . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Minor,"The problem is after all this meeting there is "
