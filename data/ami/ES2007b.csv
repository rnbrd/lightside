A,Minor,"Think we can first "
C,Task,"Right it was function F_ eight or something . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"This one right there . "
B,Minor,"Tha "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation ? "
C,Task,"Think we all "
C,Other,"Huh . "
B,Elicit,"You will as well ? "
C,Task,"Oh I thought we all were . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I have one too comm okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"S "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Other,"Whoops "
C,Task,"I forgot to put the thing on "
A,Minor,"Right . I just wanna "
A,Task,"'cause basically I can't re I've really crap at remembering everyone's name "
A,Elicit,"so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay I'm "
A,Other,"just gonna leave this up here "
A,Task,"'cause I'll you know . So "
C,Task,"Yeah . Sure comm that's a good idea . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I'm Catherine with a C_ . "
B,Task,"C_A_T_H_ E_R_ I_N_E_ . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"and "
C,Task,"Uh Gabriel . "
A,Other,"Gabriel . "
A,Elicit,"E_L_ is it ? "
C,Task,"E_L_ . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"And you're "
D,Task,"I am Reissa . "
A,Other,"s r R_E_I_S_S_ "
D,Task,"R_E_I_S_S_A_ . "
D,Task,"Double S_ A_ comm "
D,Task,"yeah yeah . "
D,Other,"Sorry . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"'S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think . "
B,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"True . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm right . "
D,Other,"Mm 'kay . "
A,Other,"Okay comm right comm welcome to meeting B_ . "
A,Task,"Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting comm basically comm "
A,Task,"uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . "
A,Task,"I am your Project Manager comm "
A,Task,"and comm uh yeah comm I'm just here to "
A,Task,"sort of liaise between the three of you "
A,Task,"and get things going comm get people talking "
A,Other,"and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . "
A,Minor,"Um right comm this for the purposes of this meeting "
A,Task,"what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you comm "
A,Task,"what you've been working on for the last wee while comm "
A,Task,"when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and comm you know comm filling out silly questionnaires and things . "
A,Task,"But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive . "
A,Minor,"So we're gonna "
A,Task,"each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . Um . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Then we're gonna work comm you know comm from each of your presentations . "
A,Task,"We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . "
A,Task,"Um and then we'll comm yeah comm we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it . "
B,Elicit,"How long is the meeting ? "
A,Task,"This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So I want each of your presentations to not be too long comm five five minutes comm something like that . "
B,Task,"No problem . "
A,Task,"Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy comm it doesn't matter comm "
A,Minor,"it it just it just says that you it's "
A,Task,"that's just one particular medium . "
A,Task,"If you haven't had time to prepare one comm you can draw stuff on the noteboard comm "
A,Task,"you can talk to us comm "
A,Task,"you can you know however you want to do your little presentation comm basically comm you can . "
A,Task,"Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . "
A,Task,"'Cause I don't . "
A,Minor,"Uh okay . So um . "
A,Elicit,"You okay over there ? Reissa comm "
D,Task,"I'm fine . Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here "
D,Task,"I uh yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Think she's finishing up her presentation . "
A,Other,"or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ? "
D,Task,"D I mean comm I I'm finishing off my presentation . "
D,Task,"No no . "
D,Task,"Uh I'm done . Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay comm jolly good . "
A,Minor,"Alright comm let's have um "
A,Task,"well comm we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . "
A,Task,"I think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"So that's gonna be you Catherine comm "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"if we wanna hear from you first . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Um just connecting this . "
B,Minor,"Are we getting i "
A,Task,"You don't have to worry about screwing it in just "
B,Elicit,"Really ? "
B,Task,"Okay . Cool . "
A,Task,"there you go . "
B,Minor,"Okay . So I've got a very quick uh "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So the working design comm I've got a very quick presentation on this comm "
B,Minor,"so um I've "
B,Task,"oh no comm "
B,Task,"you can't see a thing . "
B,Other,"Oh well comm "
B,Other,"I'm gonna draw it on the board then . "
B,Task,"It's in blue uh comm and I couldn't change it . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"We it's fine on my screen comm "
A,Other,"Ah . "
B,Task,"but never mind . "
B,Task,"So um the idea is that we've got the "
B,Task,"energy source um comm "
B,Minor,"which in our case will pr comm "
B,Task,"oh well okay comm never mind . "
B,Task,"So um I think maybe uh two batteries comm "
B,Task,"I dunno what they're called "
B,Task,"six comm or something like that . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Uh and then "
B,Minor,"um "
B,Task,"then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal comm "
B,Task,"which could be uh an infra-red signal comm "
B,Task,"um which will be sent by an electronic chip . "
B,Task,"And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . "
B,Task,"So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . "
B,Task,"Um and that's it really for the working design . "
A,Task,"Great . Okay . "
B,Other,"Sorry "
B,Task,"the presentation wasn't very uh clear but "
A,Task,"I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . "
B,Elicit,"Really ? "
B,Task,"Cool . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Um comm should I erase this or "
A,Task,"Do you wanna just give us a moment comm "
A,Other,"I just wanna copy this down . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ? "
B,Task,"Fine . "
B,Elicit,"Or suggestions ? "
D,Elicit,"Is a battery like the only way of "
B,Task,"Well comm it's just comm you don't want it plugged in really comm s "
C,Other,"Yeah comm alternate energy source comm like win wind power or "
D,Task,"No comm no "
B,Elicit,"In indoors . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm you blow on it and i "
D,Task,"No I meant like "
D,Task,"No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . "
C,Other,"Bicycle power . "
D,Task,"The battery's down and "
D,Task,"maybe comm I dunno comm solar charged ? "
B,Task,"I dunno comm "
B,Task,"swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain comm but "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"it's worked for the last fifty years you know . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"One question I have comm "
C,Task,"and I don't know how much control we have over this is um comm "
C,Elicit,"as far as the infra-red signal comm do we have control over comm you know comm how far away you can be from the receiving unit comm the the T_V_ comm and still have it be operational ? "
C,Task,"I mean comm maybe we want one with a strong signal stream . "
A,Elicit,"How far away is your television ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be comm you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch comm it's not doesn't have to go that far comm "
C,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"Well comm the thing is uh you you don't "
A,Elicit,"does it ? "
A,Task,"Doesn't have to go through a wall comm because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down comm and go into the other room . "
C,Task,"That's true . "
B,Task,"Well comm we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . "
B,Task,"I didn't think about that "
D,Task,"How about Bluetooth ? "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"Instead of using infra-red comm use Bluetooth . "
B,Task,"Why not ? "
D,Elicit,"Isn't that a better signal ? "
B,Task,"I just think that it's it's gonna cost more "
B,Task,"and I'm I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"You know we don't need it . "
B,Task,"It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice comm "
B,Task,"but then I don't th I dunno comm "
B,Task,"either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room comm "
B,Minor,"you are gonna "
A,Task,"Yeah comm exactly . "
A,Task,"Basically comm we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . "
A,Minor,"It's uh "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Oh comm we can we can keep the idea if you i "
B,Task,"We can see at a later stage comm maybe comm I don't "
D,Task,"'S just an idea . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Right comm well done comm Catherine . "
A,Task,"Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Do you need the border ? "
C,Other,"Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Other,"Technical . Okay . "
D,Minor,"Adjusting . "
C,Task,"Okay comm so comm while this is warming up comm "
C,Task,"there it is uh . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So I'm doing the user interface design . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm and basically uh comm as far as methods comm I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes comm trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . "
C,Task,"Thinking of what we can retain comm what we can do away with comm "
C,Task,"uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . "
C,Task,"we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change comm I guess comm "
C,Task,"I mean people want a remote that's familiar comm that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics comm but "
A,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
C,Task,"Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that comm the basic functionality that people want . "
C,Task,"Um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control comm "
C,Task,"um so up-down keys for that comm "
C,Task,"uh channel keys up-down comm "
C,Task,"but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want comm rather than doing up-down comm "
C,Task,"and uh a mute button . "
C,Task,"Uh one thing that I didn't include here comm that I forgot that we talked about last time comm was doing um some sort of lock uh function . "
C,Task,"Uh comm I don't I dunno comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"uh that's one possibility . "
C,Task,"And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes comm "
C,Task,"ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred comm "
C,Task,"which I don't know if I can access the web page from here comm "
C,Other,"but I can show you uh . "
C,Task,"Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one comm "
C,Task,"so you see it's rather busy comm "
C,Task,"but it also lets you play your movie comm stop your movie comm fast-forward comm all this comm um freeze frame . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh and this is a user centred one . "
C,Task,"Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . "
A,Minor,"Great . "
C,Minor,"And I "
C,Task,"judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after comm "
C,Task,"uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . "
C,Task,"So comm the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality comm "
C,Task,"but it can be a little bit overwhelming comm "
C,Task,"so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . "
C,Task,"Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh comm Reissa comm "
C,Task,"because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Task,"So uh comm yeah comm that's me . "
A,Task,"Great . Okay . "
A,Other,"Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . "
A,Task,"This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other comm you know comm existing units stuff . "
A,Elicit,"Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or "
C,Task,"No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . "
C,Task,"I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That was sort of the inspiration for it . "
C,Task,"Um I've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I've comm haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . "
C,Task,"I dunno comm "
C,Elicit,"what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"I would say it's If it's simple to do comm "
A,Task,"which I think it probably should be comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"even if it's a physical comm you know comm a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote comm even something like that comm um then yes comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"it's like comm you know comm like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing comm something like that comm "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"but you know being physical . "
A,Task,"Look into . "
A,Task,"Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well comm something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . "
A,Task,"It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"You know comm the the company it's it's comm from what I can see from our other products comm are yellow with blue writing on them . Um . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . "
A,Task,"We put the fashion in electronics . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I think I think we have to carry that mental . "
A,Other,"There you go . "
A,Task,"So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . "
A,Task,"If if remote control well comm if telephones can be fashionable comm then maybe remote control units can be . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Well yeah "
C,Minor,"these comm I think comm we can "
C,Task,"so we talked about the layout in my presentation "
C,Task,"and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Because we need "
C,Task,"I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here comm I mean . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Great . "
C,Task,"Uh comm everything is going t ergonomic comm you know comm "
C,Task,"there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic "
C,Task,"and keyboards "
C,Task,"and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market comm I guess . Um . "
A,Task,"Okay comm fantastic . "
A,Task,"Right comm well done comm Gabriel . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um Reissa . Let's plug you in comm baby . "
D,Minor,". "
D,Elicit,"Where does it go into ? "
C,Minor,". "
D,Elicit,"Here ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"The blue thing . "
C,Task,"Uh comm yeah comm this is getting all . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,". "
C,Task,"Yeah comm then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up . "
D,Other,"Well comm function F_ eight . "
D,Task,"No "
A,Task,"Yeah comm w it it just takes a wee while . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it just takes a second uh . "
D,Task,"oh . "
D,Other,"Come on . "
D,Minor,"Right . Okay . . Okay . "
D,Task,"Well comm for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab comm "
D,Minor,"and also gave "
D,Task,"so this is research "
D,Task,"and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . "
D,Task,"Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know comm "
D,Task,"so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . "
D,Task,"So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . "
D,Task,"Okay comm so they don't like the look of the remote control . "
D,Task,"Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . "
D,Task,"So I think we all agree with that . "
D,Task,"Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . "
D,Task,"So comm they don't like like the way they operate "
D,Task,"it doesn't like match how people behave . "
D,Task,"Um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote comm "
D,Task,"so probably if you have like one comm two comm three comm four comm five comm the whole up to z ten comm they probably don't use those comm "
D,Task,"they only use the up and down channel . "
A,Task,"'Cause we've only got five channels . "
D,Task,"exactly . "
D,Task,"That's another thing . "
D,Task,"Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . "
D,Task,"Not quite sure what they mean comm zap comm goes like . "
A,Task,"I think that's k flicking quickly between channels . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . "
D,Task,"I think especially for uh the older generation . "
D,Task,"I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones comm "
D,Task,"takes ages to work how to use . "
D,Minor,"Anyway um "
D,Task,"and they also remotes often get lost in the room comm so nobody can find them . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So maybe tracking devices is a good idea . "
D,Task,"Um personal preferences . "
A,Task,"Wow . "
A,Task,"You are a child of technology comm aren't you ? "
D,Minor,"Um so yeah um "
D,Task,"I was thinking something easy to use comm especially for older people . "
D,Task,"Um has to look really cool comm flashy groovy for people to buy it . "
D,Task,"And it's easy to find comm "
D,Minor,"so I don't know whether maybe "
D,Task,"and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating . "
D,Task,"So voice activation . "
D,Task,"So and this was what we came up with . "
D,Task,"Then if you look fifteen to twenty five "
D,Task,"this is age comm sorry comm age groups . "
D,Task,"So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes . "
A,Task,"So there you go comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . "
D,Task,"And neither did the older generation comm "
D,Task,"but the younger generation who we are catering for comm like who have most of the money nowadays comm do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . "
A,Elicit,"Uh but do the younger generation have the money ? "
C,Task,"No I would I would say the older the older people comm yeah . "
A,Task,"They they don't . "
A,Task,"It's older generation comm they're the ones that have gone out and "
D,Task,"Well the twenty five to thirty five year old comm and thirty five comm and the thirty five to forty five comm forty five point seven per cent say no comm so "
A,Task,"People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . "
A,Task,"For people up to the age of thirty five comm you're kinda saying comm yeah comm they want it . "
A,Minor,"Um but no they're not sort of "
A,Task,"most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that would be my guess as well . "
A,Task,"uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years . "
D,Minor,"So they don't "
A,Minor,"Um d and tha "
D,Task,"Well "
A,Task,"and that's a that's quite a minority there comm "
A,Task,"so yeah comm it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent . "
D,Task,"These guys are growing up . "
C,Elicit,"What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? "
C,Task,"I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I mean comm okay comm there's "
D,Task,"Voice activation might not be the best . "
A,Task,"I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"Um also with um with buttons comm a thing called R_S_I_ comm "
D,Task,"so wrist sense "
C,Task,"Repetitive strain uh "
D,Other,"Huh ? "
C,Task,"rep repetitive strain injury "
D,Task,"Yeah comm repetitive strains injury comm "
C,Minor,"or like from doing "
D,Minor,"so they don't "
D,Task,"I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often comm keep changing channel hurts their wrist . "
D,Task,"I don't think so . "
B,Other,"Well maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then . "
A,Minor,"So y so it's so it's so you got "
A,Task,"so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of "
D,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"maybe not so hard . "
A,Minor,"see "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this . "
B,Task,"Maybe it could be comm instead of pressing button it could be just touching a "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Let's jus "
D,Minor,"Maybe "
A,Task,"we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time comm say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"we should probably consult with our legal department uh . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"They're having a lunch break at the moment comm but yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think we can do some really in in that department comm the the ergonomic department comm we can make some some really good improvements . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"or we just like flat buttons comm something . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So that is me . "
A,Task,"That's great comm "
A,Other,"thank you very much for that comm Reissa . "
A,Task,"Um okay comm so we've basically "
A,Minor,"we've decide we've d "
A,Task,"we've decided that it's gonna be comm you know uh comm we're going for a basic television remote . "
A,Task,"It's gotta be safe to use comm "
A,Task,"it's gotta look cool . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"It's gotta be cheap . "
A,Minor,"S um . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Now going back to the uh industrial design of it comm "
A,Task,"you know comm we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . "
A,Task,"I think comm we should just go with the simplest option on everything comm "
A,Task,"uh and that would be infra-red comm "
A,Task,"energy source comm that would be batteries . "
A,Task,"Uh mean we we can look into using the s comm you know comm the little tiny weeny batteries comm all like special long-lasting batteries . Um . "
A,Minor,"But a in there's no "
A,Task,"I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years comm "
A,Task,"because technology will have changed and comm you know comm we won't have televisions in ten years' time . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"I think we're all um pretty sussed on that . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"anyone have any questions ? "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"Everybody happy in their work ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page . "
A,Task,"Now this is good comm "
A,Task,"we've got a good structure going on . "
A,Task,"We all know where we're going to . "
A,Minor,"Have you been ge has "
A,Elicit,"have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ? "
C,Task,"Oh it's probably just you comm 'cause you're the project manager . "
B,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Well comm just questionnaires . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Sell trying to sell your things . "
