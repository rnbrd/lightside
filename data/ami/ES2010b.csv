A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Um welcome to our second meeting . "
A,Task,"This is the functional design meeting . "
A,Task,"And I hope you all had a good individual working time . "
A,Task,"Okay comm let's get started . "
A,Task,"Okay comm here's the agenda for the meeting . "
A,Task,"After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary comm take the meeting minutes . "
A,Task,"And we're gonna have three presentations comm one from each of you . "
A,Task,"Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . "
A,Task,"Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . "
A,Task,"And then we're gonna close up the meeting . "
A,Task,"And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . "
A,Task,"First we need to determine the user requirements "
A,Task,"and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . "
A,Task,"And then we're going to determine the technical functions comm what is the effect of the apparatus comm "
A,Task,"what actually is it supposed to do comm what do people pick up the remote and use it for . "
A,Task,"And then lastly we're going to determine its working design comm how exactly will it perform its functions comm "
A,Task,"that's the whole technical side of "
A,Other,"'Kay I'll just give you a minute comm 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Other,"Oh comm "
A,Task,"well let's go ahead and comm "
A,Other,"back comm previous . "
A,Task,"So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you comm on your research that you just did . "
A,Elicit,"Who would like to start us off ? "
C,Other,"I don't mind going first . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Um do you have a PowerPoint or no ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's in the should be in the m Project . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or "
C,Task,"You know you could you could do it yourself actually . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
B,Elicit,"Did you send it ? "
A,Elicit,"Save it in the project documents . "
C,Task,"Put it in Project Documents comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Mm-mm-mm . "
A,Elicit,"This one ? "
C,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . Great . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Um well comm "
C,Task,"the function of a remote control comm as what uh we've been informed comm is basically to send messages to the television set comm "
C,Task,"for example comm switch it on comm switch it off comm go to this channel comm go to channel nine comm turn the volume up comm etcetera . "
C,Task,"Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include "
C,Task,"it's the numbers comm you know comm zero to nine comm so you can move to a channel comm the power button on slash off comm "
C,Task,"the channel going up and down comm "
C,Task,"volume going up and down comm and then mute comm a mute function . "
C,Task,"And then functions for V_H_S_ comm D_V_D_ comm "
C,Task,"for example comm play comm rewind comm fast-forward comm stop comm pause comm enter . "
C,Task,"And enter would be for like comm you know comm the menus . "
C,Task,"And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ comm "
C,Task,"whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen comm things like that comm all the more complicated functions of menus . "
C,Task,"And we can decide if that's what we want comm comm um if we want to include that on the remote comm if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself comm for example . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"These are two examples . "
C,Task,"Um and you can see on the left comm it's got a lot more buttons comm "
C,Task,"and I don't know if you can read it comm but it says comm step comm go to comm freeze comm um slow comm repeat comm program comm mute comm "
C,Task,"and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . "
C,Task,"And then on the right comm it's a lot more simpler comm "
C,Task,"it's got volume comm it's got the play the like circle set comm which is play comm rewind comm but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . "
C,Task,"So you have functions that are d uh duplicating . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject comm and the power button . "
C,Task,"So that gives you two different kinds comm a more complex and more simple version . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Ready . "
C,Task,"And then lastly comm it's just the questions that we want to consider "
C,Task,"like what functions do we want it to include comm and how simple comm complex it should be ? "
C,Task,"And what functions it needs to complete . "
C,Task,"Uh comm what are needed to complete insulation process comm "
C,Task,"'cause comm you know comm that's something that also has to be considered "
C,Task,"and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing comm when you set it up it should be set to go comm "
C,Task,"but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . "
C,Task,"So that's it . "
A,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Very good presentation . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Task,"You speak with such authority on the matter . "
C,Minor,"Mm . Left . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Who would like to um follow that one up ? "
A,Minor,"Now comm that we've discussed "
D,Other,"I can go . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Do you want me to run it or you wanna "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you should run it . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Functional requirements . "
D,Task,"Mm yes . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements . "
D,Task,"Yes comm "
D,Task,"okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab comm "
D,Task,"and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire comm "
D,Task,"and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . "
D,Task,"Seventy five percent think they're ugly . "
D,Task,"Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more comm which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier comm "
D,Minor,"and basically w we just need something that really "
D,Task,"I mean there's some other points up there comm "
D,Task,"but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . "
D,Task,"So that's really what we need to do . "
C,Other,"Wait . "
D,Task,"And we need we need it to be simple comm yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So "
C,Elicit,"And that meaning what ? "
D,Minor,"Like "
D,Task,"They like I guess use the buttons a lot . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"It's from my uh research . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm what do you m "
D,Other,"My team wasn't very clear . "
C,Other,"Only use ten percent of the buttons . "
A,Other,"Oh comm I'm sorry . "
D,Task,"That's okay . "
A,Elicit,"What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user comm like they have to press the buttons . "
D,Task,"I I think it's like the engineering versus user comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex "
A,Minor,"Oh comm right . "
D,Task,"and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there comm because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . "
A,Minor,"The buttons . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"We only use ten per cent of our brains . "
D,Task,"Good point . "
A,Task,"It works . "
D,Task,"It's a necessary evil . "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Ready for the next slide ? "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"And so people say that they typically lose it comm "
D,Task,"as you yourself know comm because you probably lose your remote control all the time comm "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"much like any small appliance like a cellphone comm "
C,Minor,"Lost . "
D,Minor,"and they "
D,Task,"we need something simple comm "
D,Task,"because most people comm well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one comm "
D,Minor,"and we don't want to go "
D,Task,"we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote comm "
C,Minor,"S "
D,Task,"but I mean they do need to be able to identify it comm "
D,Task,"and R_S_I_ comm I'm not very sure what that is . "
A,Task,"It's okay . "
A,Other,"It's very important . "
D,Other,"Yes comm it is important for the remote control world . "
C,Other,"Wait comm "
C,Task,"is that like your "
C,Task,"ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? "
D,Minor,"Sh "
A,Task,"Could be comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh possibly . "
B,Elicit,"Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? "
C,Minor,"Like "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Uh yeah comm that's what my web site said comm "
D,Minor,"I "
C,Other,"Channel comm volume comm power . "
D,Task,"don't know . "
A,Task,"I think that's a pretty good guess though . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I would assume so . "
D,Task,"I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . "
C,Minor,"It's like if you're holding it "
A,Minor,"Yeah . It's okay . "
D,Task,"But also s so the channel comm the volume and the power buttons are the most important "
D,Task,"on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used comm "
D,Task,"but those are the definitely the top ones . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Next slide ? "
D,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design comm "
D,Task,"but it it really needs to be simple . "
D,Task,"So saying from y your slide comm your presentation comm the engineering versus the user-specified remotes comm "
D,Task,"I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . "
A,Minor,"User-friendly . "
D,Task,"Where the engineering ones comm the boxes comm tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . "
D,Task,"Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . "
D,Task,"And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers comm "
D,Task,"so even though we need a small number of buttons comm we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player comm a TiVo comm what what exactly are we using it for comm "
D,Task,"as well as the age range . "
D,Task,"So we need a hip comm but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . "
D,Task,"And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing "
D,Minor,"they really "
D,Task,"consumers are really interested in it comm "
D,Task,"and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . "
A,Minor,"And so just to "
A,Elicit,"just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say comm channel five comm and the thing would go to channel five ? "
D,Task,"I guess so comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"to just say comm where are you comm and thing beeps comm you know . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I guess we can interpret it like comm we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . "
A,Task,"Oh comm that'd be lovely . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it "
C,Task,"It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . "
A,Task,"Mm . Oh comm yeah comm that's true . "
C,Task,"You know like go to the base . "
A,Task,"We could definitely include that if we wanted to . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"If it's within our price . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Are we ready for our last presentation comm Amber ? "
B,Other,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I'm just trying to move it . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"'Kay . I think it should be there comm working design . "
C,Elicit,"Working design . "
A,Other,"There we go . "
A,Other,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one comm 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . "
A,Other,"Oh my bad . "
D,Task,"Oh that's fine . "
B,Task,"Uh okay comm so method method of our design comm I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . "
C,Other,"Help me . "
B,Task,"We need a power source comm we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . "
B,Task,"Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . "
B,Task,"Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart . "
D,Elicit,"What exactly is a smart chip ? "
B,Task,"Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . "
C,Elicit,"Well comm how much extra would the additional chip be ? "
C,Elicit,"Is that gonna push us over our production costs ? "
B,Task,"I wouldn't think so comm "
B,Task,"'cause we could probably get it from like comm in bulk comm from a a newer company . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Ready ? "
B,Task,"Um yep comm "
B,Task,"nothing here . "
A,Task,"That's okay . "
B,Task,"Um power source comm I figured comm batteries comm "
B,Task,"'cause they're easily available . "
B,Task,"Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s comm sometimes three . "
B,Task,"Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . "
B,Task,"Um a large on-off button comm "
B,Task,"demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people comm "
B,Task,"so a large on-off button would probably be good . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Selection button for various entertainment devices comm so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system . "
B,Task,"Um smart chip that perverts uh that permits comm sorry comm universal application "
B,Task,"again comm something that'll allow us to skip over between devices comm "
B,Task,"and that's kinda it . "
B,Task,"Uh this is my fifty second design . "
B,Task,"Power source over here . "
B,Task,"We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it comm and you're gonna need the switch . "
B,Task,"Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness comm "
B,Task,"um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . "
B,Task,"Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb comm so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . "
D,Elicit,"So what exactly we are looking at comm is this like the front of the remote ? "
B,Task,"This is just like a rough schematic . "
A,Elicit,"So this would be the front ? "
B,Task,"So this is the internal workings . "
A,Elicit,"So the red would be the front of the remote though comm right ? "
D,Minor,"Oh okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ comm "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"but the other bulb comm I think comm is good to just to indicate comm I'm doing something comm it's sort of like a reassurance . "
A,Task,"The l the light up kind of "
D,Task,"Like that we know the battery's working . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so you don't have to stare at that infra-red comm "
B,Task,"'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently comm you have to actually stare at that bulb and go comm okay comm when I push this button comm is it working ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"It'd probably be lighting up the key too comm "
B,Task,"We can skip that whole thing . "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"So you can put it in the dark . "
A,Minor,"The buttons . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm and that's good . "
D,Task,"We should make it glow in the dark . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm definitely . "
A,Elicit,"'Kay nex R Ready ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's it . "
A,Elicit,"'Kay comm any p 'Kay ? "
D,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
A,Elicit,"Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though comm "
A,Task,"you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button comm you think . "
B,Task,"I think that that's a good idea comm "
A,Elicit,"Anything else ? "
B,Task,"because you know that's one of the most important buttons . "
C,Minor,"Just "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Well comm should it be larger buttons in general comm "
C,Task,"you know like uh the examples that I had comm they were swi quite small . "
C,Task,"So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? "
D,Task,"I think we should . "
D,Minor,"Like I think that would be in a as in like in for the design comm "
D,Other,"sorry comm um . "
D,Task,"I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote comm "
D,Task,"'cause most remotes have small square buttons comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles . "
C,Task,"Ovals . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm let's talk about all of our "
A,Task,"We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include comm "
A,Task,"let's um wrap up this one comm "
A,Other,"and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint comm "
A,Task,"'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements "
A,Task,"which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . "
A,Other,"Wait comm come back . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Task,"let's go through this . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Here we go . "
A,Task,"New product requirements . "
A,Task,"First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . "
A,Task,"We're trying not to over-complicate things . "
A,Task,"So no D_V_D_ comm no TiVo comm no stereo . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"It's not gonna be multi-functional . "
A,Minor,"Hey . "
A,Task,"And we th need to promote our company more comm "
A,Task,"so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . "
A,Task,"We're trying to get our name out there in the world . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And you know what teletext is ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"in States we don't have it comm "
A,Task,"but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather comm kind of sports comm "
C,Task,"I know . "
D,Elicit,"What is it ? "
A,Task,"it's very um bland looking comm "
A,Task,"it's just text on the screen comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's like black comm black and white kind of "
A,Minor,"not even "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"just black with just text . "
D,Elicit,"Like running along the bottom ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so "
C,Task,"It'll give you the sports . "
D,Other,"Wait comm "
D,Elicit,"is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? "
A,Task,"Kind of . "
C,Task,"Except the entire screen . "
B,Task,"It's the entire screen is just running information at random . "
A,Task,"Yeah it's the whole screen . "
C,Task,"You can pick sports comm you can pick the news comm you entertainment comm "
A,Minor,"So anyway "
B,Task,"Seemingly . "
C,Minor,"you know it's like "
D,Elicit,"So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But it's becoming out-dated now comm because of the Internet . "
A,Task,"Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news comm "
A,Task,"and we have twenty four hour news channels now too comm so "
A,Task,"Those are our new product requirements . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"So comm do we have to include the company colour within that ? "
A,Minor,"Alright . Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"It's part of the logo . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Company colour being yellow . "
A,Task,"What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions comm definitive that we can all agree on comm about um the target group and the functions "
A,Task,"and just definite things that we need to do "
A,Task,"and then we'll close up the meeting . "
A,Minor,"So . Alright . "
A,Other,"Whatever . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So our target group is "
A,Task,"You mentioned um older people ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Would it just be universal for everyone comm you think ? "
A,Task,"Because I think even if something has large buttons comm as long as they are not childishly large comm like even technically "
C,Task,"It's gonna make it nicer . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . "
A,Task,"I mean they want something user-friendly comm so "
B,Task,"Mm well comm even if we kept the regular standard size of remote comm if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra comm "
B,Task,"'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so we want um for our target group would we say comm I mean comm young and old comm all age ranges comm "
A,Minor,"all um comm "
A,Task,"not kids obviously comm "
A,Elicit,"right ? "
A,Elicit,"Or kids ? "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"kids need to know how to use a remote comm I would think . "
B,Task,"Most of them will intuitively pick it up though . "
D,Task,"They gotta change between Disney Channel comm Cartoon Network . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think we need it all . "
A,Elicit,"Um what about "
A,Elicit,"technic technical um specifications comm "
A,Elicit,"like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? "
D,Task,"Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person . "
C,Task,"We should go for the lowest denominator . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Right comm okay . "
C,Task,"High school educated . "
A,Task,"So so they need no technical experience to operate "
B,Task,"how 'bout little to no comm "
B,Task,"because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And we also need to determine the specific functions of this comm "
A,Task,"just to get it all out on paper . "
A,Task,"So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ comm needs to change the channel comm turn on and off comm just basic simple stuff like this . "
A,Elicit,"So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes . "
C,Task,"Well it's channel comm on-off button comm volume comm mute . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm comm volume . "
D,Task,"And channel . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Those are the most important ones . "
A,Task,"Right . "
A,Minor,"And we wanna keep um "
A,Other,"I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . "
A,Elicit,"Correct comm "
A,Task,"because people only use ten percent . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Elicit,"Hey comm what else ? "
C,Minor,"Um . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Elicit,"Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? "
A,Task,"I think so . "
A,Elicit,"What do you "
D,Task,"Sure comm yeah . "
A,Task,"A finding kind of device or "
B,Minor,"And "
D,Minor,"I need "
D,Task,"we we need a like homing device . "
B,Elicit,"like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach comm how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm ho homing device . "
C,Minor,"Oh right "
C,Minor,"yeah okay . "
A,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Minor,"Tracking . "
D,Task,"Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"What if we gave it a charger ? "
B,Task,"And on the charger comm just like a phone comm like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger comm "
C,Task,"But you got a base . "
B,Task,"and if you d leave your phone somewhere comm you push the button to find it comm and it finds th the phone beeps for you . "
D,Elicit,"Do you think people'll really go for that though ? "
D,Minor,"Because "
B,Task,"It's useful for the remote phone . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Would that add to our costs at all comm I wonder ? "
D,Task,"I would think so comm because you'd have to develop a base . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"Well comm if you have the base comm you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I I think we can make a decision about that later . "
A,Task,"Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . "
A,Task,"So that would include battery source "
A,Task,"Power source rather . "
A,Task,"Is it going to have a charger comm or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? "
A,Elicit,"And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition comm if we want that . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Do w "
C,Minor,"Well comm then we could "
C,Task,"If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Well comm th there's the people who desire speech recognition comm there's the different demog demographics have different desires comm "
D,Minor,"I don't know if you guys ge "
A,Minor,"You could um "
D,Task,"It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black comm "
A,Task,"we could hook it up . "
A,Task,"Oh . "
D,Task,"but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . "
D,Task,"So basically older people don't really care . "
D,Task,"It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . "
D,Task,"I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and "
C,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"And if and if we introduced it when they're this age comm they're going to probably always buy a remote that has "
D,Task,"just sitcoms and stuff . "
D,Task,"Right . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"Well comm then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television comm in the base comm or in the actual remote comm "
C,Task,"'cause then you've already got remote in your hand comm why you just gonna speak to the remote comm "
A,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device comm too . "
A,Task,"If we said comm find remote comm locate remote comm or something . "
D,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"A certain phrase then it could beep . "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Other,"Just throwing it out there . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"Still fifteen minutes . "
C,Minor,"Um . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm anything else we wanna discuss ? "
C,Elicit,"Well comm do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? "
C,Elicit,"Can we conceive of leaving them out ? "
A,Minor,"Um . "
D,Other,"Wait comm "
D,Elicit,"on the remote itself ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm like you have one comm two comm three comm four comm five comm six comm seven comm eight comm nine comm zero . "
D,Task,"Well comm we definitely need those . "
A,Minor,"How how comm "
A,Task,"yeah comm "
A,Elicit,"how would you leave those out ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Well comm I don't know comm "
C,Minor,"I mean comm if you can like well "
C,Task,"I don't know comm "
A,Task,"Unless you could say the channel . "
C,Task,"if there's just a way of leaving them out ? "
B,Task,"I think people would find that too foreign . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
D,Minor,"You definitely need "
A,Task,"And also remember that in this day in age we need comm you know comm like a hundred button comm too . "
A,Task,"I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . "
A,Task,"So I couldn't whenever I got cable comm I had to get a new T_V_ . "
B,Task,"It's when we get satellite . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"get your own remote comm or digital cable . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . Um . "
A,Task,"I guess comm we're gonna discuss the project financing later comm "
A,Task,"making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment comm so "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . "
C,Elicit,"The colour being yellow ? "
D,Other,"Wait . "
A,Task,"I'm guessing . "
C,Minor,"And how do we "
D,Task,"I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish . "
A,Task,"And the R_R_ . "
B,Task,"R_ the double R_ . "
A,Task,"We could just have the logo in yellow comm "
C,Task,"Can't make it entirely "
A,Task,"or maybe a yellow light for the keys . "
B,Minor,"Or is the l "
D,Task,"Or put like stripes comm "
D,Task,"oh yeah comm yellow lights . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"yellow could be and it could "
B,Task,"doesn't have to be huge . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well if you have like a "
C,Other,"Hang on . "
C,Task,"If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it comm just like yellow with the R_R_ . "
A,Task,"Right . "
A,Task,"So we've simplified comm we don't need all those um play comm fast-forward comm rewind comm "
C,Minor,"Right comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"or no menu buttons . "
A,Task,"So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off comm volume comm mute comm channel up and down comm um the numbers "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um can we go back to "
A,Other,"I'm gonna look really quickly back at those "
C,Elicit,"Two examples . "
A,Other,"examples "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"and see if there is anything . "
A,Elicit,"Which one is yours comm technical functions "
C,Minor,"Oh comm it's a "
A,Elicit,"or functional requirement ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm audi audio settings and screen settings comm we need those "
D,Task,"like audio settings mono comm stereo comm pitch comm screen settings like brightness comm colour comm "
D,Elicit,"or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? "
A,Minor,"The T_V_ . "
A,Task,"I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . "
A,Elicit,"I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? "
C,Task,"Well comm the other option is sort of like down at the bottom comm like farther away comm "
C,Task,"you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much comm but occasionally you will use . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . "
C,Minor,"and so it's like "
D,Task,"It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff comm "
D,Task,"and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television "
D,Task,"if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful . "
A,Task,"Couldn't we do that all through one button comm "
A,Task,"something comm a menu button comm that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says comm you know comm audio comm video comm whatever comm language comm "
C,Task,"I don't well comm I don't know . "
A,Elicit,"you know ? "
C,Task,"Right . "
D,Task,"So we need up comm down comm and side-to-side buttons . "
C,Minor,"Well comm that could be "
A,Task,"For the menus . "
C,Task,"No "
C,Task,"you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"That's true . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"Channel is just up and down . "
D,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
C,Task,"And then add a "
A,Task,"Something that looks mayb you know . "
D,Task,"Such as comm yeah comm the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . "
A,Task,"Y right comm right right right . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"That one ? "
C,Task,"So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed comm "
A,Task,"Right . "
C,Task,"including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now "
A,Task,"In the middle perhaps . "
C,Task,"included in the menu . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Other,"Ooh comm "
D,Task,"I just got an idea for a design . "
A,Task,"good . "
A,Elicit,"Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? "
B,Task,"I had something comm but I forgot . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"get out of here . "

A,Task,"And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . "
A,Minor,"Um I'm gonna put the minutes "
A,Task,"I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder comm "
A,Task,"if you'd like to review them . "
A,Task,"And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . "
A,Task,"Um here's what we're each going to do . "
A,Task,"The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept comm "
A,Task,"um U_I_D_ the user interface concept comm "
A,Task,"and you're going to do some trend watching . "
