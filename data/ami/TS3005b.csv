A,Other,"Good morning comm again . "
C,Other,"One question . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Choose a number ? "
C,Other,"Send . "
C,Other,"Submit . "
D,Other,"Yep yep yep yep . "
A,Elicit,"All set ? "
C,Task,"Mm . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Good . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Let's see what we can find here . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"A very warm welcome again to everyone . "
A,Task,"Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . "
A,Task,"Um and this is what we are going to do . "
A,Task,"The opening comm which we are doing now comm um and the special note comm "
A,Task,"I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary comm "
A,Other,"which means I will make uh minutes "
A,Task,"as I did of the previous meeting . "
A,Task,"And uh I also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder comm "
A,Task,"so you can see them "
A,Task,"and review what we have discussed . "
A,Task,"Um if I'm right comm there are three presentations comm "
A,Elicit,"I guess each one of you has prepared one ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Good . "
A,Task,"And um we will also take a look at new project requirements comm um if you haven't heard about them yet . "
A,Task,"And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions "
A,Task,"and we have some more time comm forty minutes . "
A,Task,"But I think we will need it . "
A,Elicit,"Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation . "
C,Other,"I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well . "
A,Task,"You can go first comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Other,"shall I go first with the users ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"I think "
D,Minor,"well "
D,Task,"okay no problem . "
A,Elicit,"Is there an order ? "
B,Task,"everybody already has his presentation comm "
A,Minor,"I haven't "
D,Other,"Ja precies comm ja precies comm ja precies "
B,Task,"so you can adjust it . "
C,Minor,"So . "
C,Other,"Huh ? "
C,Minor,"Okay comm um "
A,Other,"And one question comm "
A,Elicit,"uh your name Denni comm is it with a "
D,Task,"E_I_E_ . "
A,Other,"I_E_ E_I_E_ comm okay . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm um "
C,Other,"I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . "
C,Task,"It's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . Um "
C,Minor,"well so "
C,Task,"it basically works uh as I uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . "
C,Task,"Uh when you press a button comm uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume comm um a little connection is made "
C,Task,"uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a "
A,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Task,"on a little print plate "
C,Task,"uh which uh makes uh uh a connection "
C,Task,"that uh "
C,Task,"gives the chips comm "
C,Task,"uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . "
C,Task,"Uh senses that a connection has been made comm "
C,Minor,"and know "
C,Task,"and knows what button you pressed comm becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . "
C,Task,"Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal "
C,Task,"which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors "
C,Minor,"which makes "
C,Task,"uh which sends the signal to a little let . "
C,Elicit,"You know what a let is ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal "
C,Task,"which is sent to the television set . "
C,Task,"Uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red . "
C,Task,"That's basically uh how it works . "
C,Task,"Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls comm are that uh they are very easy to produce comm "
C,Minor,"uh it is pis "
C,Task,"uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production "
C,Task,"because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page comm "
C,Task,"uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh and chips . "
C,Task,"Uh and the technology's already available comm "
C,Task,"we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work "
C,Task,"or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals . "
C,Task,"Uh I made a little uh uh animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works . "
B,Other,"Oh right . "
D,Other,"Animation . "
C,Minor,"we tel "
B,Task,"There is something turning . "
C,Other,"There . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"it's a little bug "
A,Other,"it's in the in the smart board . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Uh well "
C,Task,"the sub-component comm I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is comm is f in this example it's the button . "
C,Task,"Uh when it is pressed down comm um comm the switch is ter is uh is switched on comm "
C,Task,"so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course comm "
C,Task,"because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh "
C,Task,"li uh a d ad uh electronic uh "
D,Task,"Infrared light . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
C,Minor,"uh comm okay . Um "
C,Minor,"w "
C,Task,"after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb comm "
C,Task,"and from there it signals a Morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"S "
C,Task,"Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . "
C,Task,"Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held comm "
C,Task,"so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something comm "
C,Task,"or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it . "
C,Task,"Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours comm and uh easy to use buttons . "
C,Other,"But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I've got it there too . "
C,Other,"And it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry comm easy to use buttons . "
C,Task,"Perhaps soft touch comm uh touch screen uh buttons "
C,Task,"because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged comm "
C,Task,"uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . "
C,Task,"And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm well comm "
C,Task,"that's my contribution to this meeting comm "
C,Minor,"and uh "
D,Minor,"To this meeting . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"two of these this meeting . So . "
A,Other,"thank you . "
B,Other,"Shall I go uh next ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Other,"Please . "
B,Minor,"So . "
D,Other,"Smoking . "
B,Minor,"Well uh comm "
B,Task,"my name's comm "
B,Task,"and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . "
B,Task,"Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls comm of how they uh they look comm and information from the web that I found . "
B,Task,"Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set comm "
B,Minor,"how you uh d "
B,Task,"what you described uh just early . "
B,Task,"And this can be all sorts of medsa messages comm "
B,Task,"turn it on comm "
B,Task,"turn it off comm "
B,Task,"uh change the channel comm "
B,Task,"adjust volume comm that kind of thing . "
B,Task,"Uh play video comm teletext comm "
B,Task,"but also t uh play C_D_ "
B,Task,"if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . "
B,Task,"There are some uh examples of remote controls . "
B,Task,"You can see they are very different . "
B,Task,"The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . "
B,Task,"And the other is uh more user friendly comm little with big buttons . "
B,Task,"And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it comm "
B,Task,"but uh the the essential stuff is there . "
B,Task,"Um I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach comm "
B,Task,"because the customers have to use them "
B,Minor,"and "
B,Task,"and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . "
B,Task,"A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm well "
B,Minor,"perf "
B,Task,"personal preferences is is uh a simple remote comm with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . "
B,Task,"But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier comm "
B,Elicit,"split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? "
B,Task,"Because all the T_V_s will have them . "
B,Elicit,"Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . "
B,Task,"And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . "
B,Task,"If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video comm it could also work with uh with the stereo comm "
B,Task,"because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . "
B,Minor,"The shu c "
B,Task,"you could reuse the buttons "
B,Task,"so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . "
B,Task,"And it should be a user friendly comm clear buttons comm and not too much . "
B,Task,"And that is my presentation . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"thank you . "
D,Other,"'Kay . Check . "
B,Task,"You must still have it open . "
D,Minor,"Kijke "
D,Minor,"'Kay comm so . "
D,Task,"We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote comm "
D,Minor,"that m "
D,Task,"that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control comm "
D,Minor,"or just "
D,Other,"Yeah comm and the users comm actually . "
D,Task,"The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . "
D,Elicit,"Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? "
D,Task,"And then tho that section we're going to focus "
D,Task,"and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Some data . "
D,Task,"Younger people comm from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens comm speech recognition e etcetera . "
D,Task,"And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . "
D,Task,"The elderly people comm from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features comm "
D,Task,"and we possess less than two third comm that's two fifth comm of the market share in that area . "
D,Minor,"Goed so . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"Findings . "
D,Task,"Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . "
D,Task,"So we don't have to make it very small comm like uh like a mobile phone or something comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"but some somewhat bi bigger than small comm "
D,Task,"so you don't lose it that much anymore . "
D,Task,"Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot comm "
D,Task,"so the buttons sh should be that small comm "
D,Task,"or shouldn't be that complex "
D,Task,"because we have to search for the buttons comm which one are you going to use . "
D,Task,"Next . "
D,Task,"Important issues about the remote . "
D,Task,"I think it would be better with a personal reference comm but okay . "
D,Task,"Remote control has to have to have a low power usage comm "
D,Task,"because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour comm "
D,Task,"so the power usage is also one one time an hour comm or so comm "
D,Task,"with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . "
D,Task,"The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control comm "
D,Task,"so those they those have to h be find very easily . "
D,Task,"And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . "
D,Task,"It has also be have to find easily when the label is gone . "
D,Task,"My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"or would be s uh "
D,Minor,"senden "
D,Minor,"okay . So uh "
D,Task,"if that's k uh if that's the problem comm you also have to find it easily "
D,Task,"on the remote . "
D,Task,"Buttons . Like what all colleagues said comm have to have to be minimalized . "
D,Task,"or should be covered comm "
D,Task,"or in L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Task,"L_C_D_ screen is easy "
D,Task,"because we have the L_C_D_ screen comm we have the various options . "
D,Task,"Put one option "
D,Task,"and then you have the all the buttons of that options comm "
D,Task,"so the other options would be gone . "
D,Task,"And you don't see the buttons . "
D,Task,"So L_C_D_ screens should be easy comm "
D,Task,"but an L_C_D_ screen comm the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . "
D,Task,"So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen comm you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . "
C,Elicit,"Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm touch screen comm yeah . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"The last but not least comm younger people are more critical about the features . "
D,Task,"Because they use the remote control often more often comm "
D,Task,"and are more technical than the ol older people . "
D,Task,"And the older people spend more money comm and easily on a remote control . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people comm "
D,Task,"but also somewhat on the elderly people . "
D,Task,"And on my personal preferences comm I don't have any mo more time to come with that comm "
D,Task,"but like I said comm L_C_D_ screen is easily to use "
D,Task,"because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . "
D,Task,"And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons comm the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . "
D,Task,"And that is it . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
B,Other,"Oh right . "
A,Other,"thank you . "
A,Minor,"Um comm well "
A,Other,"thank you all comm huh . "
A,Elicit,"I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? "
B,Task,"No . Res I did not . "
A,Other,"No ? "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Elicit,"Perhaps the rest ? "
A,Task,"then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them "
D,Minor,"Ja comm "
A,Task,"so you can "
A,Task,"all read them . "
A,Other,"Oh comm well not in this presentation . Hmm "
A,Other,"Should be in there . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Other,"I can tell you them uh from my laptop . "
A,Task,"Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . "
B,Minor,"Oh . Mm . "
A,Task,"So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . "
A,Task,"Uh the remote control should only be used for the television comm "
A,Task,"otherwise the project becomes more complex comm "
A,Task,"which endangers the time to market comm "
A,Task,"and of course would make it more costly comm I think . "
A,Task,"Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus comm "
A,Task,"and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty comm "
A,Task,"and you talked about that before . "
A,Task,"And uh a last point comm but also very important comm our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products comm "
A,Task,"which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . "
A,Task,"So we have to keep that in mind . "
A,Minor,"Um well uh "
A,Task,"according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Elicit,"who has any idea about what should be on it comm and what shouldn't ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Other,"you said it should only uh work with one appliance ? "
D,Minor,"Be "
D,Task,"television . "
B,Other,"Or with one uh d che only the T_V_ ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . Only be used for television . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"And the video also comm or not uh ? "
D,Task,"Only the television . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"it says only for television here comm huh . "
B,Other,"Oh . Alright . Okay . "
A,Task,"Makes it a lot easier comm "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"yeah comm then you can yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Requirements comm "
D,Other,"no ? "
D,Elicit,"Functions . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Then it should have uh on comm off comm "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"for "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Standby options comm "
B,Minor,"and uh "
D,Task,"the basics then by a volume comm channel comm one till two zero numbers on it comm "
C,Elicit,"yeah ? "
C,Minor,"Uh yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"And per perhaps uh "
D,Elicit,"oh teletext doesn't have to be ? "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Elicit,"Um other functions . "
B,Minor,"Well uh uh "
B,Minor,"yes yes s sh "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers . "
D,Minor,"I had "
C,Minor,"Two s two "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"two digits comm "
C,Task,"oh okay . "
B,Minor,"Can you "
B,Elicit,"Don't know if that's got a name comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Other,"I understand what you mean . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I think it's "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that comm "
D,Task,"because some T_V_s comm if you press the t one and then the two comm it be between five secs it make twelve comm "
C,Task,"It makes it twelve comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and that's that's not relaxed "
C,Task,"Indeed . Okay . "
B,Minor,"S "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Other,"not really "
D,Task,"to user . "
C,Minor,"And "
C,Task,"and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function . "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"d uh wh "
C,Task,"the Philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj to reach channel twelve . "
D,Task,"So that it easy and fast . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"so you should have that one on . "
C,Task,"Uh yeah comm think so . "
D,Elicit,"Our main targets' age are ? were ? Forty five plus comm or ? "
B,Task,"Mute misschien also . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Uh well "
A,Task,"new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty comm "
A,Task,"and now we have current customers uh of forty plus . "
D,Other,"Forties comm okay "
D,Minor,"because because younger people as "
D,Task,"Uh younger people have now comm sixteen till to twenty five age comm are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Task,"From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent comm "
D,Task,"and thirty six to forty five comm fifty five percent comm "
D,Minor,"so I think to um "
D,Task,"Because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much comm two years . "
D,Task,"You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"With the L_C_D_ screen it's easier "
D,Task,"because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"we "
C,Task,"we could yeah . "
D,Task,"and then you can use it again . "
C,Task,"But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . "
C,Task,"Because L_C_D_ screens are very expensive . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"but a you don't know "
C,Task,"A touch screen uh probably uh even more . "
B,Minor,"An "
C,Minor,"So comm "
D,Task,"True . "
C,Other,"true comm true . "
C,Minor,"But uh "
C,Minor,"Well um "
C,Elicit,"is it possible to make an L_C_D_ screen uh comm "
C,Elicit,"how was the information ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"it only says that this perce percentage like L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Task,"Because comm yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical . "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"And if the only f "
C,Task,"perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"because our target is sixteen to forty five . "
B,Minor,"But comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Elicit,"but uh will we not uh exceed our uh our uh production uh "
B,Minor,"do you "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"you don't know how much it costs . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"you don't know how much it costs comm the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Elicit,"Is it possible to find out comm anyway ? "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"I don't have any costs here comm "
C,Elicit,"You know ? "
D,Task,"I only have percentages . "
B,Elicit,"But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? "
B,Elicit,"Or because if it only directs at the T_V_ comm then you only have uh I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"No comm "
C,Task,"an L_C_D_ screen's just like uh like a drawn here . "
C,Task,"Um just uh displays several buttons comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons comm such as channel and volume comm you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen "
B,Other,"Oh right comm "
C,Task,"and it's possible to p uh press them down comm just like a touch screen . "
B,Minor,"so you can "
B,Other,"Oh comm yeah alright . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"if you want to adjust comm like for example comm adjust the audio settings comm you press audio on the touchscreen "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we can make it possible to do that comm yeah . "
D,Task,"and you get the buttons for audio settings comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
B,Other,"Yeah alright comm oh right . "
D,Task,"so the other buttons are gone . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think it's the most easier thing comm "
B,Minor,"Would be yeah . "
C,Minor,"That's my uh "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Other,"And hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive . "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Elicit,"we had twelve fifty comm I guess comm for uh production ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Twelve fifty . "
C,Other,"Um . "
B,Elicit,"Any guesses ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"I suppose wi if the mar if our um if the i "
C,Task,"if the young people are interested in L_C_D_ screens comm we should make 'em . "
D,Task,"Highly . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"And if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people comm "
B,Task,"but also on the older comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ? "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Um comm "
D,Minor,"s "
D,Task,"forty six to forty five comm thirty three percent comm "
D,Task,"and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . "
D,Task,"But our our our what's it comm project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets comm to customers that are younger than forty . "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
B,Minor,"so still a little bit people "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah that's right . "
B,Task,"But you don't want to alienate the other uh "
D,Task,"No comm that not now comm "
D,Minor,"but comm so "
B,Task,"But if they also buy it then it's alright . I guess . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Yeah . Alright . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
B,Minor,"An "
A,Elicit,"L_C_D_ it is ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Mm . It's treasure . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And what else ? "
C,Minor,"I hope we uh h and "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Other,"let's hope to reach those uh those sales . "
D,Minor,"i i if it "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"if it costs gets too much comm too expensive comm then yeah comm we should be sticking to rubber buttons . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"can you um uh s "
C,Task,"I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens . "
D,Minor,"N "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"nothing comm no costs at all . "
C,Minor,"Uh so if you uh "
B,Task,"But perhaps later comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm so "
B,Minor,"so uh "
C,Task,"if you uh you receive an email about that comm uh can you post it in the "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder . "
D,Minor,"in "
D,Minor,"I think that should "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"yeah "
D,Task,"I think we all get the costs of everything . "
B,Minor,"I don't "
C,Task,"Because you are the the Marketing uh Expert . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm I'll I'll post it . "
C,Minor,"I uh "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"perhaps we should have a backup plan "
B,Task,"that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive . "
C,Task,"Yeah sure comm sure . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay comm L_C_D_ comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly . "
B,Elicit,"The L_C_D_ ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Oh that's a bit of a problem . "
D,Task,"and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy . "
B,Task,"Oh comm that's a bit of a problem . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Tha i l i "
D,Task,"it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's looks fancy one yeah comm of L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but they don't they don't like it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"just a the plain remotes comm not not specific L_C_D_ remotes . "
B,Other,"Oh comm alright comm "
B,Task,"I thought that you said that . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L_C_D_ remote comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"because it's new comm as far as I know . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
C,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
D,Task,"And then you have the other thing comm that seventy five percent zap a lot comm "
C,Minor,"And then not yeah . "
D,Task,"but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Minor,"Um . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time comm to get all the fingerprints off it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"what else does our remote need ? "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"A mute button . "
A,Other,"Mute button . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I think . "
D,Task,"The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection comm volume con selection comm "
B,Minor,"And "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and power s power usage . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And a teletext comm but that is not of the question . "
B,Minor,"But "
D,Minor,"Other things are "
B,Elicit,"But shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ? "
D,Other,"Sorry ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it could be . "
B,Task,"Remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm teletext . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And there's also a "
D,Task,"And other other less important things are screen settings comm audio settings comm and channel settings comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"they are less important comm "
B,Task,"but I think they should be there comm "
D,Task,"Less important . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"or not ? "
D,Task,"should be there comm "
D,Minor,"but not press "
C,Minor,"A sh "
C,Task,"but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm sub-menu comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh I think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English comm uh comm to not use batteries comm "
C,Minor,"and use ac uh bat uh batteries to uh to be "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Like with a with a mouse comm you have not comm yeah . "
C,Task,"yeah yeah sure . Indeed . "
C,Task,"So uh you can mount uh the the the uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"in a breath it's "
C,Task,"uh the remote control to um "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Charted . "
B,Task,"We should think of the twelve fifty we have "
C,Task,"to refill the "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but we don't we don't have any costs now comm "
B,Minor,"I don't know how much that's going to uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Okay comm "
D,Minor,"so Yeah . "
C,Task,"because i uh when you get an L_C_D_ screen comm you run it on batteries comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"the batteries will be uh empty very soon comm very fast . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"e e "
D,Task,"power supply is one of the most important things . "
B,Minor,"You should "
B,Task,"Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"You shouldn't on and off "
B,Task,"because that's ver extra comm that you have t first you have to turn the remote on comm "
B,Minor,"and then you can uh "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I think it's it's not that easy "
D,Task,"because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it comm "
B,Minor,"Nee that's that's "
D,Task,"so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down comm the remote shuts down . "
B,Minor,"uh yeah . "
B,Minor,"But then you can't "
C,Task,"And go to standby mode when you don't use it comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"so that "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah "
B,Minor,"au "
B,Elicit,"automac matically comm "
B,Minor,"that it yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm automatically . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"After two minutes or three minutes comm something like that . "
D,Task,"After two minutes comm "
D,Task,"yeah two three minutes comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Sure . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"And then b that uh "
D,Task,"before an hour when its get again gets empty . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Then you have plenty of time to recharge it comm "
D,Task,"of put it in a recharger . Charger . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"So we are going for the for the recharger . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"if it's . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"If it's sensible . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"because when you're watching T_V_ comm you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"and I don't think it "
B,Minor,"b when the batteries are low "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"when you "
C,Task,"when you're done with s uh w uh watching your television comm you have to put it "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"okay comm "
D,Task,"but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours comm six hours comm five comm six hours comm then . "
C,Task,"Yeah sure comm of course . "
B,Task,"But you'll also forget to put it in comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"then you have a problem . "
B,Task,"because you throw it on the couch "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"and you don't remember . "
C,Task,"But you also forget to buy batteries comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . That's right . "
C,Task,"and then you can you can't use it comm "
C,Minor,"so I "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"because you have b "
B,Elicit,"or not ? "
D,Task,"but you have L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Minor,"'Cause "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's right comm "
D,Task,"High power usage . "
B,Minor,"but "
C,Minor,"High power user cell comm i "
C,Task,"uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television comm "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Task,"that's also a a a great advantage "
C,Task,"because you can't lose it anymore . "
C,Task,"Because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions . "
D,Task,"True . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"True . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"you made a point there . "
B,Task,"But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"also . "
B,Task,"because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"otherwise all your yeah . "
D,Task,"Just a small device . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"it hasn't "
D,Task,"Plug it in comm that's it . "
B,Minor,"I think everything has it for and I guess . "
C,Task,"It doesn't have to be big . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"like a like telephone charger or something . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"just "
C,Task,"just a cable comm or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"just u "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
D,Task,"It has to be easy to use also comm or things . Uh market share comm speaker re speech recognition . "
A,Minor,"I've "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"you have some more "
A,Task,"points . "
D,Task,"I think . "
C,Task,"Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen comm "
C,Task,"so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points "
D,Task,"Also . "
C,Minor,"uh comm or "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"I think that this should be standard . Large button large buttons . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen comm "
C,Task,"but the elderly only look at two buttons . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And you said something about speech recognition ? "
D,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"it says also "
C,Other,"Speech recognition ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Hello . "
C,Minor,"Twelve Euro "
C,Task,"twelve Euro fifty . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Twelve . That's an "
B,Task,"twelve fifty comm twelve fifty . "
D,Task,"also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five comm twenty six to thirty five years comm seventy six percent comm and thirty six to forty five comm thirty five percent . "
B,Task,"So it's pretty big . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"spread it by a big market . "
D,Minor,"But then I I I "
A,Task,"Even bigger than for L_C_D_ . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"W "
B,Other,"I know let's do a speech . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Other,"let's leave out all the remote controls "
C,Other,"and just put a microphone on top of the television to "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Ninety . Twenty five . "
B,Task,"You can clap or something . "
C,Minor,"Yeah Yeah . "
D,Minor,"channel . "
C,Other,"Turn volume up . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hey comm "
C,Minor,"that "
C,Task,"that's an idea . "
B,Task,"Now you shouldn't say the wrong thing comm I dunno . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm well "
C,Minor,"that should "
C,Task,"it has to be remote control comm "
C,Minor,"not "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"twelve . "
B,Elicit,"But they want to talk into the remo remote control comm or something comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Sure why not why not "
B,Minor,"or ? "
D,Minor,"Is this only would you "
D,Task,"would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . It's the only thing it says . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm mm . "
B,Other,"Oh comm "
B,Elicit,"but do we want to implement that comm "
B,Minor,"or ? "
D,Task,"I think an L_C_D_ screen should be suf sufficient . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But when you look at the percentages "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"it says a lot comm "
D,Minor,"but "
C,Minor,"Perhaps the options should be uh "
A,Task,"Speech recognition scores even higher comm huh ? "
C,Elicit,"Why not ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm well comm "
C,Elicit,"Why not ? "
A,Task,"maybe because of the cost comm "
A,Task,"but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Let's hope uh to have some uh d "
B,Minor,"I know "
D,Minor,"No "
D,Task,"I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen comm "
D,Task,"because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five comm we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands comm "
D,Task,"and fifty five of those people want L_C_D_ screen "
D,Task,"and thirty five want speech recognition . "
D,Task,"So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"But would it be useful to imple implement both ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm if the costs al allow it . "
A,Elicit,"On one remote ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"Or "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I dunno . "
B,Task,"I don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty . "
D,Minor,"Nee . "
B,Minor,"With that uh "
D,Minor,"If it should be done comm "
D,Task,"if it could be done comm I won't matter . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"We should do it . Yeah . Sure . "
B,Elicit,"but how would you like to implement that comm "
B,Elicit,"that you say volume up comm and then it goes up comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"or ? "
B,Other,"Uh . "
C,Task,"Certain systems already exist comm I think . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . "
B,Task,"Then uh it's y it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English "
D,Task,"True . "
C,Task,"True comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . True . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Task,"This should be uh accommodated with some software comm "
C,Minor,"uh comm uh . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Because then I think in Chinese is different written comm volume is different written than um Swahili or something . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Swahili . Swahili . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"you can use icons "
B,Minor,"for the "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Ja comm well possible . "
B,Minor,"a speaker and uh "
C,Task,"Indeed . "
B,Task,"But if that's better than language for the for the remote . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah yeah yeah "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay . "
B,Minor,"Then it's Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"'Kay comm "
D,Elicit,"what else ? "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Elicit,"no speech recognition ? "
A,Minor,"Or "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"if it could be done comm we "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"we have to keep Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Y "
C,Task,"it should be done . If it could be done comm should be done . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and then we have different languages . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"that should be uh anything matters . "
C,Task,"That's not so difficult at all comm "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"because I already use on several voice operated systems comm "
A,Task,"just make a separate remote for each uh "
C,Minor,"and they are all possible to uh not all comm but "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"you sh you should to adjust the thing . "
D,Task,"I think it's difficult . "
D,Minor,"Every language of dialects "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think it's very differen difficult . "
B,Task,"And you have to speak the "
B,Task,"so that it can understand . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think it can't be implemented comm "
D,Minor,"but maybe "
B,Task,"You could use that n as an option comm if you have money left comm or something . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm 's an option comm yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm sure comm indeed . "
D,Other,"Fifty Euro cents . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Let's do speech . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"For speech recognition . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"so we only do this when we have enough money left . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Well "
A,Task,"I've written down an an on or off button comm volume selection comm channel selection comm uh the digits from one to zero comm huh . Um or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits comm mute button comm a separate menu for teletext comm a battery indicator . "
A,Task,"Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_ "
A,Task,"and if there's enough money comm speech recognition . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons "
D,Minor,"Mm comm yes . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"I "
A,Task,"in general . "
B,Task,"With uh teletext if it wasn't ver very important comm "
D,Minor,"No comm "
B,Minor,"it was but "
D,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"You also now have colours . "
B,Elicit,"I don't know if we should implement that . "
D,Other,"Curved ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"when you press the red button comm you go to page one hundred two comm "
B,Minor,"and when you press the "
C,Other,"Uh yeah . "
B,Elicit,"I don't know if we should implement that comm "
D,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"because it says that teletext not really important comm "
C,Minor,"S "
C,Task,"Shortcuts . Uh . "
B,Other,"but yeah comm the shortcut comm "
D,Minor,"I think we should we could that "
B,Task,"and you can't go to sport . "
D,Task,"we could also implement a audio settings comm screen settings and channel settings comm but as sub-menus . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"D "
D,Task,"Mainly if you turn the uh remote control on comm you have to u you have to see from one till zero comm channel and volume . "
D,Task,"And if you want to use teletext screen or audio comm then you can press it . "
C,Minor,"Sh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"It should be available "
C,Minor,"just "
C,Task,"just sub-menu . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"but not "
B,Task,"'Cause it should be there . "
C,Other,"Not directly uh available . "
D,Minor,"not Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"so not too much teletext support comm but in a separate menu comm "
A,Minor,"and "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"So actually it is there but it's just not r ready there . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"but s "
C,Task,"Directly available . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"So does it confuse uh the user ? "
B,Task,"You'll have to search for it . "
D,Task,"They'd have to be easy to use . "
C,Minor,"Uh . I'll search um . "
C,Task,"If you want to use teletext comm you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"that's a "
D,Other,"The sign of it . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"but no more buttons or functions comm "
A,Minor,"or ? "
D,Minor,"Uh comm "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"I guess not . "
D,Task,"no . "
D,Elicit,"What else can you do with a television ? "
B,Minor,"We've got anon "
A,Elicit,"Aren't we forgetting something very important ? "
B,Task,"Have got got two examples here comm "
B,Task,"but I don't think there's anything we're missing . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"play comm pause comm doesn't n need to be there . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"we don't have the video orders "
D,Task,"Yes comm "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"this is your presentation . "
D,Task,"We could check the other remote controls with technical functions . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"you could look here "
B,Minor,"all the the "
D,Elicit,"Which ones were yours ? "
B,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"th th th th "
B,Task,"I don't know comm "
B,Task,"technical functions . "
D,Minor,"Techni "
B,Other,"They're a bit small comm you can we should stretch them comm "
B,Minor,"because "
A,Other,"Ping . "
D,Other,"Ja ja ja ja ja . Technical functions . Yeah okay . "
B,Task,"I guess we've got them all . "
D,Other,"Uh I think I go to have volume comm mute but I Yeah . Very slow . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"the zoom buttons . "
B,Elicit,"And for a T_V_ ? Can you zoom in a T_V_ ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"b "
D,Task,"wide screen comm high screen comm different things you have comm "
B,Task,"Or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and "
D,Task,"yeah "
D,Minor,"different uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"yeah . "
B,Task,"But that should also be a sub then comm a sub uh menu thing . "
C,Task,"Menu . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"it should be available comm but then in separate screen settings or something . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Other,"so we should also implement se screen settings . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"screen settings comm audio settings comm teletext settings you have . "
B,Other,"Oh right . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Channel settings . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"so you can program the "
D,Task,"So those four comm and of course the main . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Other,"so the first you see the main comm "
B,Minor,"and the other ones you can uh go to uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Like tap screens or something "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"or comm I dunno . "
B,Task,"I hope we can do this . "
D,Minor,"Something "
C,Task,"There are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"if uh "
C,Task,"'Cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the uh the screen settings "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Minor,"you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't "
C,Minor,"uh for uh "
D,Task,"then you don't use it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"and if the television does not support such uh operations "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"We don't have to use that top . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So you leave it alone . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote comm an expanded version . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"And do we want them in different colours comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"or "
B,Minor,"And "
D,Other,"Colours . Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"and the buttons comm should they have colours ? "
C,Task,"Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Minor,"Oh "
B,Task,"but we don't have any buttons . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I Because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"then defines itself . "
D,Elicit,"Because uh how many percent ? "
D,Elicit,"Eighty percent ? "
B,Task,"They think it's ugly comm "
D,Task,"Would spend more money if it looks fancy . "
B,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"so use uh very uh lot of peo "
B,Task,"Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts comm like with the telephones . "
C,Task,"Adjust with phones comm yes "
B,Minor,"You can uh But I don't think that uh "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Twelve Euro fifty . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Other,"make it available in different colours comm you mean ? "
C,Task,"Sure . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Red comm white comm blue comm black . "
D,Other,"Rasta colours . "
A,Other,"And a see-through uh "
C,Task,"Grey . "
C,Other,"Yeah sea view comm yes comm Simpson's versions and "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"see through version . Yeah . "
D,Other,"If you press a button comm it turns green . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
C,Other,"Leave . "
B,Other,"A disco version . "
A,Task,"that's the "
B,Elicit,"Five minutes ? "
A,Task,"signal for las final five minutes . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Task,"I have uh the things I just read . "
A,Task,"Um then we have uh separate menus for teletext comm screen settings comm audio settings comm "
A,Elicit,"and what else ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Channel settings ? "
B,Task,"Oh yeah comm right . "
A,Other,"Channel settings . "
B,Task,"So you can program the T_V_ . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile . "
B,Task,"So comm options comm and then you sub them . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Could be possible . "
B,Task,"Otherwise you have all those teletext comm perhaps teletext not comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Or like uh you have a menu button comm you press "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"we said teletext also a separate menu . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"or otherwise you have a menu button comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but I "
D,Task,"press menu "
D,Task,"then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"but we can work that out later comm I guess . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm no problem . Yep . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we're having a a general menu with the most used functions comm uh teletext comm screen settings comm audio settings comm channel settings comm "
A,Task,"and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? Like uh large icons or small icons "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"and "
D,Minor,"Um comm "
A,Task,"I don't know what else comm "
C,Minor,"No . "
A,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"I think b "
D,Task,"because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen comm "
D,Minor,"I think the buttons "
B,Elicit,"Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"but but or like you have "
B,Elicit,"Which one ? "
D,Task,"you only have channel button or volume button . "
D,Minor,"Those buttons you can you can "
B,Task,"But that's also in the L_C_D_ comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but on the L_C_D_ comm "
A,Other,"huh ? "
B,Other,"right ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Right comm yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"So we don't have any normal buttons "
D,Minor,"th "
D,Task,"No comm no normal buttons comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"that uh "
B,Other,"No comm alright . "
D,Task,"Maybe only the on and o on and off button . "
B,Minor,"Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno "
A,Minor,"But we don't need a special "
C,Minor,"Uh not button "
D,Minor,"But I don't think "
A,Task,"we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself . "
D,Minor,"Mm comm "
B,Task,"No comm no . "
D,Task,"no . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Oh well comm "
B,Task,"you should be able to set which T_V_ you have . "
B,Minor,"If you have if you have uh "
C,Task,"Yeah sure comm of course you need uh a settings button comm uh or a settings option for the remote control . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said comm uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ comm "
D,Task,"No no no comm "
B,Minor,"that you don't have to use a "
D,Task,"because we we discussed that you could charge it comm "
D,Task,"otherwise is it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"but not for the remote but for the T_V_ comm "
B,Minor,"that you use "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but a T_V_ of course comm th that's the I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . "
B,Task,"But a not as normal button comm in the L_C_D_ comm "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Other,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ comm "
A,Task,"because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . "
A,Elicit,"So how do you turn the thing on ? "
A,Task,"There has to be a on button on the remote comm "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"you just tap I think . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you tap . "
C,Task,"Just tap it . "
A,Elicit,"huh ? "
D,Task,"Touch screen comm "
A,Other,"Tap the thing . Okay . "
D,Minor,"yeah "
D,Task,"then it's turn turn off comm turn on . "
A,Elicit,"And then the television is on also comm "
A,Elicit,"or just the remote ? "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"just the remote . "
D,Task,"A television don't have to be on comm "
B,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"that one you can press on comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it should be in standby mode comm "
D,Task,"yeah stand-by comm "
C,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"then press on remote comm "
D,Task,"press on "
D,Task,"and then T_V_ should be available . Or not . "
B,Minor,"Yeah a yeah . "
B,Elicit,"I don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button comm a r just uh rubber uh for for T_V_ comm "
D,Task,"Separate . "
B,Task,"so you can turn it on "
B,Task,"and then you can choose the channel . "
B,Minor,"Otherwise you I don't know whether or not that's "
C,Minor,"A A "
C,Elicit,"A normal button on the remote control comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"or norm ? "
B,Task,"To turn it on . "
B,Minor,"Of "
B,Elicit,"or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode comm it should pop on . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"I have comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
C,Minor,"Wh uh "
C,Elicit,"why would it be a a need to have a normal button ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen comm you first have to search where is the on button comm "
B,Minor,"then you uh you you "
B,Task,"then turn it comm "
B,Task,"and then the T_V_ goes on . "
B,Task,"But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote comm then you do the on comm "
B,Task,"and then you search the channel which you want . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but I think the re the remote control comm if you press tap the screen comm it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button comm channel button comm and of course of also the on and off button . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Other,"Oh right . "
C,Task,"I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think so too . "
B,Minor,"Otherwise y wet e k Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
A,Task,"that's might be a unique selling point comm huh for a remote . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"If we can afford it . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
D,Task,"Yeah comm if we can afford it . Yeah . "
A,Task,"I guess we have to "
A,Task,"postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting comm "
C,Other,"Oh comm okay "
A,Task,"because we're running out of time . "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"for now comm we're having a lunch break comm "
C,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work . "
A,Other,"I will uh write uh minutes comm if I can create them out of this . "
A,Other,"And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles . "
A,Task,"And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach . "
B,Other,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Luckily as we are . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well "
A,Other,"thank you very much comm for now comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"and uh have a nice lunch comm huh ? "
B,Minor,"Lunch . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Food . "
B,Elicit,"Should we put this back in our rooms comm "
B,Minor,"or uh ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm think so . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
