A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Je croix que c'est dommage de le "
A,Other,"it will be sad to destroy this prototype . "
A,Task,"It really looks like a banana . "
C,Other,"It is a banana . "
A,Other,"It is a banana . "
C,Other,"It is the essence of bananas . "
C,Other,"I would be confused with this thing . "
A,Other,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"S "
D,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"How is everyone ? "
A,Other,"Hi . "
B,Other,"Hi . "
A,Task,"So we are here for the detailed design meeting . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"we will uh "
A,Task,"I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . "
A,Minor,"Then uh I've "
A,Task,"I will also take notes during this meeting "
A,Task,"and I will send you uh a summary then as usual . "
A,Task,"We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues "
A,Other,"that make good work . "
A,Task,"And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . "
A,Task,"Then we will uh evaluate the product . "
A,Task,"And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"d "
A,Task,"let's start with the cost aspect "
A,Minor,"so so "
A,Task,"I look at the aspect discussed last time comm "
A,Task,"that is to say uh to have a standard battery comm "
A,Task,"to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it "
A,Minor,"to be "
A,Task,"uh to feel spongy comm "
C,Task,"Like a banana . "
A,Task,"and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"which is uh good comm "
A,Task,"because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"for the financial aspect it's okay comm "
A,Task,"we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if comm "
A,Task,"and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
D,Minor,"So uh "
D,Task,"you can have my project in "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"You have a presentation ? "
D,Task,"Uh yeah "
D,Minor,"just a "
A,Other,"Participant four comm yes . "
D,Task,"Four . "
D,Task,"Evaluation . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So you can go . "
D,Task,"We can go through . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"I made an evaluation "
D,Task,"and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . "
D,Task,"So you can go through "
D,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"okay so uh "
D,Task,"we have uh six points . "
D,Minor,"We "
D,Task,"we talked about before . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"we we want to have a product fancy look and feel comm technologically innovative comm easy to use comm fashion comm easy to find in a room comm and robust comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"uh and uh uh "
D,Task,"I have a scale of uh seven points . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . So "
D,Other,"I go through all the uh all the points here comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point comm two point or seven point . "
D,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And after we ha we have an an average comm and uh we see . "
B,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"The "
D,Elicit,"okay ? "
D,Minor,"Uh so uh "
D,Elicit,"fancy look and feel comm what do you think ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Maybe you can presen "
D,Minor,"F "
D,Task,"between o one and seven . "
A,Minor,"okay . "
A,Task,"Maybe hold it . "
A,Task,"So I think it's uh very uh very nice . "
C,Task,"I give it a I give it a five . "
A,Elicit,"What do you think ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . So "
A,Elicit,"it's between one and seven ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Seven is the highest uh ? "
D,Task,"Seven is the "
A,Task,"I will give a six . "
B,Task,"I will give a a five . "
D,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"And you ? "
D,Other,"sorry . "
C,Elicit,"Do you vote uh Christine ? "
D,Other,"eh ? "
C,Elicit,"Do you also vote ? "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"I just want to see something "
A,Task,"Maybe we all have to agree on a common "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Minor,"we can very easily . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Uh I think uh and need to as well . "
A,Other,"No problem . "
D,Minor,"Need to "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"uh I don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or "
A,Minor,"this is your "
A,Task,"One is most . "
C,Minor,"I "
D,Other,"Uh-uh . "
D,Other,"Um . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"we can choose what we want . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Minor,"Or maybe we can say s "
A,Task,"let's say that seven is the best . "
D,Task,"seven is the best mm . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So so "
A,Task,"do note the grade we have five comm six for me comm "
B,Task,"Five . "
A,Other,"five . "
A,Elicit,"And what what's your choice ? "
D,Other,"Oh sorry . "
D,Minor,"Six "
A,Elicit,"How much would you give on the fancy aspect comm on the fashionable aspect ? "
D,Minor,"Uh s you can "
D,Other,"how much what ? "
A,Minor,"How much would you "
A,Elicit,"you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ? "
D,Other,"Oh "
D,Other,"yes "
D,Task,"I mm I dunno mm comm "
D,Elicit,"I think six comm it's a good uh "
C,Task,"So it will have five point five average . "
A,Task,"Five point five average . "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Wa can . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Minor,"does it "
D,Minor,"I "
D,Other,"sorry . "
D,Minor,"Okay . So "
D,Elicit,"after comm the technological aspect ? "
A,Other,"Okay comm techne technological aspect . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we have the wheel . "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"We also have the rubber material comm "
A,Task,"which make it uh like new also . "
A,Task,"I think I would give a five . "
C,Task,"It's four . "
A,Other,"Four ? "
B,Task,"A four also comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"because comm except for the wheel comm we don't have so much innovation . "
B,Minor,"The rubber is "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"D "
C,Minor,"are we including the voice are you glu "
B,Minor,"Uh a four . I I "
C,Elicit,"are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Other,"No . Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"what's your uh grade ? "

A,Task,"Oh yeah comm "
A,Task,"its its f its fruit fruit shape . "
D,Elicit,"Seven ? "
A,Task,"I would say seven . "
A,Task,"And is very very nice design . "
D,Task,"Yeah it's fashion comm "
D,Task,"because it's a fruit comm "
D,Minor,"and we say that the "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"we can we can put a seven here . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm seven . "
D,Task,"yeah comm seven . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Seven comm okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Well comm "
C,Other,"we hope . "
B,Elicit,"Easy to find . "
D,Elicit,"Uh easy to find in a room ? "
B,Other,"I lost my banana . "
A,Task,"I think you can't miss it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Uh . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I think it's cool . "
C,Task,"I think we can put a six here . "
D,Task,"We have the lightning comm "
D,Minor,"or "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"The lighting . "
A,Minor,"we have the "
A,Task,"we don't sesh especially have the lightning "
C,Elicit,"So you'll make the material transparent "
A,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"so that it uh lights up completely comm "
C,Minor,"or "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"it's yellow . "
A,Task,"It's okay . "
A,Task,"I think it's very easy to "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Seven ? "
A,Task,"I would say seven . "
A,Task,"It's hard to miss it . "
B,Task,"Six . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Is it is it robust ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"it's rubber comm made of rubber comm "
B,Task,"Uh f yeah comm "
B,Task,"it's ru it's rubber . "
A,Task,"I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"the only problem there might be which know comm i if it's very sensitive comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"they will comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I don't know "
A,Task,"But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So maybe we can put a six . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Six or five . Five "
D,Elicit,"Everybody is okay comm six . "
A,Task,"Six is okay ? "
C,Task,"Six comm yeah comm for me . "
B,Task,"Six . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"S "
D,Minor,"now um so . "
A,Other,"Tadada . "
A,Task,"We have to sum up everything . "
C,Task,"Twenty . "
D,Task,"Thirteen uh comm twenty comm twenty six point five comm uh seven comm thirty two comm thirty six . "
C,Task,"Thirty . Thir "
D,Elicit,"That's that's okay ? "
D,Task,"Six . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Six is a good "
D,Other,"Good . "
D,Task,"Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm the top "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"the be . "
D,Task,"and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product comm I think . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"six is a "
C,Other,"So will become eight soon ? "
A,Task,"So it's a good evaluation comm I think . "
A,Task,"It's very promising . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm well "
C,Task,"it's a bit biased . "
D,Task,"We have a good price "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
D,Minor,"and uh . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Good . "
A,Task,"So this prototype is quite nice . "
C,Task,"Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped comm uh wireless phones not mobile ones comm wireless for the house comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"uh quite big also comm "
C,Task,"and they were selling something like a hundred Euros comm two hundred Euros . "
C,Task,"Just a just a phone comm wireless . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive comm I think . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I think the "
B,Task,"But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"it's much more complex comm "
C,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"I think comm we can summarise . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we have seen the prototype . "
A,Task,"It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . "
A,Task,"The the the financial aspect were okay . "
A,Task,"We we have the cost below uh our threshold "
A,Task,"and so we could sell at twenty five Euros "
A,Task,"and make i make profit . "
A,Task,"The the evaluation give satisfying result as well . "
A,Task,"So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"the cost is in the budget comm "
A,Task,"the evaluation is okay comm "
A,Task,"so I th I think we can now uh open champagne "
A,Task,"and make a huge party . "
B,Other,"Start to eat banana . "
A,Task,"I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay so "
A,Other,"congratulation . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Congratulations to the team . "
A,Other,"Nice product . "
C,Task,"Uh very well comm we worked together fantastically . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it was a good collaboration uh . "
A,Task,"Aspect . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"what does the management say ? "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
C,Elicit,"What does the management say ? "
A,Task,"I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well . "
C,Other,"Ah . "
A,Other,"All it depends on who watch this meeting . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We don't know . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
