B,Elicit,"Okay we all all set ? "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting . "
B,Task,"Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design comm the user interface design comm and we're gonna evaluate the product . "
B,Task,"And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control comm "
B,Task,"like absolute final decision comm "
B,Task,"um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Other,"just from from last time to recap comm "
B,Task,"we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display comm no need for talk-back comm "
B,Task,"it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons comm "
B,Task,"maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing comm "
B,Task,"um hopefully a jog-dial comm "
B,Task,"and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . "
B,Elicit,"Anything I've missed ? "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Okay "
B,Minor,"um so uh "
B,Task,"if you want to present your prototype go ahead . "
D,Other,"Uh-oh . "
D,Task,"This is it ? "
A,Other,"Ninja Homer comm made in Japan . "
D,Task,"Um comm there are a few changes we've made . "
D,Task,"Um comm well look at the expense sheet comm and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside comm "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"so instead we've um "
D,Task,"this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen comm um just a a very very basic one comm "
D,Task,"very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm "
D,Task,"um button . "
C,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
D,Task,"Uh comm apart from that comm it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time . "
A,Task,"And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? "
A,Task,"the advanced functions are still hidden from you comm but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use . "
C,Elicit,"Where are they ? "
A,Task,"Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ? "
C,Other,"Ah comm right . "
A,Minor,"Okay 'cause "
C,Task,"Great . "
B,Elicit,"So w what kind of thing uh is gonna be "
A,Task,"The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing . "
A,Task,"If you're using an advanced function right comm like um c brightness comm contrast comm whatever comm it will just say "
C,Minor,"Right . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"You know it's like "
A,Task,"it only has four columns comm it's a very simple L_C_D_ like comm "
C,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Right comm 'kay . "
B,Task,"Okay cool . "
A,Task,"It might even be one comm a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the comm you know comm the the symbols of the various functions . "
C,Minor,"Okay "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
B,Task,"Oh right okay . "
C,Elicit,"and what is this here ? "
B,Task,"Cool . "
A,Task,"That's a number pad . "
C,Minor,"Okay so the number pad is "
B,Elicit,"Where are we gonna have the slogan ? "
C,Task,"'Kay comm great . "
A,Task,"Um they're al along this "
D,Minor,"You know comm "
D,Task,"just like right inside there . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay cool . "
A,Task,"You have this space here comm "
A,Task,"and then you have this thing on the side as well comm or at the bottom . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"'Cause slogans are usually quite small comm right comm "
A,Task,"they're not like huge "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"so they're s "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Say a button's about "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Looks good . "
A,Task,"say a button's about this size comm right comm "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan comm say even for that . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"So if this isn't to scale comm what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ? "
D,Task,"Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yep "
A,Task,"so that would be about a centimetre for a button comm "
A,Task,"so one two three four centimetres . "
A,Task,"Plus maybe half o five "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"About nine in total . "
A,Task,"six seven eight comm "
B,Other,"Six comm seven comm eight comm nine comm ten . "
A,Task,"about yeah nine total . "
B,Task,"So we're talking about ten centimetres . "
C,Task,"That sounds good . Yeah . "
B,Task,"That would be good . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"So ten centimetres in height . "
A,Task,"Nine comm ten . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Okay um . "
C,Task,"That'd be good comm "
C,Task,"in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually comm "
C,Minor,"so that would be "
C,Task,"that sounds like a really good size comm if you see it there . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's great "
B,Task,"and it's very bright as well . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"So um okay . "
C,Minor,"Is it possible "
C,Other,"uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . "
C,Elicit,"Is these are these the colours that of production comm or is this just what we had available ? "
D,Minor,"Well I'm "
D,Task,"We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . "
C,Task,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"Okay so just "
B,Task,"could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report . "
D,Minor,"But um "
D,Task,"this button um comm because it's red it's sort of very prominent comm we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button "
D,Task,"if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen "
A,Other,"Excuse me . "
A,Minor,"Sure . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"and you use this as a jog-dial . "
B,Task,"Okay "
B,Other,"so that's like an okay button comm right . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"Oh we've discussed how h high it is comm but how wide is it ? "
D,Minor,"I don't know . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"How high is it ? "
A,Task,"No as in the height comm but what about the width ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Didn't put five centimetres . "
B,Other,"Oh oh "
B,Other,"like depth of the actual thing . "
A,Elicit,"Do we need five ? "
A,Minor,"I don't think five is "
D,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"be about th three and a half . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Something by there . "
B,Task,"Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Sure . "
B,Task,"So you can power on and off comm "
C,Other,"Three and a half . "
B,Elicit,"what else can you do ? "
D,Task,"Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Um comm were gonna have the volume control here comm "
D,Task,"but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume . "
B,Other,"Okay jog-dial for volume . "
B,Elicit,"And what else do you do with the jog-dial ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast comm colour and "
B,Other,"Contrast comm "
B,Elicit,"brightness comm "
D,Task,"Um yeah . "
B,Task,"yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"and anything else ? "
D,Task,"Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions comm "
D,Task,"um we didn't actually go through and specify the "
B,Elicit,"Well of the designers what are they ? "
D,Elicit,"Uh what can a T_V_ do ? "
A,Task,"Okay things like um brightness comm contrast comm "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Task,"um maybe tuning the channels . "
B,Other,"Okay channel tuning . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Task,"That's a good one . "
A,Other,"What else ? "
A,Task,"Um the various inputs . "
A,Task,"Are you having a V_C_R_ comm are you having you know which input do you have ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
C,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Okay "
B,Other,"auxiliary inputs . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
C,Task,"probably colour or sharpness . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Yep comm "
A,Task,"colour comm sharpness . "
B,Other,"Sharpness . "
A,Task,"Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Okay what about uh sound settings "
B,Elicit,"? Uh d can you change any of those at all ? "
C,Task,"Audio . "
A,Task,"Audio comm we have like your basic y your base comm your mid-range comm your high range . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
D,Task,"the the balance hmm . "
A,Task,"Yep comm "
A,Task,"left-right balance comm "
A,Task,"um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes comm "
A,Task,"like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"is there anything else at all it can do ? "
B,Minor,"That "
B,Task,"'cause that's that's fine . "
B,Task,"Just need to know so I can write it down . "
B,Minor,"Okay um right "
B,Task,"I g I guess that's it comm "
B,Minor,"so we can now um "
B,Task,"We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing comm "
B,Task,"and see if we need to "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"um if we need to rethink anything at all . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Elicit,"for this first part here power-wise comm have we got battery ? "
A,Task,"The battery . "
B,Elicit,"Do we have kinetic as well ? "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Other,"No . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Other,"just battery . "
A,Minor,"We need an "
B,Elicit,"And that's because of cost restraints is it ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay "
B,Elicit,"um what about the electronics here ? "
A,Task,"Yeah advanced chip . "
A,Task,"We need an advanced chip I think comm yep . "
B,Other,"Advanced chip . "
A,Other,"Let me just confirm that . "
A,Task,"Yes I think so . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Okay um "
B,Elicit,"the case comm what does it mean by single and double comm do you know ? "
D,Task,"Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"So we want double-curved ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
A,Task,"Plastic . "
B,Elicit,"Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any "
A,Task,"I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Elicit,"um and we wanted special colours didn't we ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Other,"So I'll have to put that "
B,Other,"Oh no wait we "
B,Elicit,"ho how many colours have we got there ? "
A,Task,"For the case itself comm one colour . It's one special colour . "
B,Task,"Just one colour comm okay . "
A,Task,"'Cause the case unit itself comm the rest of our components go on top of it . "
B,Task,"Okay "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"so interface-wise comm is it this third option we have comm the two of them there ? "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"One and the L_C_ display . "
B,Task,"Okay "
B,Elicit,"and then buttons comm we have what comm two colours ? "
A,Minor,"How many "
D,Task,"Um we have um got some push buttons as well . "
C,Task,"Or even clear . "
A,Task,"We've got push buttons as well . "
B,Minor,"Like uh oh wait "
D,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Other,"so push button and integrated scroll wheel push "
B,Task,"okay . "
D,Task,"So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"I'm not sure if that counts but "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay um "
A,Task,"and maybe a special colour for the buttons comm so maybe four again . "
B,Other,"Four . "
D,Minor,"You can see we're we're all very far beyond the "
B,Elicit,"So w why are we arriving at the number four ? "
B,Elicit,"Where does the number four come from ? "
A,Task,"'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons . "
B,Task,"Okay right comm "
B,Task,"so we're writing down four . "
A,Task,"So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"How about these ? "
B,Elicit,"Are we wanting them in "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Other,"no "
B,Minor,"they're just "
B,Elicit,"is everything gonna be plastic ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So we're w w quite far over . "
B,Minor,"Now we're gonna "
B,Task,"something's gonna have to go . "
B,Task,"Um we're at sixteen point eight and "
C,Minor,"Uh how mm-hmm "
C,Elicit,"how are we going to achieve this high-end product if "
B,Task,"Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro comm "
C,Minor,"We only have very sparse "
B,Minor,"so "
B,Other,"let me see comm "
B,Minor,"what are we "
C,Elicit,"Two point three ? "
B,Minor,"I mean "
C,Task,"Four point three "
C,Elicit,"no ? "
B,Task,"oh yes "
B,Other,"sorry comm "
B,Task,"four point three . "
B,Task,"My maths is all out . "
D,Task,"Well we could take out ones by making it single curved comm just fill in those bits . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And then where is the "
A,Elicit,"How much would that save us ? "
B,Elicit,"How much would that save us ? "
A,Task,"That will only save you one . "
D,Task,"That is one . "
B,Task,"One . "
A,Task,"The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together comm "
A,Task,"um because when you "
A,Task,"do something on the T_V_ comm the T_V_ responds and reacts as well comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing "
D,Minor,"That's fair enough comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"so we may not need to "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay so "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"which I think is a technically doable thing so "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"So w what's our reviewed suggestion ? "
B,Elicit,"Um take away the L_C_ display ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"And the advanced chip goes away as well . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"To be replaced with a "
A,Task,"Regular chip . "
B,Other,"regular chip . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So what that means is that um "
B,Task,"And so we've got point three to get rid of . "
B,Minor,"Um and we ha "
B,Elicit,"where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ? "
A,Task,"The twelve buttons that you see there . "
B,Other,"Twelve buttons . "
D,Task,"That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Functionally you're gonna have to intercept "
A,Task,"So four is a good estimate for "
B,Elicit,"Do you think ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"so you can't actually cut "
A,Task,"It's like three times the number of buttons comm four comm eight comm twelve . "
B,Elicit,"Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons comm "
B,Elicit,"how can it be something in between ? "
A,Task,"It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone comm underneath there's actually one button underneath comm it's just that the panel itself is a single panel . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Okay "
B,Task,"well we have point three to get rid of somewhere . "
A,Task,"We just report that it has to be over budget comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"or the colours comm you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . "
B,Task,"No can do . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"we could just go with um "
D,Task,"Yeah w "
A,Task,"Normal coloured buttons . "
B,Elicit,"Well do you want colour differentiation here ? "
A,Task,"No that's not the button we're talking about . "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"Oh yeah sorry yeah then . "
A,Minor,"That's "
A,Task,"the buttons only refer to the pad so "
B,Task,"Right "
B,Minor,"so "
A,Other,"Should we take that off uh ? "
B,Other,"Ah . "
A,Task,"Hey it's back to the original . "
B,Other,"That's it . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"so that might be some some way of cutting the cost . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"ach that's a shame . "
B,Minor,"Um right comm "
B,Elicit,"so take away that completely ? "
B,Task,"Ah . "
B,Task,"And now we're under budget . "
B,Task,"So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted . "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"So I reckon "
C,Elicit,"How about with embossing the logo comm isn't that going to cost us some money ? "
B,Task,"Doesn't say so . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's a freebie . "
D,Task,"Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah that's a good idea . "
B,Elicit,"Just one ? "
B,Elicit,"Does that mean that one button has a special form or "
D,Task,"I think there's just one button so "
B,Task,"Yeah okay . "
D,Task,"handy . "
B,Other,"Well well there we go . "
B,Other,"So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now . "
B,Task,"So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore comm "
B,Task,"and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing comm "
B,Task,"which I think is fair enough comm "
B,Task,"and so this is gonna be one big thing here . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
C,Elicit,"Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ? "
A,Elicit,"What do you mean by profile ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Sort of flat as possible . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"You see I envision it as being um quite deep "
D,Task,"sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"that's what I was thinking comm to "
C,Task,"Sure comm okay . "
A,Task,"We didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_ . "
C,Task,"Yeah alright yeah fair enough . "
C,Task,"Okay comm just thought I'd ask . "
A,Task,"So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and you might want to add in the report comm "
A,Task,"length comm width comm and height . "
B,Task,"Right okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So just to well to be thorough then comm "
B,Elicit,"width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay "
B,Elicit,"and then so height-wise "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Elicit,"How how tall do you envisage it being ? "
B,Elicit,"About that big ? "
D,Task,"Yeah it works comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Two . "
B,Task,"About two centimetres comm okay . "
C,Task,"Two's not very high at all though . "
C,Task,"Maybe a bit higher ? "
A,Task,"This is about this is about two . "
A,Task,"Slightly more than two comm so "
D,Task,"See comm about that thick . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Maybe closer to three even or two and a half . "
B,Minor,"Ach comm that is "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay we'll s we'll say two point five . "
B,Minor,"Okay um "
B,Task,"so we have it within cost anyway . "
B,Minor,"Um so yeah "
B,Task,"project evaluation is this point . "
B,Minor,"Um . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Right uh . "
B,Task,"Okay so can we close that ? "
B,Task,"This is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Someone is gonna have to "
B,Task,"yeah that's fine that's fine . "
C,Minor,"Um it's probably just "
C,Task,"I dunno if it's worth getting into comm "
C,Task,"but um just in in that we want this to be stylish comm should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid comm "
C,Task,"because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid comm and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that "
A,Task,"I think that's something that's very hard to catch comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something . "
C,Minor,"Sure comm okay . "
A,Task,"The the look and the colour is something which is cool comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm alright . "
A,Task,"but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar "
C,Minor,"Okay comm sure . "
A,Minor,"then um because when you put it on the shelf "
C,Elicit,"What about button shape ? "
C,Elicit,"Square buttons ? "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"button shape might be a good idea to change comm rather than rather than positioning comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'cause I think positioning is we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of "
C,Minor,"Sure . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"pad . "
B,Minor,"Right um . "
B,Task,"So at this point we uh comm "
B,Other,"let me see comm "
B,Task,"discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points comm "
B,Task,"with the room for creativity in the project comm and leadership and teamwork comm "
B,Task,"and the stuff we had around us I guess . "
C,Minor,"Mm 'kay . "
B,Minor,"Um comm "
B,Other,"let me see uh "
C,Minor,"Do you want me to d um "
C,Elicit,"Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last ? "
A,Task,"Maybe we should do the design evaluation first . "
B,Task,"Yeah I wasn't really sure what that was "
C,Minor,"Or "
B,Task,"Yeah "
C,Elicit,"Evaluation . "
B,Task,"comm yeah go for that first . "
B,Task,"I wasn't entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"but y you go for it . "
C,Minor,"Sure . "
C,Task,"Um comm alright so the way this works comm I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"I'll try and do it as quick as possible . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Um comm this is um "
C,Other,"I'll just go over your head "
C,Elicit,"if that's okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I don't think you need the power comm "
A,Minor,"so "
C,Other,"What's that ? "
A,Task,"No comm that's okay that's okay . "
C,Elicit,"I don't need the PowerPoint ? "
A,Task,"No comm the power cord itself . "
C,Task,"Oh course comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"yeah that's true . "
A,Task,"so then you have a bit more freedom to "
C,Other,"Let me get that . "
C,Other,"A bit more . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"You you still have your blue fingers . "
C,Minor,"so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a "
D,Elicit,"Is it ? "
A,Other,"You killed a monster . "
C,Minor,"The idea is that I've set up "
C,Task,"I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning comm "
C,Task,"and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan comm "
C,Task,"and uh so we can review that . "
C,Task,"Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary "
C,Task,"because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but "
C,Elicit,"Doesn't seem like it's going comm does it ? "
B,Task,"Oh there it is . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay great . "
C,Other,"Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board comm "
C,Task,"so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um sort of review where we stand with it . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so um "
C,Task,"So to sort of b bring together two things comm sort of design goals and also the market research that we had comm "
C,Task,"uh when we rate this comm one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low comm "
C,Elicit,"okay . "
B,Other,"Mm 'kay . "
C,Minor,"So these i these i th are the "
C,Task,"and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this comm "
C,Task,"so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so "
C,Task,"we just come to an agreement . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Okay ? "
C,Task,"So the first one uh comm stylish look and feel . "
A,Task,"I rate that pretty highly . "
B,Task,"Well yeah comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I dunno like a six or something . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
B,Elicit,"What does anybody else think ? "
C,Task,"um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I'm seeing five then . "
C,Elicit,"What do you guys think ? "
B,Task,"I would say five or six . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"David ? "
A,Task,"Yep I'm fine with that . "
C,Task,"Okay let's go with five then . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Fi oh uh just actually the opposite . "
A,Elicit,"It's one to seven comm right ? "
C,Minor,"The "
B,Task,"Oh yes "
B,Other,"sorry then "
C,Task,"So it meant three comm "
B,Task,"comm then I would say two or three . "
C,Task,"okay . "
A,Other,"Wait comm "
A,Elicit,"what's the scale comm one to seven comm right ? "
D,Elicit,"One's high-ish isn't it ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm one is high . "
D,Other,"Ah comm okay "
D,Task,"so yeah comm two or three . "
C,Task,"'Kay "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"it's upside-down . "
C,Task,"Let's go with two point five then . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm um "
C,Minor,"control "
C,Elicit,"high tech innovation . "
B,Task,"Well it has the wee jog-dial "
C,Minor,"We had to remove "
B,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"but jog-dial "
C,Task,"'s good . "
B,Task,"I'd go with three or four comm "
A,Task,"Say it's more "
D,Task,"Eight "
D,Task,"three . "
A,Task,"medium comm "
B,Task,"maybe three . "
A,Task,"but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing . "
C,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"Yeah about three comm okay . "
C,Elicit,"three ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm um "
C,Elicit,"Style reflects a fruit inspired colour comm design . "
C,Task,"I shouldn't have said colour comm but just "
A,Task,"Lemon . "
B,Minor,"Well that's kind of "
A,Task,"Okay comm the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Sorta . "
A,Task,"except for the b the the red button comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"they because for want of a "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But the yellow comm I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour comm "
C,Task,"Right . Yeah comm could be . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"the the yellow is more representative of the colour comm "
B,Elicit,"couldn't it ? "
A,Task,"but the button itself comm the blue can be anything else . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay "
C,Task,"so we'll go two . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Elicit,"and um design is simple to use comm simple in features . "
B,Task,"Well yeah comm "
B,Task,"I mean it's really basic looking "
C,Task,"F f yeah f fairly basic comm "
B,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
B,Task,"I mean I'd give that nearly a one . "
C,Elicit,"you guys think ? "
D,Task,"Yeah one . "
A,Task,"Yep comm that's fine . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah comm one ? "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Um comm soft and spongy comm have we achieved that ? "
C,Task,"We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . "
D,Task,"Yeah I think it's about five . "
C,Elicit,"Five ? "
B,Elicit,"Five ? "
B,Task,"That's really low . "
D,Task,"Yeah well we have to use uh plastic "
D,Minor,"so it's probably gonna be "
B,Task,"Yeah I suppose mm 'kay . "
C,Minor,"That's "
C,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? "
A,Elicit,"company logo . "
C,Elicit,"Was that an option ? "
D,Task,"I think I'd probably increase the cost . "
A,Task,"I think it'll be cost prohibitive comm "
D,Task,"We've only got like what comm ten cents left so "
C,Elicit,"It would cost more than plastic . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Elicit,"logo comm we've got it in there comm haven't we ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
B,Elicit,"Gonna have that on the side comm aren't we comm "
B,Task,"like there or something ? "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Task,"And um it's within budget comm yep . "
C,Elicit,"It is comm isn't it ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"so we can say then that uh out of a possible "
C,Elicit,"or what would be our goal here ? "
B,Task,"Out of forty nine comm I guess . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . "
C,Task,"We are at uh two comm seven comm eight comm ten comm fifteen point five . "
B,Task,"'S pretty good . "
C,Task,"So it's pretty good . "
C,Task,"Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . "
C,Elicit,"Right ? "
B,Task,"Uh yeah . "
C,Task,"I think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about "
B,Task,"Twice that comm "
C,Task,"about thirty one comm "
B,Task,"about thirty one . "
C,Task,"and then invert that comm it's "
B,Task,"So yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine comm seventy percent yeah . "
C,Task,"Oh right comm about seventy comm yeah seventy percent . "
B,Minor,"It's pretty good . "
C,Task,"Okay comm good . "
C,Task,"That was just a little formality for us to go through . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Yep comm oh "
C,Other,"hundred pound pen . "
C,Other,"Sorry "
C,Minor,"alright . "
B,Other,"Nobody saw it comm honestly . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"The cameras did . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Is that you all have all finished comm or "
C,Task,"Yeah that's that's me . "
C,Task,"I did have one other um one other frame I thought comm "
C,Task,"I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information comm "
C,Task,"I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design comm revisiting our original goals . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"It's not something I need to p push through comm "
C,Task,"but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions comm um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the comm I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant comm "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"I dunno the "
C,Other,"Whatever "
C,Task,"just some theme and then we have different tones comm lime green comm lemon . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"It's just discussion . "
C,Task,"I mean obviously we can just abandon this comm "
C,Task,"it's fine . "
C,Task,"I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do . "
C,Minor,"Um comm yep "
B,Minor,"Right . "
C,Task,"so there . That's all . "
B,Task,"Okay comm great "
B,Elicit,"um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am I ? "
B,Task,"I don't know what your instructions have been . "
C,Task,"Um comm I think to record it and uh I haven't been asked to submit it yet . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"uh just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes comm "
B,Task,"because if you're submitting it anyway then "
C,Task,"I will comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay great . "
A,Task,"It keeps getting too big . "
B,Task,"Cool "
B,Minor,". Um right comm "
B,Task,"uh well next up then comm because we've done finance comm is the project evaluation . "
A,Task,"'Kay I'm I'm listening "
A,Task,"I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing comm so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well . "
B,Task,"Oh right comm okay . "
A,Task,"Just in case you're wondering comm why is he still playing with the Play-Doh ? "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Task,"Just about right "
A,Other,"L_E_G_O_ Lego . "
D,Other,"My leg . "
B,Minor,"Right comm okay . "
B,Task,"Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and "
B,Task,"or not those four points comm my four points comm "
B,Other,"sorry comm "
B,Task,"forgotten that . "
B,Minor,"You got a different uh "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . "
B,Task,"Oh yeah comm they're good aren't they comm yeah . "
C,Task,"It's really quick . "
B,Minor,"Right okay comm "
C,Task,"To use . "
B,Task,"um yeah here we are . "
B,Task,"Uh as a note we'll do this "
B,Task,"alphabetically . "
B,Task,"Um do you wanna start Andrew ? "
C,Task,"Sure comm "
C,Elicit,"um so what is it you're asking of me now ? "
B,Task,"I don't know comm "
B,Task,"just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them . "
C,Task,"Or sort of our work on setting this up . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Well comm is it "
C,Other,"uh okay I'll just go through your system then . "
C,Task,"The the room uh is fairly institutional comm "
C,Task,"but um the main thing is comm I think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive "
C,Task,"and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion comm you know comm "
C,Task,"as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity comm "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Task,"whereas in reality as we've gone through this comm it's not really the centre point of creativity comm it's more just a "
B,Elicit,"Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ? "
C,Task,"d debating "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah "
C,Minor,"but that's just "
C,Task,"the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there comm the room comm "
C,Task,"it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave comm and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then comm you know . "
B,Task,"But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room . "
B,Task,"I think it means like you know "
C,Task,"Oh comm "
C,Task,"oh right right comm oh right okay room for creativ "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard comm digital pens comm the room . "
B,Minor,"Room . "
B,Task,"Oh yeah . "
C,Task,"No comm of course comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Well I dunno "
B,Minor,"do you th "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Task,"I think it means um I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"I th okay on th um yeah dif "
C,Task,"answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity "
C,Task,"because we're asked to work through this comm but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends comm say fruit and vegetable colour scheme comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"So what do we do . "
C,Task,"We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology comm but build something for twelve and a half pounds comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual "
A,Task,"You feel like you're caged within whatever y "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah within the constraints "
A,Task,"It's like a balloon in a cage comm it can only go so big and not hit the side . "
C,Minor,"the "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"The constraints do come in very fast . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Other,"Okay uh do you know what comm "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it comm I think . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig . "
D,Task,"Um I agree with his point "
D,Task,"it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right comm gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so time is also a very s um strong factor comm and structure . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed comm um to be evaluated comm and to be reviewed comm and to get feedback and come back . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that comm I think that's a very big thing comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm sure . "
A,Task,"I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses comm right comm and that but that irritates me right "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"it it it does actually you know affect how comm w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . "
C,Task,"New creativity . "
A,Task,"I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment comm rather than the equipment is helping me comm and you know . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Right . "
B,Elicit,"So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or "
A,Task,"Not not so much an atmosphere comm "
A,Task,"the atmosphere is very relaxed comm "
A,Task,"but the the gear "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"but actual environment ? "
A,Task,"yeah "
A,Task,"you know that creates boundaries to that um "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"and and the time the time given also restricts "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Very good . "
B,Elicit,"Um what about leadership ? "
B,Task,"I don't know if that means like comm if I did a good job or something . "
B,Task,"I don't really know . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm well well I mean "
C,Task,"my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction comm encouragement "
B,Elicit,"From like your personal coach person and stuff like that comm do you think maybe ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah from "
C,Task,"and you as well I think comm just sort of acting as team leader . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Um yeah I think I think it's "
A,Other,"Excuse me . "
C,Task,"I think it's good . "
C,Task,"I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation comm "
C,Task,"but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"you know comm innovative thought with . "
C,Task,"In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within . "
C,Task,"And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member comm so "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh comm "
B,Minor,"okay . "
C,Task,"But it's not bad leadership comm it's just sort of s fairly strong comm you know . "
C,Task,"It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism comm as opposed to a sort of a free "
B,Elicit,"So you think maybe a little too controlling or "
C,Task,"Yeah comm oh yeah comm without without a doubt . "
A,Task,"I think controlling is not the right word comm "
A,Task,"I think the interactions are very structured . "
C,Task,"Yeah maybe not co confining . "
A,Task,"I think structure is probably what you're saying that comm each individual is structured to one particular task comm and one parti rather than controlling . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a comm like a consensus right comm we go around and we think about it comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"It doesn't tell you comm you know comm some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know comm not the "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Elicit,"uh what about teamwork ? "
C,Elicit,"Um did comm you wanna comment Craig ? "
D,Task,"Uh comm reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them comm that would've been a lot easier . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Fully agree . "
A,Task,"I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate comm "
A,Task,"but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"um it it doesn't have a comm you know comm a messenger will go . "
B,Elicit,"Did uh did you guys get the email I sent you ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Not just yet . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Oh that's alright . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm got the email . "
B,Task,"I was wondering if that got there okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm um so um to s to "
B,Task,"to summarize the teamwork issue comm saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting comm you know just like quick questions comm quick thoughts comm whatever comm it probably would be bit easier . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I think the tools that they were given comm the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration comm I think that's the word . "
C,Minor,"in it "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
C,Minor,"mm-hmm comm "
A,Task,"They don't support the team working together comm you know comm "
C,Minor,"mm-hmm comm "
B,Task,"Oh right comm okay . "
C,Task,"exactly . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I mean if you "
A,Task,"they're still very individual tools . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I mean sort of taking upon that idea comm w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork "
C,Task,"because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided comm and then the work went on in isolation "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I I don't know what you guys did while you were together comm maybe that was a bit different comm "
C,Minor,"but um "
A,Task,"We had Play-Doh fun . "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay comm first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept comm "
C,Task,"and we sit here together and do it comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"well that's what teamwork is . "
C,Task,"To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other comm it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I'm not dissatisfied with it . "
B,Minor,"Right comm "
B,Elicit,"uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ? "
A,Task,"No comm not really . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Elicit,"um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard comm the digital pens comm the projector comm stuff like that ? "
B,Elicit,"Um did anybody think anything was like really useful comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"anything was pretty un f "
B,Elicit,"unsupportive ? "
C,Task,"I think the whiteboard comm for me comm is the kind of thing I would use all the time comm "
C,Task,"but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been comm "
C,Task,"maybe just in the way that we we use it comm in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings comm that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Um comm and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . "
C,Task,"I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype "
C,Task,"and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product comm but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And point at ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"and and "
C,Task,"and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks comm "
C,Minor,"we're just "
C,Task,"we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . "
C,Task,"It wasn't until we had this here comm you know comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like comm now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book . "
B,Minor,"Ah . "
C,Task,"But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um "
B,Elicit,"So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ? "
C,Task,"Think could be comm yeah . "
A,Task,"I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"you know in the centre of the "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare comm "
C,Task,"whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush comm for example comm or whatever comm I would've actually used it comm "
B,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Minor,"um 'ca you know comm "
C,Task,"just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time . "
B,Task,"Okay uh "
A,Task,"I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints comm I don't think comm you know comm we needed to actually it could have comm we could have gone through it verbally comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"No comm "
C,Minor,"not quite . "
A,Task,"especially my slides comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I felt that they just you know "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"as opposed to having to present them . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"What about the digital pens comm did you find them easy enough to use ? "
D,Task,"Oh they're a bit clunky . "
C,Task,"Sure comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yep clunky . "
A,Task,"Agreed . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Clunky comm okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"'cause you're half way through a thought comm and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I know comm "
B,Task,"I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff comm didn't click note on one comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page comm but then did click note comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"and so I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something comm "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but they'll have my paper anyway um "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"and haven't done that since . "
A,Task,"But I think the pen is v is very intuitive comm "
A,Task,"everybody knows how to use it comm "
A,Task,"we don't have to worry . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"mm-hmm comm "
A,Task,"So I think the pen's good . "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"It's about the best thing . "
C,Task,"And o on the topic of the technology comm it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"It just occurred to me that they all "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Task,"we only needed one computer and "
C,Task,"We only actually needed one computer . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
C,Task,"If there had been a fifth comm that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time . "
D,Task,"Good point . "
A,Task,"And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something comm you know comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"it's useful but "
B,Elicit,"Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ? "
A,Task,"I think too many computers are just distracting . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that comm "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"um I don't know about anybody else . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Other,"what else "
B,Minor,"uh any wh I do "
B,Task,"I'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found . "
B,Task,"Um I don't know is "
D,Elicit,"Is this for the project or "
B,Elicit,"could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"comm the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"if we just had uh "
C,Task,"that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea comm "
C,Task,"well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Task,"I I dunno "
B,Task,"I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on "
B,Task,"and like my experience with meetings is that they really do comm and you can spend a lot of time talking about "
C,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design comm I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there "
B,Minor,"but um yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
C,Minor,"mm-hmm comm "
C,Minor,"mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room comm "
B,Task,"and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"just to have like something written down comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings comm but "
B,Other,"There you go . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Other,"Um so in closing comm "
B,Task,"I haven't got my five minutes to go . Thin "
B,Other,"Oh there it i "
B,Task,"Five minutes to go . "
B,Task,"Wonderful . "
B,Minor,"Okay um "
B,Task,"are the costs within the budget comm yes they are . "
B,Task,"And is the project evaluated comm yes it is . "
B,Task,"So now celebrate . "
C,Task,"Great . "
C,Minor,"So it "
A,Task,"And we have Ninja Homer . "
C,Elicit,"So now we "
D,Task,"Oh yeah . "

B,Elicit,"What are you guys doing now ? "
C,Task,"I I don't know . "
B,Other,"You dunno ? "
D,Task,"Oh wow . "

D,Task,"I said Ninja Homer . "
C,Other,"What did you call it ? "
A,Task,"Ninja Homer . "
A,Task,"See it looks like Homer Simpson "
C,Other,"Huh comm huh . "
A,Task,"but it's electronic so it's made in Japan . "
B,Elicit,"So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ? "
C,Other,"Logo . "
A,Task,"Yeah it's just a logo . "
B,Other,"Just a logo "
B,Task,"and then like Ninja Homer comm "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Task,"Ninja Homer . "
B,Task,"right okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"I think it's quite nice . "
C,Task,"Fashion technology or something . "
A,Other,"You can wear Homer comm "
A,Other,"you can throw Homer when you're frustrated comm doh . "
C,Other,"Hmm comm hmm comm hmm . "
B,Task,"Oh no comm that's cool comm "
B,Minor,"it's got "
B,Minor,"I'm kind of "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"It's clunky . "
B,Task,"I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber comm "
B,Task,"I think that would have been nice . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Other,"Ah well comm "
B,Task,"maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Oh comm I did learn something new comm Play-Doh is useful . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Other,"Play-Doh s "
A,Task,"No it is it is . "
A,Task,"It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing comm in being creative . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Elicit,"Really ? "
A,Task,"'Cause like you say comm it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else . "
B,Other,"Did they ? "
A,Task,"You might wanna write that down . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's just comm I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh comm and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Play-Doh . "
C,Task,"No comm it's true comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it smells funny doesn't it . Um "
C,Task,"And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible "
C,Elicit,"aren't they ? "
A,Task,"No comm all Play-Doh is edible . "
B,Minor,"Yeah like the stuff for "
D,Task,"I think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds . "
B,Task,"I think it has to be comm yeah . "
A,Task,"It's just wheat comm "
A,Task,"it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh "
C,Task,"Wow comm hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah um so to "
B,Elicit,"wha what are your summarising words about Play-Doh ? "
A,Task,"It's helpful to the creative process . "
C,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Task,"Um it engages all your senses not just your sight comm but your sense of feel your sense of touch . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Task,"And it helps you to understand "
C,Other,"Taste . "
A,Task,"dimension as well . "
A,Task,"I think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"whereas on a piece of paper comm on a computer comm on a board comm um even with a three D_ graphic thing it still comm it requires a lot of "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
C,Minor,"yep . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"it's not very tangible . "

B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm "
C,Minor,"mm-hmm comm "

B,Task,"Mm . I don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss . "
A,Task,"Nope . "
B,Task,"That that's about it really . "
B,Task,"Just sit still I guess for a little while . "
C,Elicit,"Do we retreat to our comm to continue our "
A,Task,"I think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate . "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"r reporting or what i "
B,Task,"Well I dunno . "
B,Task,"Um I'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now . "
