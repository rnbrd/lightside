Speaker,DialogAct,Text
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Other,"I will open our functional design meeting . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Other,"I will play role of the secretary . As also Program Ma Manager . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer comm User Interface Designer and um "
B,Task,"Industrial Design . "
A,Task,"Marketing Expert . "
C,Elicit,"What's your talk ? "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Marketing Experts . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements comm "
C,Task,"the decision on the remote control functions comm "
C,Task,"and we will close the meetings after . "
C,Minor,"Mm so um "
C,Task,"I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Um comm so you're participant two ? "
B,Task,"One one . "
D,Task,"No no no . "
C,Task,"No "
C,Elicit,"you're "
D,Task,"One . "
C,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"I'm participant one . "
B,Task,"Three three comm it's three "
B,Other,"sorry . "
D,Minor,"I I think I'm a . "
C,Other,"Okay comm never mind . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"'Kay comm "
C,Elicit,"did you save your presentation ? "
D,Task,"In one . "
B,Task,"In one comm "
B,Other,"sorry . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Isn't that technical functions ? "
A,Task,"No sure . "
B,Task,"So you didn't save it maybe . "
D,Task,"It's mine . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"Alright comm so "
A,Task,"it's David Jordan . Course . "
C,Other,"Name's Jordan . "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Other,"David Jordan ? Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Mm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"so I'll I let David Jordan do his presentation . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"No comm no . "
A,Task,"Uh this one doesn't want to be moved comm I think . "
C,Other,"Uh . "
B,Other,"Too great for email then . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so . "
D,Other,"The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Uh I I will focus on user interface design . "
D,Task,"Um so move to the next slide . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"As we know our "
D,Task,"remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions comm "
D,Task,"as we show from this picture . "
D,Task,"There's a lot of functions . "
D,Task,"Over comm I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . "
D,Elicit,"So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? "
D,Task,"Um comm let's move to next slide . "
D,Minor,"Um . Yeah . So "
D,Minor,"I "
D,Task,"so we want to design uh elegant comm easy to use inter interface . "
D,Task,"A very good example is Google . "
D,Task,"As we know uh Google it's a very successful "
D,Task,"because his um powerful function comm "
D,Task,"but with very easy to use user interface . "
D,Minor,"Um so "
D,Task,"move to next s slide . "
D,Other,"So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller "
D,Other,"which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation . "
C,Other,"So you propose to to have the "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Other,"remote control which will be powerful . "
D,Task,"With sophisticated functions comm "
D,Minor,"but with very "
C,Other,"So powerful comm "
D,Task,"yeah powerful . "
C,Other,"many functions "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Other,"and very easy to use . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"I dunno comm "
A,Task,"it's maybe difficult to have both comm "
B,Task,"To merge the two system huh . "
A,Task,"I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"You mean this one ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"you have to learn the manual before using this remote control comm I suppose . "
B,Task,"Mm yep . "
B,Minor,"But But this is "
D,Task,"But if we have very very good user interface "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"it take less time for user to learn how to use it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"and then "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"you maybe you have some international standards comm "
B,Task,"where you know comm if you can use one is the other are or almost the same comm so the sign . "
C,Other,"Oh "
C,Elicit,"you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"For example comm I dunno here comm escape comm you know comm you have escape in computers you have comm "
B,Task,"so if you see escape comm you know that it should be the same . "
A,Other,"Oh it should okay comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"So you have to The sh the user there "
A,Task,"The user should know . "
B,Task,"for example the power off button it is something very international comm "
B,Minor,"you know that "
B,Minor,"So . "
C,Minor,"Yeah um "
C,Task,"such as maybe the "
B,Minor,"Yeah . So . "
C,Task,"Go on comm go back "
C,Minor,"and "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system comm alright . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Other,"that's my job . "
A,Task,"that's gonna be the trick . "
B,Other,"That's your job "
D,Other,"That's my job . "
D,Task,"It's not the easiest I've got to . "
B,Minor,"It you "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Elicit,"you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . "
D,Task,"Yep . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Powerful and easy to use . "
A,Task,"So that's the point . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's the point . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things . "
B,Task,"Okay comm okay . "
C,Elicit,"So you you're "
B,Task,"Participant two . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Um . Okay . "
B,Minor,"The rationale must be design comm or "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Other,"Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . Okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"we can move to the next slide . "
B,Task,"As you all know comm you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . "
B,Task,"So the re basically the remote control will be comm you know comm infrared control comm "
B,Task,"so the problem is how to relate the "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"how to relate the remote control device comm like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"this one is leather bu based "
B,Task,"but "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I propose a nifra infrared base "
B,Minor,"you know comm so so "
B,Task,"for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ "
B,Minor,"so you know comm so "
B,Task,"it's it will be cheaper "
B,Task,"and it is less technology than comm you know "
B,Task,"For the cheap price we have comm for the cheap price we want to "
A,Task,"True . "
C,Elicit,"So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? "
B,Task,"I think it's cheaper than laser comm so . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? "
C,Task,"Twelve comm nearly thirteen comm "
A,Elicit,"What the cost is ? "
C,Task,"yeah . The cost "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh "
A,Task,"Twelve comm twelve a half . "
B,Minor,"Let's see . Yeah . "
B,Task,"You can move to the next slide comm so . "
B,Minor,"So the di the differen the findings "
B,Minor,"you know "
B,Task,"what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just comm you know a bulb and an infrared bulb comm "
B,Task,"so here for example the infrared bulb will be here "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . "
A,Minor,"That might just So . "
B,Task,"You can go to the next slide . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I have some kind of pictures "
B,Minor,"you know comm "
B,Task,"here . "
B,Task,"You have the b the bulb comm "
B,Task,"it is a blue the blue stuff here "
B,Task,"and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"you know "
B,Minor,"and so "
B,Task,"and you have the other subcomponent "
B,Task,"that are not really here so important comm so . "
C,Elicit,"What is this ? "
B,Task,"This is in fact some other component "
B,Task,"that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Look . "
B,Task,"But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"and the next slide comm "
B,Task,"it is the last one "
B,Minor,"it's So it's "
B,Task,"I think it should be wire wireless re remote con "
B,Task,"Because you know comm it's easier to manage "
B,Task,"and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . "
B,Task,"Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both comm "
B,Task,"but you know comm I at my side prefer a wireless . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"if you have some question I didn't answer ? "
A,Elicit,"What's the average price of this technology then ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"the avera the average prices "
B,Task,"I think that this technology will cost comm I dunno comm around eight Euros comm so . "
B,Minor,"Or at least you know comm the "
D,Elicit,"So what comm the wireless remote control ? "
D,Elicit,"There's a wire with remote control ? "
B,Minor,"You'd "
B,Task,"yes comm you can . "
B,Minor,"It's so so bres "
B,Task,"you have to decide how how you will you know comm put some energy inside comm "
B,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"you can think about wireless "
B,Minor,"or you know "
B,Task,"it's it's a question that we can raise comm so . "
B,Task,"We can think that you know comm with the wire comm you know comm without a wire . "
B,Task,"We can have both also . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"No "
C,Minor,"it wou "
C,Other,"maybe it will be cheaper I dunno "
C,Minor,"comm I just may maybe you making a solu "
A,Task,"But this is what you would like to ask the user first "
A,Task,"and I don't think the user would be ready to have a "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"Wireless remote control . "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but some pa "
A,Task,"I don't think well comm yeah comm I don't think he would comm "
B,Minor,"I always want to have you know comm "
A,Minor,"but in a sense "
B,Task,"sometime I want to have wire "
B,Minor,"because you know . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Elicit,"but as Industrial Designer comm do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? "
C,Task,"I'm just asking you . "
C,Elicit,"Do you think it will be cheaper ? "
B,Task,"Uh comm I don't think it will be too much . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Could you answer please ? "
B,Other,"Have to think about the question comm "
B,Minor,"you know comm "
B,Minor,"'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper "
B,Task,"but you know the wireless it's more practical comm so . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"As it's "
A,Other,"The wire ? "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . True . "
B,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
C,Task,"I think it's more your problem . "
C,Task,"Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research "
C,Task,"or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"that's my job . "
A,Minor,"That's the "
C,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Other,"I'm sorry . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Now the "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"but comm it should be an agreement comm "
B,Minor,"you know comm "
B,Task,"because even if you can think of the wireless comm it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer comm "
B,Minor,"but you know . "
B,Task,"If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have comm if you want to use comm so it can be good to have a wireless comm "
B,Elicit,"it it is a question . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"just think of um the usability . "
D,Elicit,"Design a wireless remote control . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Just think of the problem . "
C,Elicit,"If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television comm "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"that's actually one of the point comm "
A,Elicit,"yeah ? "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"True . "
A,Task,"This you will see in my presentation then . "
C,Task,"So I will let you to do your presentation comm so . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Which is participant four . "
A,Task,"So just trying to answer all the questions comm "
A,Elicit,"if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . "
A,Task,"We've made a study comm "
A,Task,"so could you go to next slide . "
A,Other,"Sorry for the functional recurrence . "
A,Task,"So that's the standard method for marketing comm "
A,Elicit,"okay . "
A,Task,"We had one hundred subjects comm "
A,Task,"um comm we observe their remote control use in a lab "
A,Task,"and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire comm um comm "
A,Task,"and see what was okay or not for them . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . "
A,Task,"Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly comm "
A,Elicit,"okay comm "
A,Minor,"so that's "
C,Elicit,"You mean the loo the look comm the outside ? "
B,Task,"The look comm how it look like . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm the the look is is bad for them "
A,Minor,"so uh "
A,Task,"it's your job comm David comm maybe . "
A,Task,"Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . "
A,Task,"So this is where we could have uh yeah comm good market comm I guess comm if people are ready to pay more . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"it's it's interesting information comm I think . "
A,Task,"And then um yeah comm the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime comm "
A,Task,"because it's too many buttons and so on . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we should change this as well . "
A,Task,"And uh users are actually zapping a lot comm "
A,Task,"so they're using the device intensively comm "
A,Task,"that's something to take into account as well . "
A,Minor,"And um comm you know comm "
A,Task,"ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . "
A,Task,"And uh this is one of the main point for me . "
A,Other,"But I'll come back to it later . "
A,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Could you go next slide ? "
A,Task,"Uh comm so as you said uh comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"this is from the experiments we've done comm "
A,Task,"so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user comm I think . "
A,Task,"Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . "
A,Task,"And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . "
C,Elicit,"What is R_S_I_ ? "
A,Task,"R_S_I_ is like comm when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times comm then you get injured . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Ah um okay . "
A,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"those numbers are less important then the previous one comm "
A,Task,"but still it has to be taken to count . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"last slide . "
A,Task,"Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . "
A,Task,"If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent comm "
A,Elicit,"okay . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And definitely if it could have less buttons comm still maybe the same number of um functions comm but less buttons comm "
D,Task,"Functions . "
A,Task,"this would definitely be a good way of selling more . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Mm okay . "
C,Elicit,"And just to have uh an idea comm do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control comm you think it's possible ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Sure ? Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think possible . "
D,Task,"Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So lets you then you have less buttons . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"but do you think it will be easy to use ? "
D,Minor,"But I'm not sure "
C,Task,"Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"remember "
A,Task,"the user is not happy to read the "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"The manuals . "
C,Minor,"I think the "
A,Task,"manual . "
A,Minor,"It's "
D,Task,"No "
D,Task,"you you can have a switch menu comm "
D,Minor,"so you can "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"but it has to be intuitive . "
D,Minor,"for example "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
D,Task,"Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . "
D,Task,"Then for um you can have a switch menu comm "
D,Task,"so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . "
C,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Other,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"Then you you put the switch button comm "
C,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"then it "
D,Task,"switch to another category of functions . Yeah . "
D,Task,"For example comm if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ "
D,Task,"and also you can control your uh recorder . "
B,Minor,"With a "
D,Task,"So there's a different functions comm "
D,Task,"but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . "
D,Task,"So we can has less buttons . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy comm not funny . "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"Look fancy . "
B,Task,"This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people comm maybe the the marketing people . "
D,Task,"Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"this is something we sh "
D,Task,"Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people comm "
D,Task,"but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples comm so . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"But this was first step and "
A,Task,"This was the first step comm yeah . "
B,Task,"I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . "
A,Task,"Specially distribution comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm maybe . Yeah comm maybe . "
C,Task,"If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm personalised colour . Because you know "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it will cost little bit more . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"because maybe some people prefer a red remote control comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"some people prefer black remote control . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but this is what we would ask to the users comm so . "
C,Minor,"And also f "
D,Task,"Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"so user can select which colour they prefer comm so . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but as soon as you speak about options comm it means that the price increases comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"remember it's twelve Euros . "
C,Task,"and we don't really want the price to be too too high comm "
C,Task,"because we wanna be able to produce it . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"we want something fancy comm "
C,Task,"as uh previously said comm Florent comm "
C,Task,"something very easy to use comm powerful "
C,Task,"and also as uh it's written here comm "
C,Task,"seventy five percent of users comm they zap lot comm "
C,Task,"so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"they want to zap between channels on T_V_ . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"I think you have quite lot of points to to think about "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and to discuss it with uh the other members . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Elicit,"is it okay for your presentation ? "
C,Elicit,"Nothing else to to add ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's done comm "
A,Task,"just yeah . If we would if we could remember like comm not too many buttons and make it look fancy comm I think it would make it . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Mm so "
C,Minor,"So comm "
A,Minor,"So . "
C,Task,"I had some "
C,Task,"new information about the product requirements comm "
C,Task,"so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking comm in your designing of the remote control . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"as it's something that's "
C,Minor,"It's is uh "
A,Task,"Lame comm "
C,Other,"No "
A,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"because now everybody has internet at home comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"so it's better to use internet then teletext . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control comm "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"and also the remote control will only be used for television comm "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Minor,"for y for you your designing comm you're not you won't be uh "
C,Task,"you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . "
D,Task,"Control . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"It's "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm "
C,Task,"because if we want to "
C,Task,"to do remote control "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"which will be used for for the television comm for the recorder comm for the camcorder and all the others comm it will become too complex "
C,Task,"and it will increase the pli the price "
C,Task,"and we can't do that . "
C,Task,"We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . "
C,Elicit,"Is it okay ? "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"But there's balance between function and the cost . "
C,Task,"So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it comm to have very powerful and easy . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
C,Task,"And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product comm such as the colour and s the slogan . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"So you will have to use the colour of the product comm of the um um "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"of the uh of real reaction "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So . "
C,Minor,"and uh also "
A,Elicit,"So has to be yellow . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yellow . "
C,Task,"As we say comm we put the fashion in electronics comm "
C,Task,"so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy comm fashion comm powerful comm easy to use . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Require lot of requirements comm "
C,Minor,"but "
