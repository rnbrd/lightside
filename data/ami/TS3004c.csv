D,Other,"Bonjour . "
B,Minor,"It's "
B,Task,"It won't wake up . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I was a bit early . "
B,Minor,"Like "
D,Elicit,"Why ? "
B,Other,"What ? "
B,Minor,"No comm "
B,Task,"I just came in . "
B,Task,"Uh normally I was one of them . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Come on . "
D,Other,"Check check check check . "
A,Other,"Hello . "
B,Elicit,"Why won't it wake up ? "
A,Other,"Oop . "
B,Elicit,"Is it on ? "
D,Task,"The power light doesn't work . "
D,Task,"You turned it off . "
B,Elicit,"But how ? "
B,Minor,"Ah comm "
B,Task,"there it is . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
C,Task,"I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . "
C,Other,"So I'll discuss them with you . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we're just going to the later . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I received an email as well . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we're going to talk about the conceptual model . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Which one was mine ? "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"that's me . "
A,Minor,"Uh okay . So Uh okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Other,"I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes comm minute . "
A,Elicit,"What's it called comm "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"Whatever . "
B,Task,"The minutes . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Minor,"we just talked about uh "
A,Elicit,"Oh you want me to show that there "
A,Minor,"or "
D,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"Mm no . "
B,Task,"just tell us . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we just talked about it looks . "
A,Task,"Has to look nice . "
A,Task,"Usability is very important . "
A,Task,"People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um "
A,Task,"It has to be very basic comm "
A,Task,"not too many buttons . "
A,Task,"Light switches on if you use a button . "
A,Task,"Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility . "
A,Task,"And it has to be easy to learn . "
A,Task,"That were the things I uh make minutes of . "
A,Task,"And the functions are volume comm channel to choose channels comm an on-off comm a mute uh button comm and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions . "
A,Elicit,"That right ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I just want to give you uh Mike again comm the first uh presentation "
A,Minor,"of your "
D,Elicit,"Shall I start ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"No . "
D,Minor,"Okay well "
D,Task,"I received an email "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I searched the web comm "
D,Task,"uh and uh I searched uh on this d document comm recent investigation of the remote control market . "
D,Task,"It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe comm "
D,Task,"I forget it . "
D,Task,"Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel comm instead of the current functional look and feel . "
D,Task,"So it's very important for us to create something new . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"what Michael just said comm "
D,Task,"it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . "
D,Task,"Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . "
D,Task,"Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . "
D,Task,"Uh it came out of the research . "
D,Task,"It uh is twice important as the following . "
D,Task,"The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . "
D,Task,"Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . "
D,Task,"And then uh that uh This is a point of discussion comm "
D,Task,"because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"But um this is the second uh important uh aspect comm "
D,Task,"and I think uh we must use some of the new technology comm to be uh innovative . "
A,Task,"But we already have the flashing flashing light "
A,Minor,"on the "
D,Task,"Uh maybe maybe something new . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm more . "
D,Task,"We have to discuss about it "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"s "
D,Minor,"uh Okay comm uh "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"I'll I'll get back on it . "
D,Task,"features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . "
D,Task,"And that's very hard I think . "
D,Task,"Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . "
D,Task,"But uh that was an overall uh point . "
D,Task,"We already discussed that . "
D,Task,"Um I've got one picture . "
D,Task,"Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So I took uh that part of the webpage . "
D,Task,"And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari uh France and uh Italy comm yeah comm uh have detected the following trends . "
D,Task,"This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us comm maybe . "
D,Task,"But it's about uh clothes and shoes . "
D,Task,"But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year comm the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Spongy . "
D,Elicit,"But spongy comm what what does spongy says ? "
C,Task,"Spongy . "
B,Task,"Spongy comm like sponge . "
D,Other,"Spongy . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So rubber comm kind of . "
B,Task,"Uh soft materials . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea comm "
A,Task,"because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but Yeah . "
A,Task,"So it has to be flexible . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
D,Task,"it's something that uh it stand there . "
D,Task,"But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . "
D,Elicit,"So spongy means "
D,Other,"y Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's like a sponge . "
B,Task,"Soft comm sponge . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"it's also a stress-ball . "
A,Task,"That's a good That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good comm a good idea . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"somewhat like "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"How are you gonna make it ? "
A,Elicit,"Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ? "
A,Task,"R_ soft . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I've some uh material uh information comm "
C,Other,"but I'll give you it later in my presentation . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Okay ? "
D,Elicit,"What do I think ? "
D,Task,"Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control comm "
D,Task,"I think about changeable fronts . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . "
D,Task,"Because it's uh it's hot . "
D,Task,"And uh some basic uh colour fronts . "
D,Task,"Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . "
D,Task,"Uh maybe an extraordinary shape comm like a sponge . "
D,Minor,"Uh or uh comm yeah comm "
D,Task,"just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has . "
D,Task,"Just uh something round in it comm or uh maybe not uh not uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I dun dunno . "
D,Task,"We have to discuss about that . "
D,Minor,"Uh y yeah . "
D,Task,"Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"how do we do that ? "
D,Elicit,"Maybe speech ? "
D,Task,"We ma must have some kind of gadget . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Other,"I'll get back on that . "
D,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"It's very uh difficult to to to do it . "
D,Minor,"Intro "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"that's the problem . That's the main problem . "
B,Task,"I got f also an email from "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"the the technology department . "
D,Task,"Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations . "
B,Task,"They have done uh research about it comm "
B,Task,"and uh even more possibilities now with speech . "
B,Task,"So they recommended using it . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Well "
C,Other,"Hmm . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then . "
B,Other,"I'll check what they exact mean . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm well "
C,Task,"actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . "
C,Task,"But maybe it's cheap "
C,Task,"and it's easy to implement . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"th that's the only problem . "
B,Minor,"I d "
B,Task,"They don't say how much it will cost comm "
B,Minor,"so Um but uh "
B,Task,"if we implement uh speech recognition comm I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well . "
D,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"It's mass production . "
D,Minor,"So you can say comm you can "
B,Task,"Since you have to uh configure speech thing . "
A,Task,"But that's definitely more expensive "
A,Minor,"than "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"that's that's something I dunno . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"But how "
D,Task,"uh we we're gonna make many of those . "
D,Task,"So we can start a mass production comm "
D,Task,"and then the cost will still will be . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"but a telephone "
A,Minor,"Okay comm yeah . "
A,Task,"But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"so uh "
B,Minor,"we gotta de "
A,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"We have to decide on that . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"That was this ? "
B,Minor,"Mm uh "
C,Minor,"Oh "
C,Task,"I got an email uh "
C,Task,"And it says uh the chip can be uh simple comm regular or advanced . "
C,Minor,"And Um "
C,Task,"They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . "
C,Task,"And this is more expensive than all the other chips . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"it's m the most expensive . "
B,Other,"L_D_C_ doesn't require "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"it says in the email . "
C,Task,"The display requires an advanced chip . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"And speech recognition ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm probably too . "
B,Other,"Advanced . Yeah . "
C,Task,"I I haven't got anything about speech recognition comm "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Other,"I'll I'll give you my design . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"it d "
C,Task,"That's that's the most expensive chip comm we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display . "
B,Task,"Yeah okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"we "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"we can "
B,Task,"I had uh to make a sort of a design . "
B,Task,"So I did some searching on the internet . "
B,Task,"I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . "
B,Minor,"I think we should um "
B,Task,"This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . "
B,Task,"I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"just modern modern but still uh basic . "
B,Task,"More modern . Y yes . "
B,Task,"Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . "
B,Task,"'Cause remote con control comm you can see it here comm you have to bo reach both out both sides . "
B,Task,"And here you just have one comm few buttons . "
B,Task,"So that's that's the main difference . "
B,Minor,"But looks "
B,Task,"uh I definitely think we should go like this . "
B,Task,"And then changeable fonts comm "
B,Minor,"so "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"It's the most important part comm I think . "
B,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"And the home base is something like that comm something simple . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . "
B,Task,"Uh basic buttons . On-off comm mute . And th maybe two others comm I dunno . Text buttons . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"maybe the teletext tel "
B,Task,"Yeah comm text button comm "
B,Task,"maybe there and there . "
B,Task,"And then the colour buttons comm if we want it on . "
B,Task,"I don't find it very usable comm "
B,Minor,"but it's "
D,Task,"No comm I don't uh I don't like it . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"and then yeah we saw the the pla display comm in the the iPod . "
B,Task,"They can put the basic buttons comm one comm two comm three comm four . And uh f above ten . "
B,Minor,"And I think "
C,Minor,"But it "
C,Elicit,"That's on on the display . "
B,Task,"No no . "
B,Task,"That th there is no display there . "
B,Task,"But it's on the place of the display . "
B,Task,"And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part . "
B,Task,"So the focus is on these two parts . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So you don't see all the buttons you else need . "
A,Task,"But it sounds very difficult to use . "
A,Task,"Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it . "
B,Minor,"Uh well um "
A,Task,"So you can't use your thumb for it . "
B,Task,"This is how it is now . Um "
B,Task,"Here uh Well we have volume . "
C,Task,"I think it is on uh on the bottom too . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"down there . "
A,Task,"But it's not not the best best . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Well "
B,Task,"here we have also side scrolls . "
B,Elicit,"I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"for volume . For volume comm or a channel . "
C,Task,"I've I've got something of that uh too . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm why not . "
B,Other,"For volume ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"then we can even simplify it more . "
C,Minor,"Scroll . "
B,Task,"By just putting the volume on the side . "
B,Task,"And and just channel buttons here . "
A,Elicit,"And the channels as well . "
A,Other,"Oh "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"But I think uh "
C,Minor,"or uh maybe uh "
C,Task,"The channel buttons are often used . "
C,Task,"And you can't use them now with your thumb comm "
C,Task,"because the thing is not comm it's not easy to control . "
B,Minor,"Well . Yeah comm well "
B,Task,"it's Basically it's it's here . "
C,Other,"Yeah okay comm "
C,Task,"m maybe we cho should put that on top comm "
C,Task,"and buttons we we don't use on comm in the bottom . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's better . "
B,Other,"They're on top ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom . "
C,Task,"Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons . "
B,Elicit,"You mean uh these to the low ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Except from the on-off button . "
B,Other,"Oh okay . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons comm like one two three . "
C,Task,"So maybe we can put that on the bottom . "
B,Task,"Mm Maybe . I dunno comm "
B,Minor,"but yeah we'll "
C,Task,"Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"maybe it's not easy if it's below . "
B,Task,"It's harder to zap . "
B,Task,"So I think uh it should be should be easy to . "
B,Task,"I think it's pretty standard comm these rubber buttons on the top . "
C,Task,"Yeah okay . "
C,Task,"That's that's good comm "
B,Task,"And uh if you don't light 'em up comm they don't uh you don't see 'em very good . "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"I think it's modern to light this area up comm and to light this area up . "
B,Task,"So the focus gets on these parts and not on there . "
C,Task,"Yeah okay . "
B,Task,"But uh the position of course can be different . "
B,Minor,"It's s "
B,Task,"We have to look uh what's easy to use comm and how it's easier to use . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So we can uh switch these to "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"I dunno if it l will look good comm if you put those on t on the bottom half . "
C,Minor,"No comm "
C,Task,"I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"But uh we we can switch those two comm "
B,Minor,"maybe "
B,Task,"Those two comm yeah . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"And uh comm yeah comm "
B,Minor,"you have to make sure it's easy to uh "
B,Minor,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"it has to be big enough "
B,Task,"so you can hold it comm "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"right . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"that's that's my findings . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . "
B,Minor,"And uh well um "
B,Task,"if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something comm we I don't think we should put it on top then . "
B,Task,"I think that comm if we're gonna put in more technology comm that you need to be able to uh switch it open . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"To use "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm that's cool . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"if you put in uh speech recognition comm you need so more uh many more buttons . "
B,Task,"Which won't look good on the front side I think . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"that's something we have to decide on . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"we have to keep it simple . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We have to decide this this lecture comm or this this this uh fifty minutes comm yeah comm how it is gonna look . "
B,Elicit,"What we're gonna do . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"the component design . "
C,Task,"I looked at uh some similar devices comm and uh my own common knowledge . "
C,Minor,"So uh "
C,Task,"this was on the web site . "
C,Task,"If you aim at a young public comm you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green comm blue comm red . So flashy kinda colours . "
C,Task,"Uh shapes should be curved comm so round shapes . Not Nothing square-like . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Minor,"Hmm comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah well uh "
B,Task,"iPod is trendy . "
B,Task,"And it is well curved square . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Square . Like . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but mm is uh has round corners I think . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So not "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing . "
B,Other,"Yeah okay . "
B,Task,"Not uh the old uh box look . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . "
C,Task,"I don't know exactly what that means comm "
C,Task,"but it should be comm well yeah comm popular kind of "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"looking comm I think . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Mm Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"the colours also . "
B,Minor,"it's "
A,Task,"So we have ha to ma make it in black comm black comm yellow . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Black yellow control . "
A,Task,"Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm mm "
C,Task,"n Not that weird comm "
C,Task,"because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy comm to attract a young public . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm but uh "
B,Task,"I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . "
B,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"No comm okay . "
A,Minor,"We make i "
A,Task,"Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . "
C,Minor,"That's a that's a sen "
C,Task,"That's just a matter of tastes comm "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"We have to use uh kind of flashy colours comm I think . "
B,Elicit,"Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts comm with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's cool . Yep . "
C,Task,"Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue "
A,Minor,"And still trans "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"and "
D,Task,"Oh yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Still still transparent . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . But with all with logo on it . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"this is a remote control comm a very old one . "
C,Task,"Um Then the components . "
C,Task,"The case has just a Here's black . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"we make it som "
A,Task,"Maybe we have to make it from soft material . "
A,Task,"Uh I'm not sure . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I dunno . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Maybe . "
C,Task,"But anyways uh it should be transparent . "
C,Task,"We decided that comm "
C,Elicit,"huh ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"S "
B,Task,"one of the options . "
B,Minor,"You can "
B,Task,"Just like a mobile phone comm you can make um different fronts on it . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So you can just replace them I think . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we could do that . "
B,Task,"That was the idea comm "
B,Task,"or just uh release one . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Just give five with them comm just in a box . Five different "
B,Task,"Yeah comm uh "
B,Task,"Or just uh sell different ones . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent . "
C,Task,"So you can still th look through it . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Cool . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I uh I dunno . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"A more "
A,Task,"It it could be like a Nokia comm like plastic . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"just uh "
D,Minor,"Uh uh "
C,Task,"With the hard hard buttons . "
A,Task,"That's better prob "
B,Task,"I think uh rubber really has an odd look . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls comm uh the buttons are part of the uh the style comm I think is part of the remote control itself . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . "
D,Minor,"Uh it's n doesn't Is uh a button uh um "
D,Other,"How do you say it ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"It it didn't it i "
C,Task,"it's it's all on one level . "
D,Task,"it don't come out of the on the background . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"on one level . "
D,Minor,"It is in uh the c a remote control uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I know what you mean . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"we have to keep it on the one level . "
C,Minor,"Like th the top it's "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"like mobile phones . "
B,Task,"Like uh the iPod . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Uh just "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's cool . "
C,Minor,"it's chos "
C,Task,"So that should be hard plastic . "
C,Elicit,"Then the buttons ? "
C,Minor,"I think . Or maybe "
B,Task,"I dunno what uh kind of material it is . "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Just only the basic uh "
B,Other,"Oops . "
A,Task,"basic remote control from normal plastic comm "
A,Minor,"and "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"the rounds of it from softer s "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And um Then the L_E_D_ . "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
C,Task,"The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . "
C,Task,"And back light L_E_D_s . "
A,Minor,"Y "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Cool . "
C,Task,"But I think we have to make the case transparent comm "
C,Task,"otherwise the back light won't work . "
C,Minor,"So if you put "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh "
A,Minor,"Y i if you The numbers could be can be "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Or it runs the whole "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but we can still make it transparent . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"They can choose . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"you can halfs transparent comm "
C,Elicit,"Or no "
B,Task,"or just that it's comes out a bit . "
C,Other,"Yeah okay . "
C,Task,"Good . "
C,Elicit,"And in green colour comm the back lights "
C,Minor,"or "
B,Task,"Different comm I think comm also . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"Blue . "
B,Task,"Blue or red . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Whatever you want it comm I think . "
B,Minor,"Uh depends on the colour of the "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it . "
D,Minor,"Uh i "
A,Minor,"You have to choose "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
B,Minor,"But "
C,Minor,"No comm "
C,Task,"but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Is it "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? "
C,Minor,"I I know I dunno . Is "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it can . "
D,Minor,"You "
B,Task,"'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive . "
A,Task,"Maybe put some different ones in it . "
A,Other,"Doesn't matter . "
C,Minor,"I think it's "
A,Task,"It's just No comm just some LED . "
B,Task,"I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone . "
B,Task,"And I can change the colour of it . "
A,Task,"Okay comm cool . "
A,Task,"Just make it some different colours . Blue comm red and green comm or something . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
C,Task,"Maybe it's too expensive comm "
C,Task,"but it I th I don't think so . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . So "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Then uh some more technical things . "
C,Task,"I don't know what it is comm "
C,Task,"but it should be there I think . "
C,Task,"Um this is the normal circuit board comm like a chip board in in a lot of uh things . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"we have to hurry up a bit comm "
C,Minor,"W "
C,Task,"So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things . "
A,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls . "
B,Task,"I'm sure we can fit in . "
C,Task,"So I guess we j we just need that . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I don't know what they do "
C,Minor,"or "
D,Task,"Okay yeah comm "
B,Task,"Yeah okay . "
B,Minor,"We just "
D,Task,"you can you can change "
D,Other,"Yeah . No . "
C,Task,"Nah comm "
C,Task,"but they just said we need it . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh the battery contacts comm like normal batteries ca you can put in . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"a recharger maybe . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"we have to make sure to uh "
C,Task,"Yeah okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Elicit,"We still want to have a recharger comm don't we ? "
C,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"Is that still the "
B,Task,"Yes . Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but it i We don't wanna have a ar an "
C,Elicit,"How do you call it ? Accu . "
A,Minor,"A recha "
A,Task,"Oh no . "
B,Task,"Re recharger . Base station . "
C,Minor,"Y "
A,Task,"Uh Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah . "
C,Task,"uh just just batteries comm rechargeable batteries . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm batteries . "
B,Task,"Yes comm rechargeable batteries comm I think's best . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Not a separate "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"just rechargeable batteries . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"And uh a chip comm that's this one . "
C,Task,"Then uh I received some possibilities . "
C,Task,"Um for the energy source we can use batteries "
C,Task,"or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"it operates on your wrist kinda . "
D,Other,"Ah "
D,Task,"cool . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"if you hold it comm it gets powered . "
C,Task,"If you hold it . "
A,Task,"But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I don't think it will work comm "
C,Minor,"and "
C,Task,"Or we can also use solar cells . "
C,Task,"But you mostly use it indoors comm "
A,Task,"It's dark in the room . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"It's just batteries comm "
C,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"that's cheaper . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"and and we can use the home station kind of thing . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Um cases comm "
C,Task,"flat comm so uncurved . "
C,Task,"Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . "
C,Task,"And three D_ curved is also in depth . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"that's possible . "
C,Task,"Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls comm we must use rubber buttons . "
C,Task,"So we can't use the flat buttons . "
B,Other,"Mm . So "
B,Task,"we need uh two D_ . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Definitely . "
C,Task,"Um these kinda materials can be used . "
A,Task,"But it doesn't really matter comm "
A,Task,"we just make it plastic . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think so too . "
A,Task,"The scroll wheels comm that's cool . "
A,Task,"That's for the volume . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"scroll wheels um "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's good . "
C,Task,"We can use multiple scroll wheels comm w if we want to . "
C,Task,"But I think just the volume is enough . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh For channels it's not handy comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"because you scroll too fast . "
C,Task,"And uh the L_C_D_ . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we need uh the expensive comm most expensive chip comm if we use an L_C_D_ . "
D,Minor,"Mm "
A,Task,"I don't think that's an opportunity . "
A,Task,"Just skip it . "
A,Task,"Because we don't have time for that to to put it in . "
C,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . "
C,Task,"Because we use scroll wheels . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"And um Yeah comm "
C,Task,"that was it I guess . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Uh are are we using a a rubber case comm "
C,Minor,"or "
A,Minor,"Oh "
C,Task,"We haven't decided yet . "
A,Minor,"just sk "
A,Task,"Maybe you have to skip that one as well . "
A,Minor,"It's "
B,Minor,"Uh I don't think a rubber case looks "
D,Task,"Uh but we have to do something about the trend . "
C,Minor,"L "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"i it it should be soft . "
C,Elicit,"You said so ? "
D,Task,"The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Minor,"That Uh fruit and veg comm or "
D,Task,"And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"fruit and veg can be just the covers . "
D,Task,"Uh yeah i Just Just on front . "
B,Minor,"So you can the the spongy "
B,Minor,"yeah comm "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"I can't imagine a soft remote control . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"Neith uh I don't like it uh neither . "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"I just can't imagine it . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"just hard plastic ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think . "
B,Elicit,"Titanium . "
B,Task,"It's mentioned here uh . "
C,Task,"Titanium comm uh I think it's too expensive . "
A,Task,"But maybe the form has to be a bit different . "
A,Task,"Not the sh the square form . "
A,Task,"Just a bit "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"you can make it curved or mm round . "
A,Task,"more rounded . "
C,Task,"But just in two D_ comm not in depth . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . "
A,Task,"Because we have to know it . "
A,Task,"So the energy uh is the recharger . "
A,Task,"We already know that . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Just a normal battery . "
B,Task,"We have batteries . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"The chip-on-print is a normal one . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Regular . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"the case is just a plastic one . "
C,Task,"Yeah th yeah comm the chip is the the regular one . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm re Yeah comm regular . Yeah comm okay . Yeah comm regular . "
C,Task,"You have the simple one comm regular and advanced . "
C,Task,"So it's b should be regular uh the second . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"I think I'll just check it . "
A,Task,"And we need a plastic case comm with a scroll wheel . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"That's pretty much it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"User interface concept . "
A,Task,"And a flashy light . "
A,Minor,"So uh "
A,Task,"I'm not sure . "
A,Elicit,"But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . "
A,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"I dunno either . "
C,Elicit,"Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ? "
B,Task,"Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"So we should did it here ? "
A,Task,"That's for the next one . "
B,Elicit,"So we're staying here ? "
A,Minor,"That's for th "
C,Elicit,"Or should we do it in the next meeting ? "
A,Task,"Uh that I think that's the next next meeting . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"But you definitely get a specific instruction . "
B,Other,"Okay comm "
B,Minor,"so "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ? "
A,Task,"But th think about something that's more rounded . "
A,Minor,"Just And more "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm uh "
A,Minor,"It has to be "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"But the iPod and etcetera comm M_P_ three players comm mobile phones . "
A,Task,"Uh a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom . "
B,Other,"Just a bit "
B,Minor,"cur "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Other,"I'll see if I can see any of those . "
A,Task,"Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . "
A,Minor,"O um if you draw it like this comm you get a "
A,Other,"What the fuck is it ? "
A,Minor,"Okay . Mm "
A,Task,"Doesn't work . "
A,Elicit,"You see what I mean ? "
A,Task,"If I draw here "
C,Other,"What ? "
A,Task,"It draws about four centimetres lower "
C,Other,"Oh . Okay . "
A,Minor,"than "
A,Other,"Nah okay . "
A,Minor,"Just . "
A,Task,"Maybe you can make it like this . "
A,Task,"And this is all the wheel for volume . "
A,Minor,"So that you just um "
A,Task,"It's all rounded comm "
A,Task,"so you can do uh turn this one . "
C,Elicit,"Like a very big scroll-wheel . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but just not on the top comm but uh on the side of it . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Maybe comm I dunno . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"we have this at the moment . "
C,Task,"I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"you "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"we'd have this . "
A,Elicit,"Is that okay ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I think it's probably better . "
B,Task,"that's a little problem comm of course comm as well . "
A,Minor,"And "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but maybe we can make a a plastic comm "
C,Task,"so that you i if you like drop it comm it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"maybe you just have to make it uh That's not scrollable too easy . "
A,Task,"Like this . "
A,Elicit,"And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ? "
C,Task,"I think in middle . "
A,Elicit,"Still on the bottom "
A,Minor,"or "
B,Elicit,"Uh wh what is the middle part ? "
A,Task,"That's the numbers . "
C,Task,"Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom comm and and the switch channel in the middle . "
B,Other,"Numbers comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I agree as well . "
B,Minor,"Use the dz "
A,Task,"It doesn't make a difference comm if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . "
A,Task,"Because you already have the volume here comm "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other . back and forth . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
A,Task,"So you can also can put it all on the top comm "
A,Task,"and this comm you keep this empty . "
A,Task,"Because you have to hold it as well . "
C,Task,"Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . "
A,Task,"But that's not "
A,Task,"want to zap very quick comm "
A,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"I think uh zapping is the highest priority . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? Is this a opportunity comm "
B,Minor,"And then you use those uh "
A,Elicit,"or you don't want a different "
B,Task,"Yeah comm of course uh . "
C,Task,"Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other comm "
C,Minor,"so "
A,Elicit,"Why ? "
C,Task,"Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up "
A,Task,"But still the next It's still the next one . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Doesn't make "
C,Task,"but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up comm "
C,Minor,"and down button is If you put them "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but fo from left to right is exactly the same . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It ma it doesn't make a big difference . "
B,Minor,"I I think it's "
C,Task,"But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume comm and top down is more with uh channel changing . "
B,Task,"It's it's obvious comm I think . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"that's not not It's not al uh always the same . "
A,Minor,"But it's exactly th "
C,Task,"In uh On most on most remote controls . "
D,Task,"Every remote control's uh different . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"I think "
C,Task,"So so if we use that comm they will probably have a long learning uh time . "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"I "
A,Task,"You already have the volume on the side comm "
B,Minor,"uh I think "
A,Task,"so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So it's uh "
B,Task,"I think it's s so simple "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"you just "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"but that's for that's for you comm "
A,Minor,"'cause it's "
B,Other,"Yeah comm okay I'll d I'll take a look at it . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so hmm . "
A,Elicit,"What did What else we have to discuss about ? "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Elicit,"Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"we have to care that it r uh looks really new . "
D,Task,"Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . "
A,Task,"And the LED . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Minor,"you have uh It is "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but i i it should be round in in shape . "
B,Task,"Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic . "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"You have to look at that image of the iPod . "
D,Minor,"Yes . Okay . "
B,Task,"More that uh kind of style . "
D,Minor,"And a bit uh "
B,Task,"Not not the old grey black "
A,Minor,"Uh Yeah . "
D,Task,"Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have "
B,Minor,"Where you can put a ve Uh we have "
B,Task,"If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh the logo was has to be on there . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
D,Elicit,"Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? "
D,Elicit,"Uh five or something ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm five . Let's give five . "
D,Elicit,"Or more "
D,Minor,"or "
B,Task,"Maybe you can buy separate ones "
D,Minor,"And um uh "
B,Minor,"and uh "
D,Task,"uh buy the product . You buy comm you get one . And uh basic . "
D,Task,"Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Um "
B,Minor,"I think "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"That's your choice comm I think huh . "
C,Minor,"tha that will be "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? "
A,Elicit,"Is that is that a good good opportunity ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"you could put it like that comm "
C,Task,"so top down . "
A,Task,"okay . "
C,Elicit,"Hmm ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station . "
C,Elicit,"Do we have to design that w as well ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh I'm not sure . "
C,Elicit,"The docking station ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
C,Other,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"we can b "
B,Task,"But th Yeah comm that can be very simple . Least . "
D,Task,"It c it could be just just a square comm just a packet . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"just a recharger . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Other,"just where you're around something . "
B,Minor,"Li "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"we had one example . "
C,Task,"But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . "
B,Other,"Mm . Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"but that's a round one . "
B,Minor,"Which w "
D,Task,"Maybe we can choose then . "
B,Task,"Here you see one that's very round . "
C,Task,"Oh yeah comm okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"I think that can be all kind of shapes . "
A,Task,"But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . "
C,Elicit,"Of the remote control ? "
A,Task,"That's all . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Just round it up . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm so "
B,Elicit,"y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod . "
B,Elicit,"But "
A,Task,"No . "
B,Elicit,"More rounded . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I think it will just look like more like this one . "
B,Minor,"Since it's "
B,Task,"This is also rounded . "
A,Task,"No comm "
B,Minor,"I think i "
A,Task,"just just the corners . "
B,Other,"Yeah okay comm "
B,Task,"tho those are al already a bit cornered . Mm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"but we can we can do all kinds of uh "
C,Task,"As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . "
A,Task,"Shapes . "
B,Other,"Yeah okay comm "
B,Task,"but then we have to think of something totally new . "
C,Task,"Not in depth . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but Yeah comm if if we want to make it kind of comm yeah comm new . "
B,Task,"I've uh I had a lot of picture of old ones . "
B,Task,"And all curves have already been done . "
A,Task,"It's a bit annoying comm "
A,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"What do we do wrong ? "
D,Task,"Hmm . Just just more like this and not uh a square . "
B,Task,"Yeah okay comm yeah well "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but we could do a lot of comm lot more curving . "
C,Task,"I would do it "
B,Task,"Yeah . I know we can do a lot more comm "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm it "
C,Task,"Like in this kind of shape "
C,Minor,"or "
D,Task,"Uh it's very annoying . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I dunno . I dunno if it's handy . "
B,Task,"I think it will only look more like the old remote controls . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Elicit,"This ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing . "
B,Task,"Yeah okay . "
B,Task,"But uh I had a lot of pictures "
B,Other,"Oh I can show you here what the old ones look like . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Curves comm curves . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You've more there as well . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"It wasn't very small one . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"very simple . "
B,Task,"That is for elderly . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we have to make a decision comm "
A,Elicit,"what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod comm and the same look . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So uh light or just whatever colour comm but the same light colours . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . "
B,Task,"No rubber buttons or something . "
B,Task,"Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And you have the scroll button inside . "
B,Task,"Yes . Just a simple scrollb "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? "
A,Minor,"Of "
A,Task,"Skip that one as well . "
B,Task,"Doesn't have to be . "
A,Task,"Okay . Yeah comm it's cool . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"though that's a trend . If we want to make it . "
C,Minor,"But yeah comm "
C,Task,"I'm not a Trendwatcher comm "
C,Task,"you are . "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Uh the t the trend is "
A,Task,"Rubber spongy . "
D,Task,"spongy and fruity . "
D,Other,"But yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . No . Spongy "
C,Task,"Spongeball kinda . "
B,Minor,"and "
D,Minor,"It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"we have s still one minute left . "
A,Minor,"So just "
D,Other,"Uh "
A,Task,"I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"It The th th "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff . "
A,Minor,"No . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But I I think it's still for older people . "
A,Task,"You j still have older people . "
A,Task,"It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that comm "
A,Minor,"like f "
A,Other,"Whatever . "
A,Minor,"Just you have a normal "
D,Minor,"There is one "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but we're we're aiming at a young public . "
D,Task,"There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original comm "
D,Task,"and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself . "
D,Task,"It must have uh uh uh a very different "
B,Other,"Yeah comm idea . "
B,Minor,"But you're "
B,Task,"If you look at the way remote controls are now "
D,Task,"Yeah comm they're all the same . "
B,Task,"And if you make it look like the iPod "
A,Task,"But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy . "
B,Task,"Yeah okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"that's already a very big change "
A,Task,"Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction . "
B,Minor,"compared to "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Ye yeah . Well uh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we could do that . "
B,Task,"Could . "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah comm "
D,Task,"but uh if you the f uh front comm the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"I think Oh . "
A,Task,"It's right . "
B,Task,"Think the scroll wheel won't be very big . "
B,Task,"Since if you put it uh somewhere comm the chances that it will scroll are too big . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So it will just be a small "
B,Task,"small scroll wheel . "
B,Task,"So it won't uh stick out much . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . "
A,Task,"Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this . "
A,Task,"Because it doesn't work properly . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"So maybe you have to ask her . "
B,Minor,"Yeah okay . Well comm "
B,Task,"maybe we can just open images there comm "
B,Other,"and I'll paint and paint . "
A,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
B,Other,"I'll be able to do a better job . "
A,Minor,"That's probably "
D,Task,"If you set the pen yeah comm he will draw here . "
D,Task,"Doesn't work . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Other,"just finish it . "
A,Task,"So we make it a bit like m that one probably . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I'll see it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Is that okay ? "
B,Minor,"Bu "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I agree more like iPod . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"only the colour and the flashy light "
A,Minor,"and the "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Just a "
A,Task,"We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . "
B,Task,"Speech . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"do we s keep that ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think "
A,Other,"Or keep that ? "
A,Task,"It's okay . "
A,Task,"But you'd definitely need a "
C,Minor,"S "
B,Minor,"Well uh "
C,Minor,"Uh yeah comm "
B,Minor,"then it w "
A,Task,"advanced chip . "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
C,Task,"And we we have to build in a microphone "
C,Minor,"and "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"that's very easy . "
B,Task,"We already have uh the beeping of the home station comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"and I do I don't know anything about that . "
B,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition comm "
D,Minor,"No . "
B,Task,"Uh strange that I received the information about that . "
C,Minor,"so "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"that's hard . "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said . We have to be original and uh technological innovative . "
D,Minor,"Becau "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well comm "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Elicit,"okay ? "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"shall we it open then ? "
D,Minor,"Ma "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So we can put all the "
A,Task,"The function of that in there . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"And we need a "
C,Task,"Fine . "
A,Task,"Probably we need a uh advanced chip then . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we probably do . "
A,Task,"But it doesn't say anything about it comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"does it ? "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"Oh yeah comm "
D,Task,"But we don't have any f information about the cost . "
B,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Minor,"We started with information about the cost was now th "
B,Minor,"I just I just received the "
C,Task,"Yeah comm uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"And how much is the chip ? "
D,Minor,"The the the "
C,Task,"I don't know how much comm "
C,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"our division has developed a new speech recognition feature comm the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . "
C,Minor,"Just in inexpensive or "
B,Task,"This is a very small electronic unit comm "
B,Task,"will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . "
D,Elicit,"And how how does it work ? "
D,Minor,"Is it "
B,Task,"Doesn't say . "
B,Task,"Just You say record comm followed by your question sample comm and after a few seconds the answer uh sample . "
B,Minor,"Because "
B,Minor,"uh So "
B,Task,"it works like uh good morning remote control comm "
B,Task,"and then the remote control says good morning . "
A,Task,"It doesn't has to say anything . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Just You have to just talk to "
D,Elicit,"Does it say does it say something back ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah uh "
B,Minor,"th that's just It's a "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we have to stop it now . "
A,Minor,"So just "
B,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"it "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"that's integrated in the chip comm "
B,Task,"so if you use the speech recognition comm that's in it . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"that's a r That's that's a advanced "
C,Elicit,"But i it's a separate chip . "
B,Task,"I dunno comm "
B,Task,"but if we use speech recognition comm that will be in it as well . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I don't know anything about this comm "
D,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"but Nah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"we just decide not to put it in comm "
A,Task,"because it's too difficult . "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"it it would be would be a good feature feature . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we just put it in comm "
A,Task,"because it's a good feature . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"No no worries about the cost comm etcetera . "
A,Task,"We have to stop now . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Minor,"And there's a chip in it that will "
A,Minor,"just "
A,Task,"We have to stop it now . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Fine . "
