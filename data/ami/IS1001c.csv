A,Elicit,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"So we are here for the concept design meeting . "
A,Task,"So comm we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . "
A,Task,"Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . "
A,Task,"So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . "
A,Task,"We'll then t take decision in concert "
A,Task,"and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task comm to have to be done before the next meeting . "
A,Task,"So comm last time we decided to have a simple interface . "
A,Task,"We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . "
A,Task,"Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . "
A,Task,"We have also button for volume comm and to switch on off the T_V_ . "
A,Task,"We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find comm "
A,Task,"and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . "
A,Task,"So now uh we will have three presentations . "
A,Task,"So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer comm "
A,Task,"the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ "
C,Task,"Abdul al-Hasred is my name . "
A,Other,"okay . "
A,Task,"And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert . "
A,Task,"So maybe we can start with uh industrial design . "
A,Task,"So this is the presentation . "
B,Elicit,"Uh comm I_D_ you want ? "
A,Other,"Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I only v have three slides comm so . "
B,Task,"I just look at the mm um just this . On some web pages to find some documentation "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and I think a remote control is comm as I s mentioned previously comm "
B,Task,"you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button "
B,Task,"and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . "
B,Task,"So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip comm which is uh very very standard comm and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . "
B,Minor,"And um "
B,Task,"yeah we can change directly . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . "
B,Task,"The push button are usually extremely cheap comm "
B,Task,"but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor comm which seems to be quite expensive . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"I I th "
A,Elicit,"So will will will this with uh including all possible things comm so buttons comm wheel and the chip comm be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ? "
B,Minor,"But I don't think that uh we should "
B,Task,"We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay "
C,Other,"Also have to say "
B,Minor,"But "
C,Elicit,"Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? "
B,Minor,"Um that's all "
C,Elicit,"No ? "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Elicit,"You received something "
B,Task,"I haven't chec "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed . "
A,Task,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Says "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . "
C,Minor,"But I guess it could be "
A,Elicit,"And could it be adapted ? "
C,Task,"I guess it's possible . "
C,Task,"I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command . "
A,Elicit,"Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ? "
C,Task,"Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff comm "
C,Task,"so if they already have it as uh as a chip "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"then we we could use it . "
A,Task,"Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"but I think it's yeah "
B,Other,"Sorry comm "
B,Task,"I haven't written my personal references . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button comm "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"and if we could reduce that . "
B,Task,"We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"I have a question about that actually . "
C,Elicit,"Um comm what is the purpose of the light ? "
B,Task,"Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber "
C,Minor,"Is "
A,Task,"You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? "
C,Minor,"But "
C,Minor,"But in th in the dark uh "
C,Elicit,"Yeah but is going to be always turned on comm the light ? "
A,Task,"It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think comm "
A,Elicit,"no ? "
C,Task,"But if you move it then you have it comm you don't need to find it . "
A,Task,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"You can see the buttons better comm of course . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . True . "
B,Other,"Yeah . Actually . "
C,Task,"But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . "
B,Task,"As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"but you need another sensor for that comm right ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . Again . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Elicit,"no it's too expensive . "
B,Task,"I don't think that this is really expensive comm "
B,Task,"but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Extra . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so comm "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light "
B,Task,"and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control comm when you want to turn off your device "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"But it can be uh battery consuming comm no ? "
A,Elicit,"To have the light always on ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm a little bit . "
B,Task,"A little bit . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Well we will discuss that after maybe "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay "
A,Task,"the other presentations . "
C,Task,". So uh my one comm it uh should be in the shared folder . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So . "
C,Task,"It was last time I saw it . "
A,Task,"And it is . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"just move to the next slide . "
C,Elicit,"So basically want very simple comm right ? "
C,Task,"That's the major idea comm as simple as possible . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Task,"So I just look at some current designs uh on the web comm of usually more complicated remote controls . "
C,Task,"And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . "
C,Task,"And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Um . So . "
A,Elicit,"And also does it uh fit well in hand ? "
A,Task,"Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Well this these uh these remotes are quite big comm "
C,Task,"so go to the next page comm "
C,Minor,"so . "
C,Task,"We have all these buttons as you can see comm but most of them comm we just need the ones in the middle . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So comm from the bottom or whatever is there comm uh the uh the numbers and then the top comm uh until the ten also comm this middle part comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and on the left one is exactly the same . "
C,Task,"So it's basically more or less how we would like it comm with a big volume control comm big channel control comm and mute and power comm "
C,Elicit,"yeah ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"These are the basic thing . "
A,Other,"So it's only the central part . "
C,Task,"So basically comm w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"if you have comm for example "
C,Task,"I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . "
C,Task,"It could be on the right side comm for example . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . "
C,Task,"And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"you open it comm it can break comm you ca you can do various things . "
C,Task,"Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . "
A,Minor,"Okay . S "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So that they're separate a bit comm "
A,Minor,"Will be down or "
C,Elicit,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons comm but uh comm it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Alright comm you won't yeah . "
C,Task,"Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with comm like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That you want to protect a bit . "
C,Task,"And I think it's uh it's reasonable . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So comm I don't think "
C,Task,"Yeah comm this is just the the wheel . "
C,Minor,"We could use the "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"some wheels can be pushed down comm could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel "
C,Task,"and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . "
A,Task,"So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect . "
B,Minor,"To s "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So we can move to the "
A,Elicit,"Is there any question ? "
A,Elicit,"For designer of user interface ? "
A,Task,"or we can move to the next part comm maybe comm and discuss afterwards ? "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Okay comm I can go ? "
D,Elicit,"Can I ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . "
D,Task,"So comm the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . "
D,Task,"And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . "
D,Task,"So comm are things we are we have uh speak about before . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And um so you you can go "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"after . "
D,Task,"And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends comm "
D,Task,"uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes comm shoes comm and furnitures . "
D,Task,"So comm maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form "
D,Task,"something like that comm or "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I support an apple . "
D,Task,"And the mm the material is expected to be spongy . "
D,Task,"Uh I don't know which material can be spongy comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"and if you "
A,Minor,"This is good also for "
C,Minor,"Well comm wou wou "
C,Task,"I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing comm "
C,Elicit,"it it would work comm right ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it is good also f to have a spongy material comm yeah . "
C,Task,"You can throw it to the television . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm because it's robust . "
D,Minor,"Okay "
B,Task,"Yeah . Me too . "
D,Task,"It's robust comm yeah . "
C,Other,"Hey "
C,Task,"that's a cool one . "
C,Task,"We could say that if you throw it comm you have a sensor comm and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . "
C,Task,"When it d uh takes a shock . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Other,"uh sorry ? "
B,Minor,"Ah it's okay . "
D,Task,"Not good . "
B,Task,"I know that they do that for alarm clock also . "
D,Minor,"An and and uh this uh you can "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah you can say that . "
D,Task,"You ca uh you can go uh before "
A,Elicit,"No . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Before ? "
D,Task,"comm before comm yes "
D,Task,". And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel comm after is uh technological innovative comm and after the easy to use . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah that's why "
D,Task,"Yeah "
A,Elicit,"Has it ? "
D,Task,"that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Innovative . Mm . "
A,Task,"So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept . "
C,Elicit,"How do we make it look cool is the question . "
A,Elicit,"Cool comm fancy ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh comm things like that . "
B,Minor,"What about um "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Oh comm colour comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Well the obvious thing is a banana comm I guess . "
D,Minor,"Oh i i "
A,Task,"Maybe yeah . "
D,Task,"I thought about a a pear comm for example . "
D,Task,"You know the pear comm is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and it's ergonomic as well . "
D,Minor,"and uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"A pear . "
C,Task,"The banana is also ergonomic . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that . "
D,Task,"Or a fruit like that . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We can discuss that uh . "
A,Elicit,"D D Is is there anything you want to add ? "
C,Elicit,"Is there any fruit that is spongy ? "
A,Task,"I don't think so . "
A,Task,"I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good comm fit well comm or banana as you told . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And for maybe look and feel comm what about a a piece of ice comm "
A,Task,"Something like that . "
B,Task,"with blue L_E_D_ inside ? "
A,Task,"But that's not in the trend . . "
C,Minor,"You can make it um "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"The trend is spongy comm and vegetable fruits . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"It's not hard comm the metal . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . "
C,Task,"Plastic . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"I think we can keep the wheel "
A,Task,"because it's uh easy comm it's innovative comm even if the cost is a bit higher comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and we also have to find a comm so comm a fruit like pear or banana "
A,Elicit,"wit uh any others idea you have . "
A,Elicit,"What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? "
C,Task,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Odi "
B,Task,"Banana I think comm "
B,Task,"it's a nice idea . "
A,Task,"Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then . "
B,Minor,"Because "
B,Minor,"But "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that comm "
C,Task,"Two of the button comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"but when the banana is curving like that comm with the wheel on the top and to control comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and here you have a a push button to "
D,Minor,"But you don't have "
A,Task,"I think it's a good idea comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve comm "
C,Elicit,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So you can have it on on two sides "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and it'll be cool comm "
C,Elicit,"no ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . "
A,Task,"Maybe we can keep the banana . "
A,Task,"And it will be very easy to find . "
C,Task,"You can put also vibrator inside . "
B,Task,"And everybody knows what is a banana . "
B,Other,"Basically . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha "
C,Other,"Ah-ha . "
C,Task,"You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . "
B,Task,"Oh comm yeah "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah it's really uh really a good point . "
C,Other,"I hope the students of management die comm "
C,Other,"but anyway . "
C,Elicit,"Now who are recording this meeting ? "
A,Minor,"I think it "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"One second . "
A,Task,"So we have to take some decision on this aspect . "
A,Minor,"So comm uh so for "
A,Other,"sorry comm "
A,Task,"for uh component comm "
A,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we have to think about those aspects comm "
A,Other,"sorry . "
B,Elicit,"So we will just use a a standard battery ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"And uh the chip we "
B,Task,"chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . "
B,Elicit,"Uh what do you mean by case ? "
A,Task,"I think it's the box that should be spongy comm banana's shape . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case comm doesn't matter . "
B,Task,"I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box comm and that's it . "
C,Minor,"The only th "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . "
B,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be "
C,Minor,"I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to "
B,Task,"Spongy also . "
C,Task,"I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move comm "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Task,"So comm it's going to be bend a lot . "
C,Minor,"So if we try to push the buttons comm it "
B,Task,"Oh no I think it's possible . "
A,Minor,"But "
C,Elicit,"You think it's possible ? "
A,Minor,"No the button would be "
A,Task,"In fact it it should be something odd shaped comm with a spongy cover . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,". This is uh like the "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,"odd shape with spongy cover . "
A,Task,"And standard battery okay comm "
A,Task,"a chip imprint comm there's no specific problem . "
A,Task,"So we agree to put the wheel "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Wheel on the top . "
B,Elicit,"Button comm where do we want some buttons ? "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Minor,"usually hold "
C,Task,"'Kay comm we want it to be good also for the left-hand users comm "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"So it have to it has to be symmetrical . "
C,Task,"Yeah but "
C,Minor,"okay . "
C,Minor,"Sa let's say that th o "
C,Minor,"It has to be "
C,Task,"basically you can only take two sides comm "
C,Task,"one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Other,"Basically . "
C,Task,"Or you could use use this one comm "
C,Task,"but I don't know if it's very comfortable comm to use this one for the wheel . "
A,Task,"Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable . "
C,Task,"This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? "
A,Task,"Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . Mm . "
C,Task,"Should have the two sides . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"So if the left comm we have "
C,Minor,"the op "
A,Task,"I think you can turn it this way also . "
A,Task,"You can do both with both hands . "
C,Minor,"Wheel "
C,Task,"Wheel buttons . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around comm the buttons are on the other side . "
A,Task,"I think it's okay . "
C,Task,"So you cannot see them . "
A,Task,"Well comm you you will get used to it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And moreover comm th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side comm because you have light on buttons . "
C,Task,"So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be "
C,Minor,"Y "
C,Task,"Yeah I know comm "
C,Task,"but uh if you hold with your left hand comm and the wheel is here comm and the buttons are here comm then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No "
A,Minor,"you you "
A,Task,"I think you will use it only on the right or left hand comm whether you are righty or lefty . "
A,Task,"I think for lefty it's okay . "
A,Task,"I can do this movement comm "
A,Task,"and for righty as well . "
A,Task,"I think this doesn't change that much . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Maybe . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side . "
A,Minor,"And "
A,Task,"and uh a wheel on the top . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So the colour is yellow . "
A,Minor,"I think it's uh "
A,Task,"we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"So maybe we can um "
A,Task,"we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . "
A,Task,"So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . "
A,Task,"And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product . "
A,Task,"That is to say comm uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users comm "
A,Task,"but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . "
A,Task,"It seems to be fancy comm innovative comm and easy to use . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together . "
A,Task,"That would uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"be better comm I think . "
A,Minor,"And uh "
A,Minor,"And so uh "
A,Task,"you will receive further instruction by emails comm as usual . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Other,"Yes master . "
A,Elicit,"do you need to add anything ? "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"You feel okay ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"You feel uh free to express what you want to say ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"You don't feel too constrained ? "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Other,"You don't feel free to answer this ? "
C,Minor,"Maybe you can make "
C,Minor,"uh uh mm "
C,Other,"okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Other,"See you . "
