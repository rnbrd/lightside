A,Minor,"Okay . Uh "
A,Other,"good afternoon . "
D,Other,"Good afternoon . "
A,Task,"This is our third meeting already . "
A,Other,"I hope you enjoyed your lunch . "
A,Task,"I did anyway . "
A,Minor,"Um let's see . "
A,Other,"Presentation three . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Task,"this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . "
A,Task,"It's the conceptual design meeting . "
A,Task,"And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . "
A,Task,"Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations "
A,Task,"you're going to show me in a few minutes . "
A,Other,"Um but first I'll show you the agenda . "
A,Task,"Uh first the opening . "
A,Task,"Then we have three presentations . "
A,Task,"Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . "
A,Task,"How we're going to make it . "
A,Task,"And then we're closing . "
A,Task,"We have about forty minutes . "
A,Task,"Uh so I suggest let's get started . "
A,Elicit,"Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? "
A,Elicit,"No ? "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"Everything fine ? "
A,Task,"That's nice . "
A,Other,"Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . "
A,Task,"Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . "
A,Task,"Uh requirements are uh teletext comm docking station comm audio signal comm small screen comm with some extras that uh button information . "
A,Task,"And we are going to use default materials . "
A,Elicit,"Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? "
A,Elicit,"No ? "
A,Task,"These are just the the things we thought of comm "
A,Task,"so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else comm just let me know . "
A,Unlab,"And maybe we can uh work it out . "
A,Task,"And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"now everybody knows what we're do we're doing comm "
A,Task,"um I suggest let's get started with the presentations . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ? "
D,Task,"Sure . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Other,"I'll start off then . "
A,Other,"Good luck . "
D,Other,"Doh . "
D,Minor,"'Kay "
D,Other,"I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . "
D,Task,"Um we've done some market research . "
D,Task,"We distributed some more enquetes comm questionnaires . "
D,Task,"And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . "
D,Task,"And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers comm after the original trend-watchers return comm about what the the best design would be . "
D,Minor,"Um okay "
D,Task,"these are some overall findings . "
D,Task,"Um most important thing is the fancy design . "
D,Task,"Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . "
D,Task,"Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . "
D,Task,"By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . "
D,Task,"Um about half of comm half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . "
D,Task,"Um for our um group comm we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old comm this is um comm these factors are slightly more equal . "
D,Minor,"'Kay "
D,Task,"these are some more group specific findings . "
D,Task,"Uh the older people prefer dark colours . "
D,Task,"Uh they like recognisable shapes comm and familiar material . "
D,Task,"And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . "
D,Task,"Um this is comm this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . "
D,Other,"Um this leads us to some personal preferences . "
D,Task,"Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . "
D,Task,"Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . "
D,Task,"Just keep it simple "
D,Minor,"and "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest comm "
D,Task,"because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . "
D,Task,"So this would be very important that we at least include these features . "
D,Task,"Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be comm the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . "
D,Task,"So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . "
D,Minor,"This is not really "
D,Task,"This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . "
D,Task,"So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . "
D,Task,"So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . "
D,Task,"Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions comm one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel comm and one with a grey-black colour . "
D,Task,"The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . "
D,Task,"Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . "
D,Task,"That would be all . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Elicit,"Any questions about the the trends ? "
D,Elicit,"Any questions ? "
A,Minor,"Mayb "
B,Other,"Mm no . "
A,Elicit,"No ? "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we go on to the next one . "
B,Minor,"Um 'kay um yeah . "
B,Task,"uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . "
B,Task,"Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . "
B,Minor,"So uh um uh "
B,Task,"that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um "
B,Task,"Uh and uh using a little uh display . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"findings . "
B,Minor,"Um yeah "
B,Task,"just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"only uh buttons uh for uh sound comm um for uh on-off comm um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . "
B,Minor,"Um uh let's see . Um yeah and Uh "
B,Task,"we uh need some uh new a attractive functions "
B,Task,"uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . "
B,Task,"Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . "
B,Minor,"Um and yeah "
B,Task,"overall um user-friendly . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"using uh large large buttons . Um "
B,Task,"It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . "
B,Task,"Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control comm you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . "
B,Minor,"So uh uh yeah . "
B,Task,"And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something comm you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off "
B,Minor,"or A and "
B,Minor,"uh yeah . "
B,Task,"Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um "
B,Minor,"Let's see . Uh yeah . "
B,Task,"I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles comm "
B,Task,"um just one button to keep it uh simple . "
B,Task,"Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . "
B,Task,"Um double push push um comm if double click comm um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles comm for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . "
B,Minor,"So uh Um Yeah "
B,Task,"and w we have to keep uh in general buttons "
B,Minor,"uh so um "
B,Task,"we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off comm sound on-off comm sound higher or lower comm um the numbers comm uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . "
B,Task,"Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . "
B,Task,"And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"made a little uh picture of uh it . "
B,Minor,"Um See . Um yeah . "
B,Task,"Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner comm "
B,Task,"um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . "
B,Task,"Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"D display uh of it comm it's uh just a small display . "
B,Task,"Uh um you can put it uh on top . "
B,Task,"Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh comm most of looks at . "
B,Minor,"So uh um "
B,Task,"and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel comm um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the "
B,Task,"So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . "
B,Task,"Um it's uh quite uh handy place . "
B,Minor,"So um and uh "
B,Task,"all the f functions for subtitle uh one button comm uh for sound uh "
B,Task,"Uh and uh for our design comm um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it "
B,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"And that's it . "
A,Other,"Uh thank you . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"About the components design . "
C,Task,"Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery "
C,Task,"or comm a as an optional thing comm a kinetic energy comm like in a watch comm "
C,Task,"which you just shake and it produces energy . "
C,Task,"But if we choose for that option comm the docking station would c become obsolete . "
C,Task,"So I don't think it's really an option . "
C,Task,"Uh for the casing comm uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing comm single or double curved casing . "
C,Task,"It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . "
C,Task,"It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . "
C,Task,"Uh as a case supplement comm we could um comm I thought of that l later comm uh a rubber uh belt comm like a anti-slip . "
C,Task,"Uh for the b buttons comm we can use plastic or rubber . "
C,Task,"And the chip-set comm um it says simple here comm "
C,Task,"but it should be advanced comm "
C,Task,"because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . "
C,Task,"And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed comm um people like wood comm "
C,Task,"but it raises the price "
C,Task,"and it doesn't really fit the image comm unless we would start two product lines . "
C,Task,"Form should follow function overall . "
C,Task,"Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . "
C,Task,"But depends on what we want . "
C,Task,"I think we should disc discuss that . "
C,Task,"Um for the case comm uh the supplement and the buttons comm it really depends on the designer . "
C,Task,"And the chip-set uh really should be advanced "
C,Task,"because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . "
C,Task,"And that's it . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . "
A,Other,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . So "
A,Task,"these are the points we have to discuss . "
A,Task,"Um first I think we can talk about the energy source comm "
A,Task,"since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price comm uh and image . "
A,Minor,"Uh so "
A,Elicit,"uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget comm I think . "
C,Minor,"Yes "
C,Minor,"w "
C,Task,"there there are four options . "
C,Task,"We could use the basic normal battery . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh a hand dynamo . "
C,Task,"But I don't think that's really an option . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh solar cells . "
C,Task,"But not every room is very light "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"so it's not a very good option . "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Or the kinetic energy . "
A,Other,"Yeah . Okay . "
D,Elicit,"And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"You just "
C,Task,"y you basically shake your remote comm and then it powers up . "
D,Task,"You use it and it works . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Nah . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . That's true . "
D,Task,"And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . "
C,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Task,"And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um "
D,Task,"get great popularity for our product . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But "
D,Minor,"Um wel "
B,Elicit,"what's the function ? "
B,Task,"Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries "
B,Minor,". "
D,Task,"Yeah "
D,Task,"you could load up the batteries comm "
B,Minor,"B b "
D,Task,"you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . "
B,Other,"Okay "
B,Task,"but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . "
B,Task,"Uh it's uh just a small display "
B,Task,"so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . "
B,Task,"So I believe one battery uh is just enough . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"Uh so "
A,Minor,"Uh well "
A,Task,"I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . "
D,Task,"That's true . "
A,Task,"And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . "
B,Task,"Yeah . That's true . Yeah . "
A,Task,"And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . "
A,Task,"So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push comm and then it starts beeping . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And then we can we can still use the voice recognition comm but maybe then for only the the channels . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"That's safe . "
D,Elicit,"I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's a good point . "
C,Task,"Mm I don't have any information on pricing . "
C,Other,"So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"'Cause in our earlier um market research comm "
D,Elicit,"if you'd allow me to go to the flat board comm SMARTboard . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm sure . Go ahead . "
D,Minor,"Um so "
D,Task,"it was open here . "
D,Task,"Um we also um asked if w they would comm if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"you can see here comm our target group would not do that . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"I would greatly advise not to do it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product comm that is meant for the "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"younger people . "
C,Task,"But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Task,"It's a bit higher percentage comm "
C,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Um well "
D,Minor,"this is "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"but this is "
D,Task,"here the question was comm would you prefer it . "
D,Task,"So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . "
D,Task,"And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Easier to use ? "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"I think that's a good point . "
B,Elicit,"But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display comm or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ? "
D,Minor,"Um well "
D,Task,"this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"So pretty large . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use comm with the extra information comm I think nobody has anything against it . "
A,Task,"Because it's just uh some extra information comm "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"and it's easy to ignore as well . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it . "
A,Minor,"And um yeah "
A,Minor,"I think the um "
A,Task,"Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . "
A,Task,"Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . "
A,Task,"And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use comm as well . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"that brings us back to the energy . "
A,Task,"If we don't have the voice recognition comm it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"in that case we could use kinetic uh energy comm "
A,Task,"but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . "
A,Task,"And much cheaper as well . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"And that's the best choice . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Other,"let me just choose for the battery . "
A,Task,"That brings us to the chip . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"there isn't any choice there "
C,Task,"because we're using the the the the display . "
A,Task,"Just the advanced . "
C,Task,"So it's gotta be advanced . "
A,Other,"Okay "
D,Other,"'Kay . "
A,Other,"comm advanced chip . "
A,Task,"And then we get to the point of the case . "
A,Task,"Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . "
A,Elicit,"Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? "
A,Minor,"Um as we saw there is not "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"wood is a lot more expensive to produce . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive comm "
A,Task,"which they can show off to their grandkids . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Look I've got a new remote control comm and uh "
D,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"Uh I dunno . "
D,Task,"And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . "
D,Task,"So it wouldn't actually have to be wood comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's right . "
D,Task,"if it's just "
D,Task,"wood-coloured . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ? "
C,Task,"Mm I dunno . "
A,Other,"You don't know ? "
C,Other,"I'll have to uh research . "
A,Task,"I think so "
A,Minor,"because "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Probably . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . "
B,Elicit,"Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . "
B,Minor,"So um uh "
B,Minor,"you 'cause "
B,Minor,"uh Yeah "
B,Task,"with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones comm uh when you can change the case of it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Change the cases . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"maybe it's possible uh possibility . "
B,Minor,"So um um "
B,Task,"you have just to make one um standard um remote control comm "
B,Task,"and um yeah you can sell uh few uh "
A,Task,"You can sell the cases . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think that's a very good option . "
A,Task,"Because um then you can advertise as well "
A,Minor,"with the "
A,Task,"Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control comm or whatever . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Because that's a it's something extra comm "
A,Task,"it's something other remotes don't have comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"which we can get a great advantage point . "
D,Task,"Yeah that is true . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey comm other colours as well . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"We would have to look carefully into the design though . "
A,Task,"Costs . "
D,Task,"'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . The more original one comm or the more standard one . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . So "
D,Minor,"So that would "
A,Elicit,"you suggest we should design two different telephones "
A,Elicit,"on which you can apply comm yeah remote controls comm on which you can apply different case covers comm for example . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"I wouldn't design a telephone "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"no "
D,Task,"I think w we should just comm we should then just design one um "
A,Task,"Remote . "
D,Task,"one remote comm "
D,Task,"but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Task,"but that shouldn't be too much of a problem . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"everybody's okay with the changing covers ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"I think that's a good uh good option . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Changing case covers . "
D,Task,"Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat comm single and double curved . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Could you explain that a little more ? "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"the the general like most older remotes are flat comm just straight . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . "
D,Elicit,"And what would single curved and double curved mean ? "
C,Task,"Um it would just only affect the form comm for as far as I know . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"we can pretty much just do whatever we want . "
C,Task,"Pick one you like comm "
C,Task,"yes . "
A,Other,"Mm . Okay . "
D,Other,"'Kay . "
D,Task,"That's good . "
A,Minor,"Uh but the form has to be um It has to "
A,Elicit,"It's has to be possible to stand up ? "
A,Elicit,"Or just only to lie down ? "
D,Task,"No "
D,Task,"just to lie down . "
B,Other,"okay . "
A,Elicit,"And the the cover of the the docking station is also "
D,Task,"We'll go for that . "
A,Elicit,"on top of the television then ? Or not ? "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"or besides it . "
A,Task,"And you can just yeah then click it in . "
A,Other,"That's okay . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Elicit,"the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ? "
A,Task,"Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"on the the board . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"Does somebody have ideas for a form "
A,Minor,"or "
B,Task,"Uh we can just use the regular form of it comm "
B,Task,"but it's um not quite uh fancy . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side comm "
D,Task,"so you could comm so your thumb would be easily "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well uh "
D,Task,"I think that was a very good point "
D,Task,"'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . "
D,Task,"So that would be great for that . "
D,Task,"Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . "
B,Minor,"For uh Uh for "
D,Task,"For left-handed users also . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"we "
B,Elicit,"Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting comm uh for for the sound ? "
D,Task,"For the volume . "
B,Elicit,"Or Or isn't it ? "
D,Minor,"Um well "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"that could "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"we could do that "
D,Task,"but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy comm ease of use . "
A,Minor,"Usabili "
A,Task,"Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult comm "
B,Other,"Yeah okay . "
A,Minor,"and then it's "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
D,Task,"But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides comm that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"But you have extra buttons . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So people can get confused . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That is true . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Especially if they have the same writings on it . "
B,Minor,"See um yeah . "
B,Task,"Or we have to make a left uh For lefties "
A,Elicit,"Can't we make uh Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same "
B,Minor,"and "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Elicit,"functions as the normal one ? "
B,Minor,"You mean um "
A,Minor,"Then you have to "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"if "
A,Minor,"Let's see if I ca "
A,Other,"A blank one . "
A,Minor,"And then you get "
A,Task,"Here's a little L_C_D_ screen . "
A,Other,"Uh now I have to think . "
A,Task,"It's a plus and a min . "
A,Task,"No it's not very handy I think . "
B,Task,"Mm no . "
A,Task,"Because the plus and the min will be opposite "
A,Minor,"and all kinds of "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"No that's not gonna work . I guess . "
A,Minor,"Maybe we should "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? "
A,Task,"I think the functions are "
A,Task,"that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel "
D,Task,"Yeah . That is true . "
A,Minor,"or "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"It's just uh u using uh your thumb . "
A,Task,"Y yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Minor,"it's "
A,Task,"I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"I think we should start by by choosing a case . "
C,Task,"Because that's the basis you're building on . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um yeah "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Other,"I could draw them out . "
A,Minor,"just "
C,Task,"Let's look at the flat case . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"It's from the side "
C,Task,"so it's rather normal . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like comm but I think it's something like this . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"this type should be better for you "
C,Task,"or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . "
A,Elicit,"Easier ? "
C,Task,"And the double curved s looks something like this I guess . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"th those are the three options we have . "
A,Other,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I suggest um the single curved comm "
A,Task,"because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . "
A,Task,"Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control "
A,Task,"and at the same time look easily at the screen comm "
A,Task,"because it's a bit comm it has a bit of a angle . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Minor,"Do you say this "
B,Minor,"um S uh Uh "
B,Elicit,"you got like uh sort of a I believe There ? "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Elicit,"you want to put a display over here ? Or not ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . I think so . Yeah . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um Yeah . Uh "
A,Minor,"But now it's "
B,Minor,"we can make it um "
A,Elicit,"Do you have it upside down "
A,Minor,"or "
B,Other,"Mm ? "
A,Elicit,"Do you have it "
B,Task,"That's the top . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
A,Other,"this that's top ? Okay . "
B,Task,"this top . "
B,Task,"This down . "
B,Minor,"Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like "
B,Minor,"um Let's see . Um "
B,Other,"Colour uh "
B,Task,"okay . "
B,Task,"Uh to make this side um like mm the right colour . "
B,Task,"Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Minor,"Uh it's an "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So so "
B,Task,"the remote control have to um lay in your hand . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Minor,"it's possib um yeah for s so and "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"get your mouse . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's a good one . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top . "
B,Minor,"Uh rem "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around "
A,Task,"then you get here . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"but this place um "
A,Task,"If you can have this one comm you turn it like this . "
A,Task,"And then flip it upside down . "
B,Minor,"Uh it's "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
B,Task,"I dunno um "
A,Task,"Because uh maybe your hand is in the way comm if you have the display here . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"It's more logical to have it on top as well "
C,Task,"because comm like on your mobile phone comm it's always above . "
A,Minor,"I think i "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"On top . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Oh "
C,Task,"maybe you should just s start on a blank page . "
A,Minor,". So "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"then we get "
A,Minor,"Here's "
A,Task,"That's the curve . "
B,Task,"Five minutes . "
A,Task,"Here the display comm and then buttons . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Task,"and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . "
A,Task,"Just that's for left hand and right hand users . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"And then h the rest of the buttons over here . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"But um the on-off button comm um still on the top uh "
A,Task,"Yeah still here "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"jus "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"That's "
D,Task,"And I'd prefer the corners to be round . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . 'Kay . "
D,Task,"Think that would be better . "
A,Task,"Should be more bit more friendly comm "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Friendly on the eye . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"Supplements . That's okay . "
A,Other,"Where's my mouse ? "
A,Task,"Then We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . "
A,Minor,"So now "
A,Task,"for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . "
A,Task,"It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . "
A,Task,"So check out the corporate website maybe . "
A,Task,"The user interface design comm it's the same story . "
A,Task,"And product evaluation . "
A,Task,"So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . "
A,Task,"But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And then we're going to uh try to finish our project comm "
A,Task,"and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers comm I think . "
A,Minor,"Which are "
A,Minor,"Uh let's see . "
A,Task,"I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together "
A,Minor,"or "
A,Task,"I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And then you'll get a message . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"that's uh basically it . "
A,Other,"Maybe this one ? "
A,Other,"Then we can save this one in the folders group . "
A,Task,"Uh yes comm it's here . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"SMARTboard comm there it it . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"if you wanna have a look at it comm it's over there in the projects folder . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Other,"Very good . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
