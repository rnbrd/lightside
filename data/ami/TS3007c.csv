A,Other,"Hello again . "
C,Other,"Hi . "
B,Other,"Hello . "
D,Other,"Hey comm Project Manager . "
B,Other,"Um comm Project Manager comm I have something to tell you . "
A,Task,"Mm yeah . "
B,Task,"I have a little problems with my laptop . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"No comm a little problem comm uh big problem . "
B,Minor,"I just thought "
D,Elicit,"What was it comm problem ? "
B,Task,"Um comm it didn't work anymore . "
D,Elicit,"The laptop ? "
B,Task,"The entire Windows uh "
D,Task,"It hang hung . "
B,Task,"It it hung . "
D,Other,"Ha-ha . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"Project Manager . "
A,Other,"Yes . "
D,Other,"You're our Project Manager . "
A,Task,"Yes . "
A,Other,"Your project manager . "
A,Task,"Welcome to the conceptual design meeting "
A,Task,"for Real Reaction . "
A,Other,"Uh comm hello again . "
A,Task,"Uh it's uh the same as the last time . "
A,Task,"Uh uh comm also this time there will be uh three presentations . "
A,Task,"And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts . "
A,Other,"Um uh comm and at the end comm uh I uh comm when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh visited . information . "
B,Other,"During lunch comm yeah . "
D,Other,"Master . "
B,Other,"He's the master comm yeah . "
D,Other,"Master of "
A,Task,"The the the the the concepts on uh we uh where we uh must reach a decision on . Um uh comm our from uh are of two sorts . "
A,Task,"Components concepts and user interface concepts . "
A,Task,"Uh comm the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh "
A,Task,"Well comm we have decided to do a do the uh with a touch-screen "
A,Task,"that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable . "
A,Task,"Uh how how about the energy ? "
A,Task,"Can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange ? "
A,Task,"Uh comm the user interface concept . Uh comm with the type and uh the the supplements . "
A,Task,"So uh where to put what button . "
A,Task,"And uh uh I would say uh Jans comm can you begin ? "
C,Other,"Yeah comm sure . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"At the end comm uh "
A,Other,"I will take notes "
A,Task,"uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Uh comm let me see . "
C,Task,"I think it's this one . "
C,Other,"Ha . "
B,Other,"Wow . "
C,Minor,"Right . Uh comm well comm "
C,Other,"I'll be talking about the components . "
C,Task,"Uh comm what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Uh below forty five and above . "
C,Task,"And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh comm well comm what what d do we want comm and how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group . "
C,Minor,"Well uh what I found was that a senior um "
C,Task,"senior citizens uh "
D,Other,"I'm sorry . "
C,Task,"Ye Ah comm it's it's okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . Go on . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"They comm well comm they like more the they like the traditional materials comm like wood and and such more . "
C,Task,"Wood and chrome . "
C,Task,"And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes . "
C,Task,"Um comm uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles comm "
C,Task,"where whereas the young and dynamic comm they like a more uh soft materials . "
C,Task,"Think of the Teletubbies comm for instance . "
C,Task,"Uh uh comm soft and fluffy and colourful and "
C,Task,"Well uh comm shapes are curved and round . "
C,Other,"Y y you get the picture . "
C,Task,"And uh they like sports and gaming comm and that gives them uh the vitality . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm so w well uh comm firs "
A,Other,"One one little question . "
A,Task,"Um about the the material . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Uh a soft material for a remote control ? "
C,Other,"No comm I'll I'll get to that . "
A,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
C,Task,"You you'll see . Yeah . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Task,"Uh comm well f first off comm let's start start with the energy . "
C,Task,"W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . "
C,Task,"Uh kinetic comm that's when you move something comm then uh it gets energy . "
C,Task,"I figured comm well that's ki kinda high-tech comm when when you have a remote control that well comm when you pick it up comm it has power . "
C,Task,"That would be actually very nice comm uh I figured . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"Well comm we could also use a battery comm "
C,Minor,"that's a bit "
D,Elicit,"Yeah but when the power gets low comm you have to shake it or something ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah yeah comm you c just you have to shake it around a little bit . "
D,Minor,"Uh comm and uh uh "
C,Task,"And then then it d then it has some more uh energy . "
C,Task,"Well comm y you could just go for a battery . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Or you can go for both ? "
B,Elicit,"Oh comm have you considered the option of using a solar panel ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I actually did . "
C,Task,"But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light . "
C,Task,"Well comm sunlight preferably . "
B,Minor,"W nah . "
C,Task,"Uh comm and you you could you could use normal light comm but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels comm you could actually use uh "
C,Task,"you could use uh solar panels comm but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control comm leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface . "
D,Task,"Mm yeah . It's too less space . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So uh "
C,Minor,"so i i it it wo what's actually I I c just in f "
C,Task,"I've figured it out that well comm uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of T_V_ comm and the from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light . "
C,Task,"So it would actually power itself uh from a T_V_ . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But comm well you just take up all the space comm "
C,Task,"and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"But you prefer kinetic ? "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"I I prefer kinetic because it's uh well comm the costs aren't that much higher comm and um comm ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"I mean comm if "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but you don't move a a remote control too much . "
C,Task,"No comm but uh d Well comm you pick it up and you press buttons and y well comm you "
A,Elicit,"And that's enough to to keep the energy level uh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm well uh actually it is . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"And it it "
C,Task,"if it isn't comm you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But comm what l what Jarek said comm you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . "
C,Task,"And for rest comm you'd just add juice on the battery . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And when the battery doesn't work comm I usually shake it too . So "
D,Task,"Like slamming on it . "
C,Task,"Exactly . "
D,Task,"It's exactly the same . "
C,Minor,"And so that Uh Uh well comm "
A,Other,"Thank you comm Tim . "
C,Task,"f furthermore comm you you we uh checked uh the cases . "
C,Task,"We have uh different options uh concerning the cases . "
C,Task,"You ha I you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh "
C,Task,"it was kind of square "
C,Task,"and uh I figured that's a bit boring . "
C,Minor,"So you you "
C,Task,"we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved . "
C,Task,"Um comm single curve comm it's just a well comm uh comm you know comm it's just uh a nice curve . "
C,Task,"Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's like several different dimensions . "
C,Task,"That gives you an whole new uh effec "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Dynamic dynamic look ? "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look comm I f I figured . "
C,Task,"But comm that uh we'll discuss later . "
D,Task,"But comm are you going to draw it ? "
C,Elicit,"What ? "
D,Minor,"The "
C,Elicit,"You want me to draw in three-D_ ? "
B,Task,"Th th yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh comm I c I can't imagine . "
C,Other,"Uh comm yeah comm I ca I ca I could I could show you . I could show you . "
D,Task,"I can't imagine how how how it looks like . "
C,Minor,"Well uh let's say y uh you uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Let's say that's your standard uh "
D,Task,"Design . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's a bit your d standard design . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But you could actually go like uh something like this . "
C,Task,"And then uh in three-D_ effect you could go "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"Uh "
C,Minor,"So y you you just "
C,Task,"Yeah comm this is a this bit uh difficulty in "
C,Task,"I didn't take a major in art . "
C,Minor,"So But "
C,Task,"but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth comm you could you could uh just play around a bit with . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"You you don't have to use standard uh "
D,Minor,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Task,"A little artistic . "
C,Task,"Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh that might be an idea comm "
C,Minor,"but just a "
C,Task,"Well comm furthermore comm uh well comm uh plastic versus rubber ? "
C,Task,"You We could choose uh what uh what's better comm plastic um or rubber . "
C,Task,"I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's soft . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's soft and it's that I like soft . "
A,Task,"That's the material the younger people want uh comm ain't it ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"yeah I mean uh plastic uh is "
C,Task,"Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it comm "
C,Minor,"like plastic uh Your your "
C,Task,"I usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap . "
C,Task,"Uh that's maybe just me comm "
C,Task,"but Uh comm we could uh "
C,Task,"uh comm oh comm talk about it later . "
C,Task,"Uh furthermore comm buttons . "
C,Task,"Uh traditional uh or a touch screen . "
C,Task,"Well comm we discussed it in a previous meeting comm so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ . "
C,Task,"And uh chip set comm "
C,Task,"well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons comm we could go uh with a simple chip set . "
C,Task,"But uh if we decide to go on a n uh um L_C_D_ screen comm we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set . "
C,Task,"And that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it . "
C,Task,"So that's something we th have to keep in mind . "
C,Task,"If it isn't uh manageable uh budget-wise comm we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons . "
D,Task,"Well comm I think uh we're going to sell tell ten millions of them . "
D,Task,"So uh I bet a big company in uh Korea or Taiwan comm like uh Samsung comm can give us uh a big discount on the chips comm so "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm probably . "
D,Task,"U usually comm chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm probably comm "
C,Minor,"but But uh yeah comm that's that's "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"That that shouldn't be a real issue comm I think . "
C,Task,"That shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue . "
C,Task,"I'll I'll I'll just add comm uh uh I put a big summary here comm so we could discuss it a bit . "
C,Elicit,"Uh what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ? "
B,Task,"Um comm I think you should use kinetic as a back-up . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm you you you should we should "
D,Task,"Yeah comm a combination . "
B,Task,"A combination comm yeah . "
C,Task,"A combination . "
C,Task,"Uh comm you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . "
C,Task,"When you pick it up comm it charges up . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Like an uh aku uh "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Acu uh comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah comm I know . "
B,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
A,Task,"Just like the watch from Seiko . "
D,Task,"Well comm . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Psycho-kinetic . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I con Exactly . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"What uh what do you think ? "
C,Elicit,"You agree ? "
A,Task,"I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah ? Both ? "
D,Task,"Combine them . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Combine them . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh comm well that would bring the m m some more costs comm "
C,Task,"but I mean the "
C,Task,"Who cares comm right . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"That's the Project Manager's problem . "
B,Other,"Buy a fifty cents battery and uh "
D,Other,"Of course . Fifty cent . "
C,Other,"Yeah comm well Fifty cent uh "
C,Minor,"Uh comm why doesn't "
C,Elicit,"And then we have single-curved versus double-curved . "
C,Minor,"That "
B,Task,"Well maybe I have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"No comm we'll we'll just wait and uh "
C,Elicit,"Uh comm plastic versus rubber . Any ideas ? "
D,Task,"Rubber . "
A,Task,"Rubber . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh comm rubber ? "
B,Elicit,"Um comm isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a . "
C,Minor,"You "
B,Minor,"Or do you think it "
C,Task,"Uh comm I figured it will be m rather than hard "
B,Task,"Rubber casing comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Rather hard . "
C,Task,"Nah comm rubber c uh this is a casing comm yeah . Rubber casing comm "
C,Task,"because well if you use an uh d a touch-screen comm uh it's just a casing uh around it . "
C,Task,"So um comm you could go for plastic comm but I figured "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Um comm well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have . "
C,Task,"I I I would choose rubber . "
B,Elicit,"Uh comm is it possible uh of is it necessary to make a touch-screen square ? "
B,Elicit,"It isn't comm I think comm yeah ? "
C,Task,"Well comm m I don't know . No . "
D,Task,"Well comm I think that touch-screens are generally square . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But it's the case you put around it that makes the shape . "
B,Minor,"We're "
C,Minor,"That isn't "
B,Task,"We put fashion in electronics comm "
B,Task,"so maybe we can uh "
D,Other,"Hmm ? "
D,Task,"Yeah okay comm "
D,Task,"but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen comm and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen . "
B,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that would cover it . "
D,Minor,"That "
C,Task,"That that would solve the problem . "
D,Task,"That's it's custom customisable and "
B,Task,"Oh comm yeah . Okay comm I I get it . "
A,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
C,Minor,"So mm Uh uh so "
C,Elicit,"uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ? "
C,Task,"I I I prefer rubber . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm me too . "
A,Task,"Me too . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah comm you too ? "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Elicit,"You sure ? "
C,Task,"You you you seemed to hesitate a bit . "
B,Task,"That's good . "
B,Task,"Well comm as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm comm and you don't uh it's not bendable or something comm "
D,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
B,Task,"I th I think that goes too far . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"No comm that that that that's gonna The the chip set will hold it firm in place comm "
C,Task,"and uh and and uh and a L_C_D_ screen also "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . "
C,Task,"Yeah it m might it might . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh comm tra uh traditional versus L_C_D_ comm well I figured we we all set on that . "
C,Task,"And uh comm then also the simple versus advanced . "
C,Task,"Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_ comm we we should have the advanced . "
A,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So that shouldn't be a problem . "
C,Task,"Okay comm well that's my uh "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
C,Other,"Uh comm you're welcome . "
D,Other,"Can I uh do my thing ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . Do your thing comm Tim . "
D,Minor,"It uh "
B,Other,"Do your thing . "
A,Other,"Bring it on . "
D,Other,"Expert map . "
D,Minor,"Okay uh "
D,Task,"Last week "
D,Task,"I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching . "
D,Task,"For marketing . "
D,Task,"Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan . "
D,Task,"In Paris and Milan comm we uh asked different people comm uh differing in age and in income comm uh the amount of money to spend comm um what they like in design uh and material nowadays . "
D,Task,"Findings . "
D,Task,"Our main audience comm uh so that's people below forty comm uh prefer the following . "
D,Task,"At first comm the colours of fruit . "
D,Task,"Very basic colours comm like Janus explained . "
D,Task,"Um comm fresh colours comm uh green comm red comm uh strawberry red comm uh yellow comm banana yellow . "
D,Task,"Um comm considering material comm um "
D,Task,"Yeah . They like spongy material comm "
B,Task,"Spongeball . "
D,Task,"like yeah a sponge-ball . "
D,Task,"Like a s soft material . "
D,Task,"Janus m uh mentioned it also . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I think he did some uh "
D,Task,"some findings himself . "
C,Task,"Well comm the Teletubbies sh "
D,Elicit,"You wer you weren't in Paris ? "
D,Task,"Okay . Like this . "
D,Task,"Like big uh g flashy colours . Fresh . "
A,Task,"Flashy . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It's nice comm I think . "
D,Task,"Okay comm our secondary audience comm uh people above forty a forty years in age comm they like the dark traditional colours . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm uh materials like wood that "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of . "
C,Task,"Well comm you could . You you could . "
D,Minor,"No n j just j just a w "
A,Task,"Yeah but never seen one . "
B,Other,"It'll float . "
D,Task,"No comm okay comm but just just a wooden uh look . "
A,Task,"Case . Oh comm a wooden look comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor . "
B,Minor,"Tables . "
D,Task,"The that isn't wood anyway comm but "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Okay ? "
D,Task,"But comm that's our secondary audience . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So comm uh we decided to take "
D,Task,"mm yeah the people below forty . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"So comm that this doesn't apply . "
D,Task,"'Kay comm the third . "
D,Task,"Uh comm there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . "
D,Task,"They have to look fancy . "
D,Task,"Um comm they should be technological in innovative . "
D,Task,"That means uh there have to be fancy things in . "
D,Task,"Uh comm and easy to use . "
D,Task,"But that's common . "
D,Task,"My personal preferences . "
D,Task,"We have to aim at a mu at the main audience . And uh comm therefore use fresh colours . "
A,Elicit,"Would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or "
D,Other,"Uh comm I'll I'll come to that in a second point . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Here comm think about removable covers comm as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Like the Nokia uh the removable covers comm uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Uh comm a third comm material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber . "
D,Task,"Um comm two advantages . "
D,Task,"Uh comm it fits within the current market trends . "
D,Task,"And uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it . So "
D,Task,"Uh to come back to your question comm I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard . "
D,Task,"Like uh seen on regular mobile phones . "
D,Task,"Actually comm they have a lot in common . The phones and the "
C,Task,"Well comm I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote comm so Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . Okay . "
B,Minor,"Ah . "
A,Task,"Maybe you could use your remote as a phone . "
C,Other,"Hey . "
B,Other,"Hey . "
C,Task,"That might be a next step . "
A,Task,"There are numbers on it comm so uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm exactly . "
D,Task,"Uh comm in my second sheet of personal preferences comm uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition . "
D,Task,"Uh comm it's very innovative . Innovative . "
A,Elicit,"So that you say um S_P_S_S_ comm and it goes to uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm like something . "
D,Task,"You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies comm like speak uh speech recognition and stuff . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"But comm we have to keep the cost in uh in mind comm "
D,Minor,"but it "
B,Task,"Twelve fifty uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it it can be uh very expensive . "
D,Task,"'Kay comm second . "
D,Task,"Uh comm building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users . "
D,Task,"Uh comm also the link with uh mobile phones . Uh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but you don't use that th games when you watching television comm I think . "
D,Minor,"No comm but "
C,Task,"Well comm yeah . "
D,Task,"No comm okay . But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call . "
D,Task,"It's just the same . "
B,Task,"When your parents are watching some boring program comm you can take the remote and do something else . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"When you're at college . "
C,Other,"You take your uh remote with you to school . "
D,Minor,"Uh No . You al "
A,Other,"You take your remote control with you . "
B,Other,"Take it . "
D,Minor,"you also take uh t "
D,Task,"you take your IPac and go uh play games . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Well comm I do that comm but "
D,Minor,"Okay comm and um "
D,Task,"And third comm I stick with it comm the log-in functionality uh with the slogan comm take parental control to a new dimension . "
B,Minor,"Ooh . S "
C,Task,"Very nice . "
D,Task,"That's it . "
A,Task,"Uh great . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"In "
B,Task,"Okay . Um the interface contents . "
B,Task,"Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up "
B,Other,"I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there . "
B,Task,"But comm the main concept is um take one big touch screen . "
B,Task,"Um comm always display the primary buttons clear and visible . "
B,Task,"Maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space . "
B,Task,"And uh make the menu structure changeable . "
B,Task,"So if you press um system comm that's "
B,Task,"Yeah comm well m multiple system options can comm maybe five or ten or or one comm can fit in . "
B,Task,"Or maybe even a step further when you want to um "
B,Task,"t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . "
B,Task,"And um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary . "
B,Minor,"And um well comm how do uh do we want to look at uh uh f um Yeah "
B,Task,"Does a remote look "
B,Task,"Well comm it's you've gotta hold it in one hand . "
B,Task,"So um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small comm so you can put it in inside your hands . "
B,Task,"And some remotes you can use with your thumb . "
B,Task,"But I think that's too difficult for this one . "
B,Task,"So you can make it s a little broader . Yeah . And here ? "
B,Task,"And maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons . "
B,Task,"And use your other hands on the menu structure . "
B,Task,"So here are gonna be the program buttons . One comm two comm three comm four comm et cetera . "
B,Task,"And the the volume control and program control maybe . "
B,Task,"And comm down here comm um comm I added comm this could be one uh big L_C_D_ . Um comm the menu structure . "
B,Task,"So you can use it in uh in this way . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"One thing you've gotta keep in mind comm keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . "
B,Task,"Um comm know that if you are changing the menu structure here comm um "
B,Task,"And well comm I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . "
B,Task,"But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_ comm do not display twenty other options that are possible . "
B,Task,"Just keep it as simple as uh as possible . "
B,Task,"And do not use too many levels . "
B,Task,"Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus comm and um push plus twenty times . "
B,Task,"But just the um uh just in one button if possible . "
B,Task,"And um comm well comm you kn you all know the T_V_ levels . "
B,Task,"Um comm channel one comm two . And when you get to n to uh to ten comm ye and want to go back comm uh well you have a problem . "
B,Task,"Just m most most modern T_V_s comm you you press one zero comm and it goes to ten . "
B,Task,"And else comm to one and through after that . "
B,Task,"So the s a button less . "
B,Task,"And um comm things like teletext comm put them in the menu . "
B,Minor,"Things like um um "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Uh comm "
D,Task,"what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah w Yeah comm I I find I must trying to uh tell it . "
D,Task,"L like in uh internet explorer . "
B,Task,"Is uh volume plus and minus ? "
B,Task,"And this is program uh plus "
B,Task,"and minus . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah okay comm but does it that is for uh going from four to five . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"But if you go from two to eight comm and you want "
B,Task,"Or if you're watching Studio Sports on uh on seventeen comm and your wife is watching some soap on two "
D,Task,"Yeah comm and on two . "
D,Task,"That you can switch switch easy . "
B,Task,"Well yes comm I think that's a good idea . "
B,Task,"But um comm well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . "
D,Task,"Yeah it is . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And if you're using that button a lot of times comm well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen . "
B,Task,"You just don't have to play games uh in-between . "
B,Task,"But if you're really switching between two channels comm you won't have time uh to d use the other options . "
D,Minor,"Mm no . "
B,Task,"Um comm yeah already already told that . "
D,Task,"That's it . "
B,Task,"Yeah . That's my conclusion . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with . "
A,Task,"The parental control comm the games comm and the voice recognition . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Task,"There's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh "
A,Task,"I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote . "
A,Elicit,"I don't know how you think about it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well comm I agree comm "
B,Task,"just put it in the menu structure somewhere . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm yeah um system properties comm um parental control . "
D,Minor,"Yeah but "
D,Minor,"What I see uh "
D,Task,"How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents comm children . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Something like that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm w well comm yeah . "
D,Task,"And w when you want to use the parents uh option comm you have to "
B,Task,"It it has to be fast . "
B,Task,"You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm ok "
A,Task,"No but I think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television comm and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer comm so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Why "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"You c may use like when there's uh X_P_ comm uh a simple log-on comm d you just push uh one or two or three . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Pu push parents . "
B,Task,"And if you push parents comm then "
D,Minor,"That then "
D,Task,"then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in . "
B,Task,"Yeah . To log in . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"And if you puts a ye "
D,Task,"Like two one three . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"And it's in . "
B,Task,"And if you w you push p children comm uh you don't have to uh log in comm but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It automatically goes Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it . "
C,Task,"Because well it's a simple function comm but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it . "
C,Task,"Because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And I'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it . "
C,Minor,"I don't know what "
A,Task,"Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it comm "
A,Task,"because uh you Yeah comm you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff comm and you heard on the news that uh that he Yeah comm they believe that children uh are influenced by the television comm "
D,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
D,Minor,"V violent T_V_ . "
A,Minor,"and uh "
A,Task,"Well comm we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years . "
A,Task,"But there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Well comm maybe um some idea on that . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Just make through a remote as it is comm but make an option to insert profiles comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"'cause if my grandad would buy this remote comm he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Just make it an option in menu comm ins install powerful profiles or something . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"That's a that's a better idea ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store comm it has to be just simple and plain . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But if you want to install it personally uh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"If I got kids comm and I could choose between uh two remote controls . One uh w with parent control and one without comm and I would would buy the one with . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm with and one without . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm b well comm still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones . "
D,Task,"I th Yeah . "
B,Task,"You're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see comm but well comm I I when I think comm oh yeah comm for the f for all the standard channels comm and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come "
B,Task,"and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead of uh of channels comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"because if you're watching uh comm I don't know comm you're in the at day uh comm cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night . I don't know . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm maybe it can work with show view . "
A,Task,"Uh comm you you can control your video recorder with show view . "
A,Task,"Uh comm when you tick in a number comm it will uh start and end uh recording . "
A,Task,"But maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent comm and that they are blocked out . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's true . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"will have to decide uh "
D,Task,"Yeah but yeah but that isn't possible . "
B,Task,"That isn't possible . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"But comm well comm if you want to "
C,Task,"I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control comm uh let's say we do comm and and well whatever comm cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Well uh comm nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"Well comm yeah you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then comm but "
C,Minor,"But that "
C,Task,"Well comm I'm not sure because um for that to happen comm you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control comm so it would comm yeah comm have to be constant uh constant signalling . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . "
C,Task,"And that uh provides parental control comm for instance . "
C,Task,"And that's just an optional uh device . "
C,Minor,"So there's n that's there's "
C,Task,"uh besides uh the remote control comm you'll have a separate uh "
A,Task,"I wouldn't put it in an optional device . "
A,Task,"That that then then then it becomes too much comm I think . "
C,Task,"Yeah ? "
A,Task,"If we do it comm we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile comm a parent profile comm and a family profile comm and otherwise . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm and "
B,Task,"Yeah comm on a separate menu uh option . "
D,Task,"And and you know w uh when you install another device comm uh children can still go up to the T_V_ comm p pop open uh the thing and and and g "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . That's true comm "
D,Task,"go to a channel . "
C,Task,"but uh at same instant comm same happens when uh you have remote control . So "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah of course . "
D,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"But comm only difference is uh the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control comm "
C,Task,"and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Ah it's "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm okay . "
C,Minor,"So comm you you'd be "
D,Task,"But it's just an an added feature feature . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? "
A,Task,"I personally think that that becomes too much . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm well yeah comm I "
A,Task,"It's more like it gets you to the functionality comm but "
B,Task,"A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh comm hearing loud noises from the T_V_ comm someone screaming one comm and you f the channel switches comm uh Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm like f voice recognition is too much comm I think . But "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And games ? "
D,Minor,"games . It doesn't "
C,Task,"Yeah . I can see games happening . Yeah . "
B,Task,"W you can put it on chip anyway comm so uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"That that doesn't c that doesn't co "
A,Minor,"That would "
B,Task,"As long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote comm "
B,Minor,"but uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources comm I think . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So that will uh that that that must be in it comm you think ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that will be nice . "
A,Task,"Okay . So the games uh are in it . "
A,Task,"The voice recognition are not . "
A,Task,"And the parental control are "
B,Task,"Optional in "
A,Elicit,"optional ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it's it's in it . But too ma I I think so comm but "
B,Elicit,"But how we do it ? "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well comm I think also it's a good idea comm buts very difficult to incorporate . "
B,Task,"So we should make it too complex . "
B,Task,"Is t some menu uh function comm you choose parental control comm and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm but uh will there uh uh "
A,Elicit,"Like the first idea uh from uh You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"Ye I I think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option . "
D,Minor,"To put "
D,Task,"Yeah comm to put it in always . "
B,Minor,"You can put on "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And you can just uh s when you buy it comm you can select um personal preference comm parental control on comm and the password or something . "
A,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
C,Task,"Well comm I don't know . "
C,Task,"I I figure if you had two different remotes comm you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . "
C,Task,"So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control . "
C,Task,"But it would would be uh more expensive . "
C,Task,"So comm a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model . "
C,Task,"Could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model comm uh for instance . "
B,Task,"Oh comm it's a p Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but T_V_s aren't capable of sending . "
C,Task,"Yes they are . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I thought they were just "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm you yo "
C,Task,"Yeah comm you you have some T_V_s any "
D,Task,"a able to receive . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm some . But "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but most often not . "
C,Task,"Yeah . That is true comm that is true . "
B,Task,"Well comm maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs comm where the parent says comm you cannot watch channel seven comm nine comm and ten comm and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And there's just some little uh clock in the remote . "
C,Task,"Well yeah comm you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm j just some rules . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But you still have the problem about uh the television itself . "
B,Task,"No comm no comm it's very simple . "
B,Minor,"There uh th I h "
B,Task,"I've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"So comm the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"But comm on the T_V_ "
B,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"at least my T_V_ comm is a is a compartment which you can press . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And there are buttons uh behind it which you can use comm if you d if you don't if you don't have a "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well comm that's "
B,Task,"To put it very blunt comm that's not our problem . "
B,Task,"Just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh It's not not a part of the remote . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that is true . Yeah comm that is true . "
B,Minor,"You have to f Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm you could you could you could go like "
B,Task,"Uh comm or make it ourselves very diffic "
C,Task,"uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy . "
C,Task,"You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I figured I figure we could do that . Yeah comm yeah comm sure . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Or j Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh comm I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it comm but "
D,Minor,"Ah "
D,Other,"I have to uh consult my legal advisor about it . "
A,Task,"Okay . So uh I think we have decided on the things that Uh from Janus comm the energy comm the combination between battery and kinetic . "
A,Task,"The case will be double-curved and uh rubber comm in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable . "
A,Task,"The buttons will be uh touch-screen . Uh but there may not be too many buttons . "
A,Task,"And in the the menu structure comm uh there must not to be uh "
A,Task,"Five minutes to go . "
A,Task,"Uh comm too uh too many levels . "
A,Task,"And uh it must be easy to use . "
A,Task,"The parental control will be incorporated comm but it must be not too complex . "
A,Task,"And the games are in it . "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I think we have uh we have decided uh comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Consensus . "
A,Task,"Uh comm little more . "
D,Other,"Oh . Oh . I I have one thing left . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Maybe for uh Jerome . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah ? I'm listening . "
D,Task,"Um comm the views . "
D,Task,"Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view . "
A,Elicit,"Like a like a moat or s or something . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um comm well "
D,Minor,"Like at "
C,Minor,"User profile . "
D,Task,"In the experts view comm you have a lot of more buttons . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but you have that in the "
B,Task,"What I was thinking about is just a menu structure comm when you don't use it is simple . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And when you push uh system properties comm uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program . "
A,Minor,"You use the "
A,Task,"Yeah . It's already incorporated a little in that concept . "
D,Task,"Mm yeah comm okay . Fairly enough . Yeah . "
C,Task,"Well yeah comm you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself comm for the more advanced users . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm wh which buttons you like or not . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm which buttons do you want to in it . "
C,Task,"Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button comm and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Just leave the other numbers away . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm you could you could m have people want uh want that . "
A,Task,"We take it to the other meeting comm "
A,Elicit,"okay ? "
D,Task,"Okay . Go on . "
A,Other,"I have a little w uh little chat to do "
C,Task,"Ah comm yeah comm sure . "
A,Task,"and uh then we uh finish . "
D,Other,"A little chat . "
A,Task,"I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh can come in handy uh for us . "
A,Task,"First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management . "
A,Task,"Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge comm uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is uh like that . "
A,Task,"It's it's uh very hot at the moment comm "
A,Task,"so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh "
D,Task,"Marketing . "
A,Task,"marketing "
A,Elicit,"or did I said management ? "
D,Task,"Management . "
A,Task,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Just talking about myself . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's my function comm to "
A,Minor,"Uh W "
D,Task,"Okay . Go on . "
A,Task,"What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote comm just some uh Yeah . Import export . "
A,Task,"And uh another one . "
B,Task,"Som some bench-marker . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm they're a ha they're at "
A,Task,"Yeah comm benchmarking comm that's the word I saw . "
A,Minor,"I uh couldn't uh "
A,Task,"Okay comm uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey comm and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider comm instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us . "
A,Task,"So comm we must uh we must bring it as if uh Real Reaction is uh is big company comm uh a trustful company comm "
A,Minor,"and uh it has m "
D,Minor,"How "
D,Task,"I know a marketing name for our product . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"R_ th R_ to the third power . "
D,Task,"R_ three . Real Reaction remote . "
A,Task,"I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm ? "
A,Task,"When you uh put on remote comm you see a kind of a just like when you telephone comm you see a little uh animation . "
B,Task,"Uh comm logo . Yeah ? "
D,Other,"Bling . "
A,Task,"Real Reaction remote . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And uh with the with the with the motto comm we put fashion in electronics . "
A,Minor,"And then you go uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm but it has to be like a split second comm because you have to put in a code also and "
A,Minor,"The "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well comm you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds comm they'll still remember it . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . But w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own . "
B,Task,"And it it l linger on every time you see it . "
C,Task,"Well comm if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen comm you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"And it could just stay there . "
D,Task,"That spins around like all the time . "
A,Minor,"Mm yep comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that spins around or something . "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Very annoying . "
A,Task,"Also also . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"But we we are uh "
D,Task,"It it's just like a uh globe in Internet Explorer . "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah y yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm something like that . A small icon . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm but uh think about that kind of things . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"comm I It's ok For f "
A,Task,"That's what they said in the master class . . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Oh comm for the next meeting comm right ? "
A,Task,"N Uh comm next meeting starts in thirty minutes . "
D,Minor,"Who uh "
A,Task,"So uh maybe you can go to Paris and Milan uh once again . "
D,Elicit,"Who who gave you the master class ? "
A,Other,"The master class ? "
D,Elicit,"Ronald Betenberg ? "
A,Task,"Franz Mehler's . "
D,Other,"Okay comm thanks . "
A,Task,"Uh comm very special comm uh next uh session . "
A,Minor,"Uh idea that you uh "
A,Task,"the the industrial uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype . "
A,Task,"And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard . "
A,Task,"So that's a kinda new uh thing . "
D,Other,"Ah . "
A,Task,"And um comm the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation . "
A,Task,"But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email . "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Elicit,"So we're going to work together right now ? "
B,Minor,"Stay here and "
A,Task,"Yeah comm the well comm uh dids this what I uh what I heard . "
A,Minor,"I "
D,Task,"In the master class . "
A,Task,"Not in the master class . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh "
B,Minor,"P_ . "
A,Task,"But I think it was a very uh very good uh session comm uh gentlemen . "
B,Other,"Ah comm no new email . "
C,Task,"Definitely . "
D,Task,"Me too . "
A,Other,"I will thank you all . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Well thank you too . "
B,Other,"Thank you . Thank you very much . "
A,Minor,"And uh "
D,Other,"Thank you too comm lord . "
A,Other,"Give me a good evaluation . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Other,"'Kay guys comm lot of success . "
C,Other,"You wish . "
C,Other,"M Aye ? Cheers . "
B,Other,"See you . "
A,Other,"Cheers . "
A,Task,"See you in a half hour . "
C,Other,"Hey . "
A,Task,"But keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm uh I'm not sure if we uh we "
C,Task,"Because I saw something about individual actions . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but th there's there's still the my uh instructions that you will work together . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Here ? Or uh "
A,Task,"That's not my problem . "
