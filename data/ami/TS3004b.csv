C,Task,"I was a little short on time comm "
B,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm me too comm "
C,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"so that's not "
B,Task,"Yeah comm same here . "
A,Task,"No no no comm "
A,Minor,"I just fi first my "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Minor,"Uh let's see . "
B,Elicit,"Which one was mine ? "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"let's have a look comm "
A,Task,"we have forty minutes comm "
A,Task,"so it's it's more than enough . "
A,Task,"Okay comm perfect . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"we have "
A,Other,"Oh no comm "
A,Elicit,"what's that ? "
A,Minor,"So so "
A,Task,"we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting comm "
A,Task,"and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure comm that we are comm "
B,Task,"Good . "
A,Task,"that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like look like . "
A,Task,"Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting comm "
A,Other,"so I showed uh show them to you . "
A,Other,"Oh comm sorry about that comm "
A,Other,"I just escape this one . "
A,Elicit,"How do I escape this ? "
C,Other,"What ? "
A,Elicit,"How do I I escape this s uh presentation ? "
B,Task,"Uh left . "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Other,"Ah okay . "
C,Minor,"Just "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"And show comm "
A,Other,"sorry . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"let's have a look s at this one . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Elicit,"the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um Should be a univ uh universal remote control "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Minor,"that's I uh s "
A,Task,"I just got a email from the from the personal coach "
A,Task,"and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"have you changed that part ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Um so yeah comm "
A,Task,"it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . "
A,Task,"It's it's still the same . Um "
A,Task,"All these points uh we have to look at . "
A,Task,"You all know them . "
A,Task,"But uh there's another point . "
A,Task,"The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . "
A,Task,"So they're old and not younger people . "
A,Task,"So we have to look at that as well . "
A,Task,"'Specially old people comm maybe bi bigger buttons or something comm "
A,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh so So "
A,Task,"yeah comm that's it comm "
A,Task,"so just you can do your presentation "
A,Minor,"for uh "
B,Elicit,"Which one first ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Oh it doesn't matter comm "
A,Minor,"just start with the "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . Uh "
B,Task,"Functional requirements comm yeah "
D,Minor,"Okay . Well "
D,Task,"my name is Jens Damman comm "
D,Task,"but we're in a group comm "
D,Other,"and I I will start it . "
D,Minor,"Wait . Um "
D,Task,"I've used a marketing report on uh the site . "
D,Task,"Uh I think you've uh read it too . "
D,Task,"Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site . "
A,Task,"I I didn't read i read it comm "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Task,"it's not for me comm "
D,Elicit,"You didn't read it ? "
A,Task,"I didn't get it uh anyway . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"I didn don't thing we got it . "
D,Other,"Oh okay comm "
A,Task,"It's only for you . "
D,Task,"I I was the only one who get it . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"Okay "
D,Task,"it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . "
D,Task,"And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . "
D,Task,"So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . "
D,Task,"Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I think uh uh that's a lot comm "
D,Task,"so we have to make a beautiful remote control . "
D,Task,"Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . "
D,Task,"I think this fits uh at the uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . "
D,Task,"Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . "
D,Task,"Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . "
D,Task,"Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"okay comm that's uh normal . "
D,Task,"I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . "
D,Task,"But that's one of our requirements . "
A,Task,"The last point is quite an interesting "
D,Task,"Yes comm "
D,Task,"fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . "
D,Task,"Um Martijn alr already said it . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"if we "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one comm "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"I don't think it's uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"we should have the ten percent on the on the top comm "
D,Task,"reachable . "
A,Minor,"then you're you're "
D,Task,"Yeah comm the ten percent on the top comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"That that's a good one . "
D,Task,"Um uh page two . "
D,Task,"Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . "
D,Task,"That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . "
D,Task,"Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system comm "
D,Task,"so when you clap your hands it will beep or something . "
D,Task,"Uh you must find it uh quickly . "
B,Task,"Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station . "
B,Task,"So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station . "
D,Task,"Okay comm yeah . Yeah comm "
D,Task,"we can uh combine that . "
D,Task,"Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . "
D,Task,"Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . "
D,Task,"It's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent . "
D,Task,"But it's uh a tough one . "
D,Task,"Because if we make a ha whole new product comm our own style comm we we c uh this is so difficult comm uh a difficulty I think . "
D,Task,"Uh next comm remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but only if they zap a lot comm and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . "
D,Minor,"I don't We we haven't "
D,Task,"Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"last page . "
D,Task,"Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets comm like uh speech recognition . "
D,Task,"We didn't uh think about that already . "
D,Task,"And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . "
D,Task,"We already thought about that . "
D,Task,"Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . "
D,Minor,"And "
D,Task,"but they're more critical . "
D,Task,"And older people uh want to spend uh more money . "
D,Task,"But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features comm "
D,Task,"because they're in their old uh thinking way . "
D,Task,"And they want to keep the old uh things the old things . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"we have uh a new uh age of forty plus . "
D,Elicit,"But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ? "
A,Task,"People . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"yeah comm "
A,Task,"so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control comm "
D,Task,"I I think we can speak comm uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"because "
D,Task,"because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"It's too "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Um then "
D,Other,"I have my personal uh preference . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"that's not very good comm "
D,Task,"because I thought about television comm D_V_D_ player comm stereo and V_C_R_ . "
D,Task,"I had a question about . "
D,Task,"But it's already out of the question comm this . "
D,Task,"Um my point is comm well comm I If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television comm I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . "
D,Task,"But it's the exercise . "
A,Elicit,"Because it's too expensive . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm only only for television uh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm probably . "
D,Task,"On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . "
D,Task,"And we only make it for television comm "
D,Task,"so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but good usability comm "
B,Task,"so you can use it . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"I told about the home station . "
D,Task,"Uh it must be simple comm "
D,Task,"because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . "
D,Task,"And I I found a motto . "
D,Task,"And we put the fashion in electronics . "
D,Task,"And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . "
D,Task,"We we have to make a a new product . "
D,Task,"We have to be um Yeah . One of a kind comm I think . "
A,Task,"So it has to look uh uh uh unique comm "
B,Task,"Unique . "
D,Task,"The company is about our uh th th their own fashion comm their own style . "
A,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I reckon "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But old people are not looking for that . "
B,Minor,"Uh I think mm "
A,Task,"Not really . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
C,Task,"I think the main thing is the usability comm that's where we can uh make it a special product . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"to k to keep it simple when you "
A,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
B,Task,"But uh we also have to stand out comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Sorry "
D,Task,"I thought about it comm yes . "
B,Task,"'cause there are already comm like you said comm so many controls out that support lot of stuff . "
B,Task,"But we have to make sure that we're better usability comm "
B,Task,"and stand out by just looks of it . "
B,Task,"So make it just a different colour or different shape comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Okay . "
B,Minor,"so "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"this was uh my presentation . "
A,Other,"Thanks . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"I don't "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Paul comm you can do the next one if you want . "
D,Task,"You can ask some questions or something . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah well Uh . "
A,Task,"It's on the on the uh net net uh thing comm "
B,Task,"There it is . "
A,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Technical functions design . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm well comm so "
B,Task,"we have s mm uh broad audience . "
B,Task,"Isn't that isn't true anymore . "
B,Task,"But um we have elderly people comm "
B,Task,"so we need to keep it simple . "
B,Task,"Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . "
B,Task,"Not too full comm "
B,Task,"like uh Jens already said comm only ten percent is being used . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I have it on the next page . "
B,Task,"But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Um so "
B,Task,"the options that we put on there should be easy to use comm "
B,Task,"and 'cause you have more room then comm "
B,Task,"and for elderly people big buttons . "
B,Task,"Uh an icon on it or text on it comm "
B,Task,"so it's very clear what that buttons does . "
B,Task,"So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . "
B,Task,"Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet "
B,Task,"or just ask some random people comm elderly people what they use comm what they want on a remote control "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"to find out . "
B,Task,"But there is already in a one done . "
B,Task,"Of functions I could think of . Uh volume comm channels comm the the basic according to . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . "
B,Minor,"And I found an uh "
B,Task,"Could I think of favourites ? "
B,Task,"I always look up the same um pages on text "
B,Task,"and always have to click the number . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But if you could make a new option comm that you just have to press one button "
B,Minor,"and you get on your "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . "
C,Task,"So you might as well remember the number . "
C,Elicit,"Or not ? "
B,Minor,"No y "
A,Task,"Maybe i maybe it's too complicated comm "
A,Task,"but not sure . "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Task,"It's a good idea comm "
B,Minor,"it's "
B,Task,"It was just a thought . "
A,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"I'm comm I u "
B,Task,"I would find it handy comm I think comm when you just press one button and you get on six six six . "
C,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Elicit,"But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ? "
B,Minor,"Well uh "
A,Minor,"Uh "
B,Task,"what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands comm basics commands to uh the television . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"switch to channel six . "
C,Minor,"Yeah ? "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Task,"button six says says six . "
B,Task,"And if you make favourites comm it can say six six six in a row . "
B,Task,"Just numbers . "
B,Minor,"That can be in the in the "
C,Other,"Yeah okay . "
C,Elicit,"But uh uh for a user to to remember comm if I press that button it goes to that channel . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"if you said a favourite "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"but isn't it hard to remember ? "
C,Minor,"Like favourite one and "
A,Minor,"Uh mayb for me it's "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Minor,"i "
A,Task,"If I use my telephone comm I never use those buttons to to to call "
B,Elicit,"Never ? "
A,Minor,"sh "
A,Task,"Never . "
C,Task,"No comm neither do I . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
B,Other,"Oh are you ? "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"And "
B,Other,"Okay now comm "
B,Task,"m maybe not . "
A,Task,"If I don't do it comm maybe old people "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Minor,"maybe elderly people uh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"They don't like new features . "
B,Task,"So maybe not . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Um well "
B,Elicit,"play comm pause . I dunno if that's usable "
A,Task,"It's not comm it's still not It's not anymore n uh "
B,Minor,"when "
B,Other,"Not anymore for T_V_ . "
B,Minor,"Right comm "
B,Task,"on off . "
B,Task,"I dunno comm "
B,Elicit,"miss Did I miss any other buttons comm basic buttons ? "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"I couldn't think of any other comm 'specially not for T_V_ . "
A,Task,"Just on the front as well . "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"that's the only th the only thing you need . "
B,Minor,"Is "
C,Task,"Uh uh the p uh next and previous . "
C,Task,"Previous I know comm "
C,Elicit,"but next channel ? "
B,Minor,"Just the channel um uh What I mean is uh "
C,Minor,"I don't thi "
D,Task,"Forward . "
C,Elicit,"Li like a web browser comm "
B,Task,"Six seven eight or five . "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Other,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Task,"Just very simple . "
C,Task,"But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . "
C,Task,"Like a web browser back button . "
B,Task,"Um I dunno . "
A,Minor,"Uh Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"I don't have Uh I did "
A,Task,"I know what it is comm "
A,Task,"but I think it's all too difficult for old people . "
D,Minor,"No . Uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I don't think you use that . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Y only when you want to go to "
C,Other,"okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time . "
A,Elicit,"And how do you want to uh do it comm like if you have a channel above ten ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Normally you can press one comm zero or "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . "
B,Minor,"So you have that uh "
A,Elicit,"A ten plus "
A,Minor,"or "
B,Task,"Yeah comm the ten plus button . "
B,Task,"Just uh one one pressing comm or quickly after each other . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"To just keep it simple and standard uh features . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"w wouldn't it be a problem to uh Because you h have to be fast enough . "
C,Minor,"Maybe the elderly people "
B,Task,"Uh yeah mayb "
D,Task,"It gets some seconds . "
B,Task,"But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . "
B,Task,"But you can have a button that says um "
B,Task,"two two st two stripes . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Other,"Oh okay . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"it's it's no it's not a "
B,Task,"So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"but that's th mm "
D,Task,"It's what Paul says . "
D,Task,"It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . "
D,Task,"It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"So if you have a universal T_V_ controller comm you needed one button that has two uh stripes . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"So we have a a period of comm I dunno comm five seconds to press those buttons comm and that And not for elderly people to look comm one two uh press and aim and "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"But do we still need a two level remote control ? "
A,Minor,"Because if we only have that l only f "
D,Task,"It's only for television now . "
B,Task,"So I I don't think so . "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Uh I just thought of another one . "
B,Task,"Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So you also need a menu button . "
B,Task,"And then uh navigation uh "
B,Task,"But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so you have "
C,Task,"I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use comm like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things comm and uh the menu button . "
B,Task,"four arrows . "
C,Task,"Because you n almost never use menu button . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"but um "
A,Task,"Maybe it's still still a good idea comm I'm not sure . "
A,Task,"You'll also have to use a mute button "
A,Minor,"to to "
B,Other,"Yeah comm a mute button . Yes . "
A,Minor,"Maybe comm not "
B,Other,"Don't think so . "
A,Elicit,"I don't know where where you have to put it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah well comm "
B,Task,"that's that's I think that's the layers that produce . "
B,Task,"Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use . "
A,Task,"Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"And later we can d uh do the design . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm uh "
B,Other,"now my personal preferences . "
B,Task,"Uh using the standards comm basic "
B,Task,"Um I think that we should stand out uh unique comm being unique with the design . "
B,Task,"So we have to comm I dunno comm uh make a different shape than usual . "
B,Task,"So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging comm that it stands out . "
B,Task,"Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . "
A,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Does it have to be Uh it has to be uh with different colours "
B,Task,"Um I dunno . Different colours um "
A,Minor,"or "
D,Task,"Maybe we can give it out in different colours . "
D,Task,"You can choose blue or yellow "
A,Task,"It's like a iMac or something . "
D,Minor,"or "
A,Minor,"Just to make it "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Elicit,"why not ? "
B,Minor,"Or Yeah . "
D,Task,"That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion . "
A,Task,"But it looks cheap as well comm "
A,Task,"because it's a small thing . "
A,Task,"It's only twenty five Euros . "
A,Minor,"It looks very cheap if you make it "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"maybe you can look at uh mobile phones . "
A,Minor,"Oh comm "
A,Minor,"you just "
A,Task,"I dunno what happened . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
B,Elicit,"Who ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm we have to look at mobile phones comm that's right . "
B,Task,"They they're uh designed very well . "
A,Minor,"Just "
B,Task,"And well basically are the same comm just a bit smaller . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small comm 'cause then you will always lo always lose it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But uh well comm I think that's a good example . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we hurry up a bit comm "
A,Task,"because otherwise we won't make it . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Other,"sorry . "
A,Minor,"Is it fin "
B,Minor,"Well uh "
A,Elicit,"Are you finished ? "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I I'm finished . "
B,Task,"I think we discussed everything . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Well comm "
C,Task,"the working design . "
C,Task,"The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . "
C,Minor,"Um Basically "
C,Task,"I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated comm "
C,Task,"but uh I could figure it out . "
C,Task,"Um basically what happens is you press a button comm "
C,Task,"uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button comm uh like a switch . "
C,Task,"And by closing that certain circuit comm the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"like you press a one comm that circuit is closed "
C,Minor,"and uh "
C,Task,"Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code "
C,Minor,"to uh "
C,Task,"And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . "
C,Task,"That's the uh light emitting diode comm I think . "
C,Task,"Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . "
C,Task,"That's un uh invisible to the human eye . "
C,Task,"And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . "
C,Task,"However it has also an uh a visible uh diode "
C,Task,"that's uh blinking red if you look in it . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"And that's uh another diode comm I believe . "
C,Task,"Because infrared is not visible . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"that's er uh do two different things "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ? "
C,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"Yeah . I I think so . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"j Is "
C,Task,"I I'm not sure if it's the same thing . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"it's I think it's usable . "
B,Elicit,"Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"that's active . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"Or just a green one comm "
A,Task,"because it's If you use it comm it's green or the red comm it's r green . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Maybe uh "
D,Task,"I I think it's in the case that it's active . "
D,Minor,"It's not uh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm when you press it . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
A,Minor,"But if you "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"I it's it's just uh the the "
C,Elicit,"Two ? "
A,Task,"Red's l shows up like something's wrong comm "
A,Task,"and green is like it's okay comm "
A,Task,"you press the button . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"Maybe depends on uh "
C,Minor,"Ma on on most "
C,Task,"on most uh uh remote controls it's red . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I know . "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we make it red . "
C,Minor,"So "
B,Minor,"But maybe "
C,Minor,"I know . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"we don't have to make it red . "
B,Task,"Maybe integrate it in the design as well . "
A,Minor,"You have to "
A,Task,"The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . "
A,Task,"Uh that's cool . "
B,Minor,"Uh Oh comm "
B,Minor,"maybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh "
C,Task,"I I think uh the batteries will be uh a little "
A,Task,"No comm "
A,Task,"we have a recharger in it comm "
D,Task,"Empty . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"so "
C,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"Uh maybe . "
A,Minor,"If we can still make that then "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but it doesn't have to be red . "
B,Task,"It's just to indicate something's on . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That it's working . "
C,Task,"That it's not not the batteries are low . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But it's cool if it was green . "
B,Task,"It's it's not very important comm "
A,Task,"Green or red or whatever comm it is cool . "
B,Minor,"so yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I know . "
C,Task,"Just to indicate it's working . "
B,Minor,"So mm "
C,Task,"And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . "
C,Task,"So we have to understand what patterns are used to comm you know comm to make it universal . "
C,Task,"So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . "
C,Task,"We have to really understand what patterns are used comm "
C,Minor,"so we can uh o On the "
C,Task,"Otherwise it won't work . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"we have to uh make buttons for that as well comm "
B,Minor,"to make it uh "
C,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"I I uh "
C,Task,"The chip um uh is producing the pattern . "
C,Task,"So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to comm y you know comm to "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"An automatically search function for each television comm or something . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That are working . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . "
C,Task,"It wasn't explained there . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Minor,"Uh I kno "
B,Task,"I I use a universal uh remote control comm "
B,Task,"and list of all the T_V_s you have comm etcetera . "
B,Task,"And you have to put in a number comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"so it works on your T_V_ . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm "
D,Task,"I have a modern one . "
D,Task,"And the modern one you you uh you type uh search comm "
D,Task,"and the LED began to blink blink blink . "
D,Task,"And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . "
D,Task,"And then you know comm oh it it's the right one . "
D,Task,"And you can stop it comm "
D,Task,"and then it's okay . "
C,Other,"Ah okay . "
D,Task,"So you don't have to search for your television or your code . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
D,Task,"It uh search uh the pattern for itself . "
C,Other,"Okay comm yeah . "
B,Other,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"so we use that . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"it uh "
C,Task,"We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Minor,"Because you have to "
B,Task,"Yep . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I just say "
A,Other,"Can you s just say it again comm "
A,Task,"because I was just looking "
C,Minor,"Uh okay . Well uh "
A,Minor,"There's just a short "
C,Task,"y you have this chip . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That's uh when the circuit is closed comm it produces the pattern . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . "
C,Task,"So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . "
C,Task,"And on the other T_V_ it won't work comm basically . "
C,Minor,"So uh basically "
C,Task,"what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And uh by d uh "
C,Task,"that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah comm changing this pattern all the time . "
D,Task,"Changing the signal . "
C,Task,"And um "
C,Task,"What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern comm this chip comm uh is trying to switch off the television . "
C,Task,"And when it's uh switched off comm you can push a button as uh it's working now comm "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"And then he saves that setting "
A,Other,"Okay . Yeah . "
C,Task,"and then um it's working . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm that's the right uh option . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Well uh "
C,Task,"the components . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"that's a bit technical comm "
C,Minor,"and I hadn't I w "
C,Task,"I was a little short on time . "
C,Other,"Um but I think I understand it . "
C,Task,"Um the energy source is uh the battery comm basically . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Um that's connecting to all the components . "
C,Task,"Because it has to be fed with energy . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Uh "
C,Task,"the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . "
C,Minor,"So basically "
C,Task,"when you press a button comm a switch get closed . "
C,Task,"Um that's connecting to a chip . "
C,Task,"So the chip knows what button you pressed . "
C,Task,"And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . "
C,Task,"I didn didn't put the description by this one . "
C,Task,"Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So that's the LED comm L_E_D_ . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm "
C,Task,"and this is a LED too . "
C,Task,"But this one is producing infrared light "
A,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Task,"that's invisible . "
C,Task,"And this one is producing normal light . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light comm but as a normal one . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"To flash up your "
D,Task,"Uh if you if you use the buttons comm uh both of them works . "
D,Task,"But one you can't see "
D,Task,"and one indicates that you use a button . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"presu "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
C,Minor,"Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work comm it can "
C,Minor,"Basically "
C,Task,"if the battery is low comm it won't work . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . "
A,Task,"So you see green if you push that button . "
C,Task,"Huh comm that's a good idea . "
D,Task,"Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but if you u if you do that comm you know that you're uh sending a signal . "
B,Other,"No comm y Yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And it's you also know which button you p "
D,Task,"But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
A,Minor,"But it "
D,Minor,"Everywhere in the r "
A,Elicit,"But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? "
A,Task,"You got still one LED . "
B,Task,"No I don't think so comm "
B,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"i it it will look different comm "
B,Task,"and I think we need to find something else . "
A,Task,"That looks different comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard comm "
B,Minor,"and our uh motto also is "
D,Elicit,"Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm w around the buttons comm or in the buttons even . "
D,Other,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but mm like when you push it "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"then then won't Then you won't see it . "
C,Minor,"n n "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"You have your finger over the button . "
C,Minor,"So you can see "
D,Task,"It must be around it then . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Or or m maybe on top of the A green light is flashing "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"then "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Not not not not here comm but here . "
C,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"Yeah . There . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Maybe uh "
A,Elicit,"The same as a telephone comm or a mobile phone comm or what do you mean ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm we're thinking about it . "
B,Task,"Uh on a mobile phone comm in the dark uh "
A,Minor,"If you push "
A,Task,"It lights up . Everything lights up . "
B,Task,"everything lights up . "
A,Task,"That's a good idea . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Why ain't that on a remote control ? "
A,Task,"It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it comm it's "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"It's f "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"i if you're in the dark comm you can't see the remote . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"No comm "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"But if we use a battery station comm "
B,Task,"which I think we will use "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"I uh "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's a good idea comm okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . We'll have enough power "
C,Minor,"to "
A,Minor,"Everything agre "
A,Elicit,"Everyone agrees with that comm "
A,Minor,"or "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Maybe what Paul said comm uh under the on the on the home station comm uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control comm that it beeps . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"and then you "
A,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"And also it's "
A,Task,"But you have to make a sound device in it then . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm there must be sound in it . "
C,Task,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
D,Other,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"it shouldn't take much "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"B "
C,Task,"maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money . "
C,Minor,"Because it's i it has to be "
D,Minor,"Mm uh comm "
D,Task,"twenty five Euros comm I think we can make it . "
B,Minor,"Uh I th "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half . "
D,Minor,"Bec "
D,Task,"Twelve and a half comm okay . "
D,Task,"But but we only have to make it for television comm "
D,Task,"and um we must have something special . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"I think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options . "
D,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"But we lose about ninety percent of those options . "
B,Minor,"So I think you can uh "
D,Task,"Uh . We have to give our customers some extras . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"I think we will save money with that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Are you almost finished "
A,Minor,"or just "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"the the personal preference comm I didn't fill it out . "
C,Task,"Because I was short on time . "
A,Task,"Okay . Okay . "
A,Other,"No worry . "
C,Minor,"But um "
C,Task,"Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"I just want to talk some about some more . "
A,Minor,"So maybe you have to "
C,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"this "
A,Other,"Oh comm sorry . "
A,Elicit,"Wh what's that ? "
A,Minor,"So uh "
A,Other,"Oh comm sorry . "
A,Task,"We have some new uh project requirements . "
A,Task,"We have to have a look what they are . "
A,Minor,"They're still in um "
A,Task,"Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . "
A,Task,"So a teletext option comm maybe we have to skip that one . "
A,Task,"I'm not sure . "
A,Task,"I don't think so comm "
C,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext comm still use . "
A,Minor,"but "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . "
A,Task,"It's only one button . "
A,Minor,"So I don't think it is "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"We definitely should use it . Um "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"that's uh what I told you . "
A,Task,"The remote control should only be used for a television . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"that's maybe easier . "
A,Task,"And um the the forty plus people comm I already told you . "
A,Minor,"Oh "
A,Task,"no comm "
A,Other,"sorry . "
A,Task,"Oh comm this is a problem . "
A,Other,"Oh sorry about that . "
A,Task,"The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . "
A,Task,"So it should be flashy or just more interesting . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
C,Other,"Oh . Mm . "
B,Other,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"that's It changes things . "
A,Other,"I'm sorry about that . "
A,Task,"I just I just didn't read it well . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"does it make some decision about that ? "
D,Task,"Changes . "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"That kinda changes the whole situation . "
D,Minor,"Uh "
B,Minor,"Well yeah comm "
B,Task,"then we have to make some nice features . "
B,Task,"I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way comm "
B,Task,"to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern . "
A,Task,"That still stays . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's important I think "
B,Minor,"and "
D,Task,"L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think . "
B,Task,"And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control comm "
B,Task,"especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it . "
D,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm ah "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"I I don't y you'll use it often comm "
C,Task,"because you can see on the television wh what channel you "
D,Task,"Oh comm I'm watching uh the channel one . "
D,Task,"Okay . No comm it's not "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I tho I think that's not usable . "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"So comm but uh Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"What other features can we put in ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . "
C,Task,"And uh then the usability is not that required comm "
C,Task,"because the Like in the mobile phones comm usability is not that good I think . "
D,Task,"But uh some of you had uh something to read about um uh speech uh recognition . "
D,Task,"About you said one and the television turns on one . "
D,Elicit,"Is that reachable maybe ? "
D,Task,"That's very That's fancy . That's cool . "
C,Task,"I didn't read "
B,Task,"It's very fashion . "
C,Task,"I didn't read any "
D,Task,"Twelve and you've got twelve . "
C,Minor,"b "
C,Other,"Yeah . Yeah okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Only the numbers comm only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers comm one to twenty or something . "
C,Task,"I I know . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"That should be cool . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . "
D,Task,"If it's possible comm "
A,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"I didn't read it . "
A,Task,"I don't think it's very expensive actually . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Elicit,"Why should it ? "
D,Minor,"Uh if i if i "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think it's "
A,Task,"You only have a microphone in it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I didn't have information about that . "
C,Task,"But it has to work . "
C,Elicit,"And and and does it have to work only in English comm or in Dutch too or "
A,Task,"Nah comm maybe "
D,Minor,"Ah "
D,Task,"that's a problem comm "
D,Minor,"but "
C,Minor,"And and uh w Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Uh only in English . Only in English I think . "
B,Minor,"What "
B,Task,"But uh I dunno how that works then . "
B,Minor,"Uh does your uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Other,"it's probably my job to figure that out comm "
B,Elicit,"Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever "
C,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"No comm "
B,Elicit,"uh one to have in channel one ? "
D,Minor,"that "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"then th we have to think about that . "
D,Elicit,"But do do we do it ? "
D,Task,"It's more if we if we do it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Elicit,"is it very usable ? "
B,Task,"That's what I'm looking at . "
C,Elicit,"And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"or "
B,Minor,"Is "
A,Task,"Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that . "
A,Minor,"It "
A,Task,"We have short time to to put it on the market comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Minor,"so that "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that . "
B,Minor,"Mm Yeah well "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
A,Task,"We make uh make uh comm we can make th th the new remote control very flashy . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"and uh and uh "
B,Minor,"It's "
D,Task,"In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . "
D,Task,"Uh because we we have a lot of languages . "
B,Minor,"I d "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . "
C,Minor,"And and "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . I think so . "
C,Task,"and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition comm you can just throw the uh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke comm and the T_V_ turns uh to one . "
C,Task,"the remote away . "
C,Minor,"Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah comm okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"it's not uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Well yeah comm "
B,Task,"that's the right command . "
B,Task,"And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one comm or something . Not just one comm "
C,Minor,"But "
C,Other,"Hmm yeah comm T_V_ one . "
B,Minor,"but "
D,Other,"Okay comm "
D,Minor,"but th that becomes your f Uh uh "
D,Task,"because that's very hard for uh speech recognition . "
B,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"But I don't think comm it just ain't useful enough . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"we have to make some decisions . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"you can see on the uh "
D,Task,"Okay comm no speech recognition . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Elicit,"we have to know what we're going to put on . "
A,Elicit,"Do we comm do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? "
A,Minor,"Do "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
A,Task,"If you press something comm it lights up for a few seconds comm "
A,Task,"so you can see what other but buttons there are comm "
A,Elicit,"okay ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's good . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we just take that one . "
A,Elicit,"And what else comm we have "
B,Elicit,"Also the one in the dark . "
B,Minor,"So uh "
B,Elicit,"It lights up when it's dark ? "
A,Other,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"I didn't "
A,Minor,"but it's "
A,Task,"Oh th I thought would comm that that would be the same . "
A,Task,"If you push something comm it it all lights up . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"but um "
D,Task,"it it mustn't work all the time . "
B,Task,"Yes comm that's what I mean . "
D,Task,"It uh uh it have to work only when you use it . "
D,Minor,"So if you "
A,Task,"Or you can switch it on or something . "
D,Task,"No comm "
B,Minor,"Or maybe when you "
D,Task,"if you use one button comm it must turn uh on for twenty seconds comm and then it must turn off . "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"It lights up all . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
A,Minor,"You have to "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
A,Task,"That's what I said . "
B,Other,"Okay yeah . "
A,Task,"It's the same as the telephone . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"D "
B,Task,"Yeah comm alright . Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"And do we use a a Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac comm if you can look through it . "
A,Elicit,"Or just a normal remote control . "
B,Task,"Maybe just as an option comm w like we discussed comm like iPod . "
C,Task,"Mm comm maybe it's a good idea . "
B,Task,"Different colours comm "
B,Task,"uh maybe use even different fonts . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Oh yeah . "
B,Task,"Like uh phones . "
A,Other,"Different colours . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"so y you just make it th through You look through it ? "
C,Task,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"A see-through . Mm comm that's cool . "
B,Task,"Yeah . Uh as an option maybe . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And so the buttons we have comm "
A,Task,"this is comm yeah comm this is normal . "
A,Task,"We put in the the simple buttons on the top comm "
B,Task,"It's the standard "
A,Task,"and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm uh "
D,Task,"But you have You had a lot of different buttons . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"we but we don't We don't really have any complicated buttons . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"maybe you have you have to "
