A,Other,"Wouldn't wanna be Project Manager . "
A,Other,"Uh comm what we going to do . "
A,Other,"Um comm once again I'm uh gonna take minutes . "
A,Task,"So comm um no presentation for me . "
A,Task,"Uh comm first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_ . "
B,Other,"Yo . "
D,Task,"J_ and J_ . "
A,Task,"Afterwards some uh "
A,Minor,"eval eval evalu "
C,Task,"Evaluation . "
D,Task,"Evaluation . "
B,Task,"Evaluation criteria . "
A,Task,"evaluation "
A,Other,"s sorry . "
A,Task,"Uh evaluation crit criteria . "
A,Task,"Uh comm in combination with the finance I um uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"which we have to fill in later on . "
A,Other,"Um comm you see . "
A,Task,"Uh comm and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro . "
D,Other,"Hmm . Interesting . "
D,Task,"Ah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"So comm that's uh that's a big "
B,Other,"Oops . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
C,Task,"Mm-hmm . That's gonna be t problem . "
A,Minor,"l so let's uh wait it uh um "
B,Minor,"Some creative uh "
A,Minor,"we have we have must uh comm "
A,Task,"we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh yeah comm quite a lot of mathematics . "
B,Minor,"Oh . Yeah . "
A,Task,"And after that comm uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard comm with the with our laptops comm with the all uh all this . "
A,Task,"And uh afterwards comm uh we closing . "
A,Task,"Once again comm forty minutes comm "
A,Task,"so uh let's start . "
B,Minor,"Ok okay . "
A,Task,"I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation . "
B,Other,"Shall I give a short introduction and then uh "
C,Task,"Yeah comm well sure . "
D,Task,"J_ and J_ . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"J_ and J_ . "
D,Other,"Jane and Jane . "
B,Other,"J_ and J_ comm okay . "
D,Task,"'Kay guys comm take it away . "
C,Other,"Hi . "
B,Other,"Take it away . "
B,Task,"Um comm this was our first concept . "
B,Task,"We decided to use a single touch-screen . "
B,Task,"So comm we've worked out this concepts comm "
B,Task,"how to how to hold it comm where to put the buttons and and stuff . "
B,Task,"And um comm well comm we began with uh with a form of shape comm that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand comm left or right handed . "
B,Task,"So comm we made i it a little bit less thick "
B,Task,"and uh it has some ar artistic meaning . "
B,Other,"No ? "
B,Task,"This uh isn't nothing . "
B,Task,"Idea maybe uh is better . "
B,Task,"Um well comm during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top comm usable with your thumb comm "
B,Task,"and uh the menu structure comm uh if necessary comm with your other hand comm "
B,Task,"so it's just gonna hold it easily . "
B,Task,"And it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too comm of course . "
B,Task,"So we began uh working out a concept . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm uh well comm and as you saw comm we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen . "
C,Task,"Well comm these would be the main buttons comm "
C,Task,"h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to . "
C,Task,"But comm well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up . "
C,Task,"We have the more advanced menu uh setting right here . "
C,Task,"We have the sub-menus and stu stuff . "
C,Task,"We made a top oh comm or a front view . "
C,Task,"Just so like you wanna uh back view . "
C,Task,"As you can see comm this uh there comm there are uh two uh weird bumps in it . "
C,Task,"This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic . "
C,Task,"And uh this is for the artistic effect . "
C,Other,"Well comm what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture later on "
C,Task,"you have more b a better idea after that . "
C,Task,"But comm idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh with these two . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"And so when you put it on the table comm it will just lay down . "
C,Task,"It won't uh roll around or stuff . "
C,Task,"But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe comm "
C,Task,"or like these old uh phones . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Y you you may get the idea . "
C,Task,"So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be . "
C,Task,"The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers comm "
C,Task,"like we discussed early on . "
C,Task,"Uh comm you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel comm but more fluidly and round . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"the panel just uh of course goes like this . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"No comm okay . "
C,Task,"And uh comm in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics "
C,Minor,"uh that would "
C,Task,"you can make a more thinner uh design comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"and that would actually look very nice comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"And uh comm about the colour comm what have "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Oh comm we added that this um can be held with your hands for this "
B,Task,"maximum is om yeah comm one and a half centimetres . "
B,Task,"So comm you have room here for your battery "
B,Task,"and maybe even other um electronic chips . "
B,Task,"S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Elicit,"Yeah comm f uh comm as colours comm do you do you have the picture in uh "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Oh yeah . "
C,Task,"Now comm well this is the idea about uh the bumps . "
C,Task,"Uh comm you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior . "
C,Minor,"It uh "
C,Task,"you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us . "
D,Minor,"'S l "
D,Task,"it's like an uh Easter egg . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's like an e but this is for children . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We we want a more adult version . "
C,Task,"But comm this is like a remote control for children . "
A,Other,"It's called a weemote "
C,Other,". A weemote . "
D,Other,"Weemote . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Weemote . "
C,Other,"Hey comm that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm but "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Wait what I w got in mind . "
C,Task,"So this actually basic the idea . "
C,Task,"We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I can imagine that . "
C,Task,"And and for colours comm we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey . "
C,Task,"Those are the technological colours actually comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"so it d "
B,Task,"It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable comm "
B,Task,"so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple comm "
C,Task,"Or blue or whatever . "
B,Task,"but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control comm it would be less appealing than a white one . "
B,Task,"And young people comm we think comm are a little bit more flexible comm "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"they think comm ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover comm so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"um I think a cover is necessary comm "
B,Task,"'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"So comm there must be some cheap standard cover comm "
D,Minor,"Hmm . Mm . "
B,Task,"um maybe white or something comm "
B,Task,"that's could comes with it and you can buy comm "
B,Task,"so we can make extra money . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people . "
D,Minor,"Oui okay . "
A,Task,"Uh comm we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it comm "
A,Task,"uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard comm "
B,Task,"The other way around comm you mean . "
C,Task,"Oh yeah . "
A,Task,"and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated comm more traditional look comm they're willing to pay uh that . "
B,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"They want uh they want more luxury stuff comm "
A,Task,"but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So comm maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm maybe yeah comm perhaps you're right . "
C,Task,"Uh comm I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical . "
B,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
D,Other,"An another idea . "
D,Task,"Uh comm maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"They'll please the elder users as well . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well yeah comm "
B,Minor,"a colour of "
B,Task,"a wood style comm a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Nah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour comm but not too not too much . "
D,Task,"Not not too uh yeah . "
B,Task,"This is banana and mango comm not not purple or p orange and yellow . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm exactly . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But comm the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Or blue or "
A,Task,"Not too comm but w a little comm "
B,Minor,"Ah . Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"because that's our aim . "
C,Task,"li like like this like this . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"This isn't this isn't too much comm is it ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . No . Yeah . "
C,Minor,"I f "
D,Minor,". "
A,Task,"Well comm the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of "
D,Task,"Well I I I think so . "
C,Task,"Yeah . The buttons comm "
C,Minor,"I "
D,Task,"Yeah comm except for the buttons it's it could be a standard model . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"It "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"uh something like this would be nice . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay comm that's that's it from us . "
A,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Task,"'Kay comm it's my time now . "
B,Other,"It's my turn . "
A,Task,"The Marketing Expert . "
C,Other,"Uh-oh . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"During the "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"During the design uh design life-cycle we uh "
A,Other,"Sorry . "
D,Task,"we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff . "
D,Task,"Um comm now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements . "
D,Task,"So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . "
D,Task,"Um comm we're going to do that with a seven point scale . "
D,Other,"Opening a Word document now . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"One "
D,Other,"oh comm okay comm uh I have to expla explain something . "
D,Task,"We have to uh be consensive about about things . "
D,Task,"So comm it has to be a group uh group decision . "
D,Elicit,"Okay ? "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"so we gon we gonna evaluate the "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"We're going to vote . "
D,Minor,"We "
D,Task,"yeah ? The prototype . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah comm the the thing we saw . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm just saw . "
D,Task,"Okay comm one . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control is designed for people with age below forty . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Seven ? "
D,Task,"Seven is false . "
A,Task,"Uh comm true . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah comm b one or "
A,Other,"Sorry . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm one I think . "
D,Elicit,"Most true ? "
C,Elicit,"Why ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty . It's also designed for people above forty . "
B,Other,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Elicit,"so a o one is appropriate ? "
C,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"Or comm more like a four . "
B,Task,"No no comm a little more in the middle . "
B,Task,"No comm "
C,Minor,"I have "
D,Elicit,"Three . "
B,Task,"uh three or yeah . "
C,Minor,"I've "
C,Task,"Yeah comm two or three comm "
C,Minor,"because it's not just "
C,Task,"uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"But it's also designed for people of age above forty . So comm "
D,Task,"Ah comm exactly . "
D,Task,"Exactly . "
C,Task,"I'll say it's about three . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"it will be primary appealing to to m minus forty comm but also appealing to "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Three . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But also for yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"Uh comm second . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control is beautiful . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"It's "
B,Task,"Wow . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"acco according to us comm it's one ? Or "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I I think "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"it's the marketing uh angle on television . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"p s "
B,Task,"We have a wonderful "
D,Task,"Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well comm it's also fancy then . "
D,Task,"Three . "
D,Elicit,"Uh comm the remote control looks fancy . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"One ? "
B,Task,"Of course . We have a perfect remote . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Good . "
D,Task,"Four . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control has big comm clear channel switching buttons . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah comm "
B,Task,"oh they have to agree but "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yes . "
C,Other,"Leads to user face comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Daniel . "
B,Task,"I'm the User Interface uh Expert . "
D,Elicit,"Uh comm teletext buttons and volume buttons ? "
B,Task,"Um comm uh no . "
A,Task,"No teletext buttons . "
A,Task,"Teletext is in the menu . "
B,Task,"You you've different menu . "
D,Elicit,"False ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm false . "
B,Minor,"And volume is impo "
D,Elicit,"And volume ? "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Volume is true . "
D,Task,"True . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm hmm . "
D,Elicit,"Big and clear ? "
C,Task,"Yeah comm the they are big and clear . . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah comm big and clear . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm big and clear . "
B,Task,"But you could make a teletext button uh six . "
D,Minor,"Hey . "
B,Task,"Otherwise comm the people who read this uh are gonna think we have no teletext button . "
D,Minor,"Hey . "
D,Minor,"Hide . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but but the teletext button . Yeah comm you can ch That's in a menu . "
D,Minor,"It's it's not "
C,Minor,"So comm it's w yeah comm it it it "
D,Task,"yeah comm it "
C,Task,"it isn't entirely unclear comm "
D,Minor,"J "
C,Minor,"but "
C,Task,"So comm I wouldn't give it a seven . "
C,Task,"I would give it a more a five or a six . "
B,Minor,"No . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Five ? "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh comm I don I don't know . "
C,Elicit,"What do you think comm uh Mister Project Manager ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"it's it's yeah . "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay . Well comm I agree . "
A,Task,"I was thinking very black and white . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Black and red . "
A,Other,"Thank you J_ . "
D,Minor,"Red . "
B,Task,"Okay comm don't forget to save it . Uh "
D,Other,"Okay . Volume . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control is easy to be found . "
B,Task,"Uh well comm when we put in fancy colours comm yeah "
B,Minor,"and "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Fruity . "
C,Minor,"So comm if you so if you have trouble finding it "
B,Task,"But comm um it it's not making any sound uh comm "
B,Elicit,"have we deciding ? "
D,Task,"Oh comm okay comm "
D,Minor,"but "
B,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed comm or you throw this remote control under your bed comm is it better findable ? "
B,Task,"It'll make a difference . "
B,Task,"We have the better re "
B,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
B,Task,"My remote control's black . "
D,Elicit,"A li little bit maybe ? "
B,Task,"A little bit comm but yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well comm we p we can do it glow in the dark . "
D,Elicit,"Four ? "
B,Minor,"Uh "
D,Minor,"Fi "
A,Task,"So comm if it's in the dark place comm you still see it glowing . "
D,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"K yeah . "
B,Minor,"Fo fo yeah fo five is . "
D,Task,"Ah comm I I I think five . "
D,Minor,"It's it's it doesn't really make a lot of "
C,Task,"Well comm then uh then I'll go for four . "
D,Elicit,"Four ? "
C,Task,"Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm you're right . "
C,Minor,"Uh comm "
A,Minor,"I think "
C,Task,"so I'll I'll go for four . "
D,Task,"Yes comm but five is between four and six . "
A,Minor,"Ah comm you must see it as "
A,Task,"uh comm w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls comm there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room comm this one will stand out comm I think . "
C,Minor,"Wha "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"B_ . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that that's a better question actually . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"it it's "
A,Minor,"Exa "
A,Task,"I think that that's what it's about . "
B,Task,"If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer comm uh you find it comm yeah ? "
A,Minor,"If it "
A,Task,"if this lying on your couch comm you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm that's stupid . "
D,Task,"Like comm no not uh not seeing it comm but lost it in the house or something . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Uh comm but when you lost it you're just not "
D,Minor,"But comm okay . "
C,Task,"Well comm if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere comm uh then you'd uh recognise it as comm whoa comm that is strange . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm mostly when you lose your remote control comm it it's under your "
A,Other,"That's our remote control . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . Yeah comm I I agree comm I agree . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Yeah comm what is that . Uh comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"so it's "
B,Task,"Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it . Uh "
D,Task,"Eight comm "
D,Elicit,"the remote control has fresh comm fruity colours . "
A,Task,"True . "
B,Task,"Um I would call uh choose two comm "
B,Task,"'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours comm as it would not . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm not too flashy . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control is made of soft material . "
B,Minor,"Um comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm rubber comm is kind of soft . "
B,Task,"kinda soft comm but but not this . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but not too soft we have decided . "
D,Elicit,"Three ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Three comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah yeah comm easy to use comm "
A,Task,"Easy to use . One . "
B,Minor,"very afford . "
D,Elicit,"Easy to use ? "
A,Elicit,"Yeah comm can it be zero ? "
C,Minor,"Well comm I don yeah comm it is kind of "
D,Elicit,"Top easy to use ? "
D,Task,"It's it's not the most easy to use "
C,Minor,"It "
B,Task,"No comm "
C,Task,"No . Uh "
B,Task,"you can do two comm because um "
D,Task,"It can be easier . "
B,Task,"it can be easier . "
C,Task,"It could yeah . "
D,Task,"Jus just with ten buttons comm that's the easiest . "
B,Minor,"But then you're l "
B,Task,"yeah comm but then you'll lose "
C,Task,"Functional ability . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"function f yeah comm functionality and our fancy uh look comm so . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but the most uh easy to use is just with one button "
B,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"It is r it is rather easy to use comm because you have the primary buttons always visible . "
D,Minor,"on t "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm but easy n not not the most easy to use comm I think . "
C,Minor,". "
C,Task,"No comm it's it I I'll go for two . "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"My vote's on two . "
D,Elicit,"Two ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm m mine too . "
A,Task,"Okay comm two . Yeah comm two . "
D,Task,"We also have to compare it to the uh to the remote controls on the market nowadays . So "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but waits just a minutes . "
B,Other,"Inspiration . "
A,Task,"What's the time ? "
A,Task,"We also have uh to do the evaluation comm uh the production costs and uh stuff . "
B,Task,"These are the m regular remotes . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah comm "
D,Other,"I'm uh hurrying . "
D,Task,"Okay comm eleven . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control is innovative . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes comm true comm one . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
D,Minor,"A very "
A,Elicit,"You're agree comm Tim ? "
D,Task,"of course . "
A,Elicit,"You haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh Paris ? "
D,Elicit,"The remote control has m remova removable from Multilux . "
B,Task,"Yes comm one . "
B,Task,"Very multifunctional . "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control comm i it has speech recognition . "
D,Task,"False . "
C,Task,"Yes comm "
A,Task,"False . "
C,Minor,"it "
B,Task,"This is used with speech recognition comm this . "
D,Elicit,"The remote control has built-in games ? "
B,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"But uh comm maybe make it two comm because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh it's not an entire game . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but they are built in comm so it's one . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm they are built in . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
C,Minor,"Not down . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"And the last comm paren parental advisory function . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"You really like the parental advisory . "
A,Other,"Freak . "
D,Task,"Yes comm I do . "
B,Elicit,"Th did you make this or the "
C,Minor,"Bu "
D,Task,"Save as . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm he made it . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"It changes it maybe . "
D,Other,"Okay comm I will uh "
B,Task,"Oh yay . "
D,Other,"do the the math . "
B,Task,"Oh dear . "
D,Task,"Now it's your turn . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Other,"thank you . "
A,Other,"We'll see . "
B,Other,"Hmm ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost . "
A,Task,"If it's under uh twelve and half Euro comm then it's uh ok uh okay . "
A,Minor,"But i is it if it is b "
A,Task,"Huh ? "
A,Task,"No comm this isn't right . "
A,Other,"Okay so comm . Redesign . "
B,Task,"If they're under twelve fifty . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah comm if they under Yeah . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah . Yeah comm it's "
B,Task,"Yeah ? Cau 'cause so it's okay . "
A,Other,"sorry . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro comm uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation comm as we have uh experienced it . "
A,Task,"Otherwise comm we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy . So "
A,Task,"Uh comm we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components . "
A,Task,"We have to uh fil uh comm want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro . "
A,Elicit,"So comm do we have uh a hand dynamo ? "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"That's zero . "
C,Minor,"Me comm too . "
B,Task,"Battery comm yes . One . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"Battery comm one ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"One comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Kinetic comm one . "
A,Elicit,"Kinetic comm one ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm solar cells comm zero . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Okay comm uh simple chip on print ? "
C,Task,"Uh comm n no . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"No ? "
D,Task,"Advanced chip . "
C,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No comm advanced chip . "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Minor,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"Sample sensor sample speaker ? "
B,Task,"No comm the advanced chip is uh "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"Advanced chip is three . "
A,Elicit,"Three ? "
D,Task,"Three Euros comm yep . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Uh comm we have one . We have one "
A,Task,"Yeah uh comm but it it's one one thing comm it's three Euro . "
D,Task,"Okay comm one piece comm yeah . "
C,Minor,". "
C,Task,"No comm sev zero . "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm what's the sample sensor ? "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Well comm that's um "
D,Task,"Speech recognition comm I think . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"yeah comm speech recognition "
B,Task,"you give it a sample comm uh one . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"and s "
A,Task,"Zero . "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm uncurved flat . "
B,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"A zero . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Elicit,"But is it s it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then uh and then uh "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"You "
B,Task,"no . "
C,Task,"No . No . "
D,Other,"Thingy . "
A,Task,"no ? Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So it's only uh once double-curved . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yes comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"'cause um the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the uh the back of the "
D,Task,"three . "
D,Task,"Eight . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We're now in a problem comm 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet . "
B,Task,"Uh comm we don't have anything else . So "
D,Task,"Okay comm go on . Just go on . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"but uh we have "
C,Task,"Just go on . "
C,Task,"Then we'll see uh we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Could you step a little to the right ma "
D,Task,"Two . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Oh comm sorry . "
D,Task,"Two . "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm rubber . "
B,Minor,"Or "
A,Minor,"You . "
C,Task,"Zero . "
B,Task,"And zero . "
A,Elicit,"Titanium comm no ? "
B,Elicit,"Special uh is the special colour ? "
A,Elicit,"Special colour ? "
B,Other,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I don't think so . "
C,Task,"No comm this is a standard colour . "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Yes comm this is a special colour . "
D,Minor,"S "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but we want to make uh the wood colours comm uh that uh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm if if you're honest comm we'll uh type one comm special colour . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm but but D but Daniel comm tha that's that's another brand . "
C,Task,"That's an add-on . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm one . "
D,Task,"That's another article "
D,Task,"to sell . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but we we going to "
A,Task,"yeah yeah comm that's true . "
A,Minor,"But yeah comm it's it's it "
B,Task,"Uh comm j maybe we'll finish uh the the list first and then look back comm aye ? "
D,Task,"That doesn't account for this . Producing this . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"the push-button comm no . "
B,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Scroll wheel comm no . "
A,Task,"Scroll-wheel comm no . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Oh comm no . "
A,Task,"Yes comm one . "
B,Task,"One comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Uh comm button comm no . "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"No . "
A,Minor,"No comm the the "
B,Task,"Mm comm is it "
A,Elicit,"we don't have a s "
C,Task,"These three . "
B,Task,"No . No . "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Well comm we're only four Euro over budget . "
A,Task,"no . Okay . "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
B,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"But "
A,Elicit,"So comm um what's the thing we can change ? "
B,Task,"No . No . "
C,Task,"Well comm other case comm we can make it single-curved or uncurved . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Uh comm can I uh I say something ? "
B,Task,"Mm comm single-curves . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
A,Other,"No comm can I say something uh as Project Manager ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Just cut off the kine "
A,Task,"The kinetic thing comm can we just skip it comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"because uh you have to shake it comm but that's not really innovative . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Okay comm sure . "
B,Minor,"Or "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"we just put a good battery it it . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mobile phones nowadays . "
D,Other,"Daniel . Daniel comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Yo . "
D,Minor,"what do you think about Here . "
A,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Other,"yeah comm yes . "
D,Task,"What do you think about uh putting a battery in it comm but also selling like uh the covers comm a docking station "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"just apart from the from the thing comm so that you can uh put uh "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"rechargeable batteries in it and just "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway comm just you s you have to recharge them manual . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm and not really . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"But we "
A,Task,"if you forget about the kinetic comm "
D,Task,"Just an idea . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"that's a cost reduc "
A,Task,"well if we do that comm "
A,Task,"we shall . "
B,Minor,"Ah . "
C,Task,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . "
A,Minor,"So um "
D,Task,"Yeah comm of course . "
C,Task,"And that would solve the budget problem . "
A,Task,"Uh comm b but i but the single-curved is just oh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"so we have to bake the ba back flat comm and then "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"It's just yeah well comm the single-curve that "
B,Task,"No comm it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think . Or "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay comm okay . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Exactly comm yeah . "
A,Task,"So that's wh tha that's one option . "
B,Elicit,"Or are these two curves ? Uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And then w yeah comm and then we could have it comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"but what else uh do we have to cut out ? "
C,Minor,"We going to cut "
B,Task,"No advanced chip comm uh that's a little bit of problem . "
A,Task,"No comm tho uh that that can be done . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So uh comm "
B,Elicit,"Although comm can we make it with a regular chip ? "
A,Task,"okay comm a little less uh conversation . "
B,Minor,"Curvy . "
D,Elicit,"Hey comm those ar arcs comm why are there for ? "
A,Other,"Sorry ? "
D,Task,"The blue blue uh "
A,Minor,"Fill in "
A,Task,"Just a "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Explanation . "
A,Task,"explanation . "
B,Task,"Twelve fifty . "
A,Other,"I can delete it for you if you want . "
B,Minor,"Well "
D,Task,"No comm no no . "
A,Task,"So comm if we do this comm uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro . "
A,Task,"And we're done . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Elicit,"but does it fit with our design ? "
B,Elicit,"Do we have to u adapt it ? "
A,Task,"Uh well comm the only uh thing that don't "
B,Task,"It's single-curves . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm single-curved comm but there's a curve in it . So "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"W "
B,Task,"Could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back comm and then we're uh has "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we just make it flat . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"But comm wha 'Kay comm look comm "
C,Minor,"But comm you do l "
D,Minor,"what is the uh "
D,Task,"If you make it double-curved comm it costs one Euro more . "
B,Task,"More . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"But "
B,Task,"You make it optional . "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Elicit,"but does it have a lot of extra uh "
C,Elicit,"Function . "
B,Task,"Functional . "
D,Elicit,"fun function more like "
C,Elicit,"Worth comm does it have added worth ? "
B,Task,"Uh comm there's an a a athe aesthetic value comm but not functionality . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"No comm um "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's really a static value . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm uh aesthetic . "
D,Task,"I mean comm uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half . "
D,Task,"But I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm well let's assume it is . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it is . Oh . "
D,Task,"No comm we can't go above that . "
D,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
C,Task,"We we should assume it i that it is . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . Then it's okay . "
C,Task,"But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . "
C,Task,"R if you uh promote a kinetic um I kinetic remote control comm I mean comm that would b sell better than an a normal remote control . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Do you think ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I think so . "
A,Task,"Well comm now you can shake your remote control . "
C,Task,"No comm well comm y I mean uh comm y you can go into your neighbour and tell him comm ha comm my k uh remote control is kinetic . "
A,Minor,"Kinetic . "
C,Task,"You have standard old battery control uh remote con "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"What a what about all the m the environment freaks ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Not freaks comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile . So "
D,Minor,"the envi "
D,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"True . "
D,Task,"I I think it's it's "
D,Task,"It look like this one . "
B,Task,"You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Minor,"Who "
A,Task,"because if you want to go to kinetic comm you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat comm "
A,Task,"and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"thing . "
A,Task,"And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve comm "
A,Minor,"then it's uh then it's uh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm just one big curve . "
A,Task,"yeah comm one big good curve . "
A,Task,"I was going to uh say nasty words comm but I don't . "
A,Task,"This is strange by the way . "
A,Task,"Wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber . "
A,Task,"We thought that wood would be more expensive . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh comm this uh American figures . "
B,Task,"You just cut down some trees . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm maybe . "
A,Minor,"But uh that "
A,Elicit,"this is this is it ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . Okay comm this is it . "
D,Task,"This is it . "
B,Task,"Whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium . "
A,Other,"I'm gonna save it . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"It is possible comm but you can't use double uh curves for titanium . "
B,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"That's one of the functionability uh "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well comm "
A,Minor,"considering we have "
D,Other,"Ah no comm we have to do all those hours again . "
D,Task,"Go back . "
D,Task,"One back ? "
D,Task,"Costs on uh No redesign . "
A,Task,"Well comm we were above comm so we did a little redesign "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"We sue . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay comm yeah . "
B,Other,"We Yeah comm we'll start her all o all over again . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm um "
A,Task,"now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project . "
A,Task,"Uh comm some uh things . "
A,Minor,"Were there uh room for uh "
A,Elicit,"was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ? "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"I I didn't think so . That there was a lot of room for it . "
D,Task,"But comm that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there comm "
D,Task,"and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . Bu "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"That's true . I agree with that . "
C,Task,"Well comm I th I think you two comm uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel comm you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . That's true . "
B,Task,"For us comm there was a lot of creativity . "
C,Minor,"'Cause I think m "
B,Task,"We could just sign up an uh remote if we liked . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
C,Task,"I think Jeroen and I comm we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm that's true . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Uh how about the leadership ? "
B,Minor,"Uh "
D,Other,"Leadership was uh crappy . "
C,Other,"Ha . "
B,Task,"Crappy . Cra "
C,Other,"Nah comm the leadership wasn't crappy comm it was the leader that was crappy . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Nah . No comm "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Okay comm thank you very much . "
C,Task,"the leadership was okay . "
A,Other,"Now we're done . "
B,Other,"Yeah comm example of crappy leadershi "
D,Task,"No comm leadership was uh "
B,Task,"Okay comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm it was good . "
D,Task,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
D,Minor,"Uh comm you could have "
D,Task,"but uh comm it was your first comm "
D,Other,"no uh no disrespect or something comm "
D,Task,"but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more . "
D,Task,"So like comm I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting comm and "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"You could of said comm shut up you fool . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . I notice it too . "
D,Minor,"But "
A,Task,"I was a I was also very uh unhappy comm uh very unsatisfied uh about the "
D,Other,"About me . "
A,Task,"about the first meeting . "
A,Task,"So comm uh I hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you made up . "
C,Other,"Try to learn from your mistake . And we will never do it again . "
A,Task,"get better "
A,Task,"and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk "
D,Task,"No comm it you did better . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm more more consensus . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Ev everybody w was agreeing every "
A,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Much more constructive . "
A,Task,"Okay comm so uh that's cool . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm teamwork ? "
A,Task,"Well comm maybe that's uh only "
A,Task,"Yeah well comm it's for us comm because uh "
B,Task,"Well comm we work together on a project comm but everybody has his own task . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah "
B,Minor,"So comm it is a little bit "
A,Task,"and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . "
B,Task,"Yeah . No "
A,Task,"But comm really teamwork were you two uh "
D,Task,"Two guys . "
B,Task,"Well comm it went okay . "
A,Minor,"The "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that went w it went well . "
C,Minor,"It's it's just uh "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
A,Elicit,"No hard feelings . "
B,Task,"Stupid stupid pen comm but uh "
C,Task,"Nah . Yeah comm we we had some trouble with the pen comm but "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Now you you must push a little while . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"but but draw something uh difficult . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm but us "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"D uh just write your name right now . "
B,Task,"Try to write your name comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"in in writing letters comm of course comm yeah ? "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm normally comm uh this uh "
B,Task,"the w Block letter sign it comm yeah ? "
A,Minor,"O Just uh "
B,Task,"Just just write your name in in one line . "
A,Other,"okay . "
B,Minor,"If it's a little bit too small "
B,Task,"bit quicker now . "
B,Minor,"It didn't "
A,Task,"You can be you can go quicker comm 'cause then it it won't notice it . "
B,Task,"Uh he he knows how it works comm yeah . "
A,Task,"I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard comm "
C,Task,"Oh . "
A,Task,"so I think that's the that's the main issue . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um comm so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with comm "
D,Other,"Means . "
B,Task,"Y well comm yeah . "
A,Elicit,"um the the the the digital pen . "
B,Minor,"Th the i "
B,Task,"The idea is great comm but it doesn't work properly . Uh "
A,Task,"Okay . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Digital pen comm I thought uh th the first time I did individual work comm I used it . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"But comm a and the first two meetings I brought it with me comm "
D,Task,"but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting . "
A,Minor,"No . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"No comm I have it working . "
C,Minor,"But comm uh yeah comm well uh "
D,Task,"It's it's not real real use for me . "
C,Task,"No comm it doesn't have that much added value to the "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Task,"Nee . "
A,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"As uh as I said a m a c few moments ago comm it I would like comm myself comm to write with a normal pen comm "
B,Task,"because must um "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's almost the same concept comm but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I it's the same concept as the pen comm where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow . "
A,Minor,"M yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh Word . "
B,Task,"Yes . No comm and it doesn't give any added value . "
A,Task,"No comm uh that's true . No . "
D,Task,"Not really comm no . "
A,Task,"And uh the SMARTboard is uh useful comm "
A,Task,"but the the pen is I uh not user-friendly comm I think . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm not user-friendly . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things comm "
B,Task,"Yeah comm and it's it's not very precise . "
A,Minor,"and that's the "
B,Minor,"We're trying to m to "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"like when you do this . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm it may um "
B,Task,"Yeah comm and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Smaller . "
D,Elicit,"Smaller ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm smaller . "
B,Task,"Just like when you're writing on a letter . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but that's not th the the you "
A,Task,"when you at a foreign audience comm you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small . "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"a as you saw on on this drawing comm just open open this one or that one . "
B,Minor,"It's uh th it it "
B,Task,"Yeah comm uh we had more problems even here "
B,Task,"when we trying to draw these buttons comm it's almost impossible to get clear uh when you're uh "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Oh . Sorry . "
A,Task,"But maybe there's some function with "
A,Task,"no comm it isn't . "
A,Minor,"With uh "
B,Task,"And the eraser was another problem . "
B,Task,"It w t is is this large . "
B,Task,"And when you try to erase this line comm y "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Well comm I'm gonna erase my uh name . "
B,Other,"I'm gonna erase my name there . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm it's a big uh big eraser . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"New ideas ? "
B,Elicit,"M Abo What kind of new ideas ? "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Task,"Well comm the the idea of the touch-screen is uh "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm uh "
D,Other,"Do you ? "
D,Task,"Go on . "
A,Minor,"I'm just uh "
B,Elicit,"New ideas about uh the working of this software comm about about the project comm about the remote controls or "
D,Task,"Yeah . Mm comm yeah comm I think so . "
A,Task,"I don't know what what I mean . "
B,Other,"Hello . "
D,Elicit,"Did you heard what he said ? "
D,Task,"I don't "
A,Minor,"No . "
C,Task,"Know what I mean . "
D,Task,"I don't know what I mean . "
D,Task,"Oh comm I have some figure . "
D,Task,"Here . "
D,Task,"The eva the evaluation comm "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah . "
D,Task,"the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six . "
A,Task,"That's interesting . "
D,Task,"So that's fairly uh fairly good comm I think . "
A,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"because what does it mean ? "
B,Task,"So true . "
D,Minor,"Uh comm that uh "
A,Task,"All the mo yeah comm are between one and two . "
D,Task,"all the requirements uh are true or very true comm right . Yep . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Oh comm okay . Yeah comm okay . "
A,Other,"Thank you comm expert . "
A,Elicit,"But the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software ? "
B,Task,"Not really comm just they have to improve it . "
A,Task,"Not really comm yeah ? "
B,Task,"Uh comm the concept is okay comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think "
B,Task,"but it has to be quicker . "
B,Task,"Uh comm it is still opening my programme comm "
B,Task,"n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and it comm yeah comm just takes too many time . "
B,Task,"People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it comm and "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You had expected it to to be uh more more uh "
B,Task,"More user-friendly . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"'Cause when you use a pen comm you can just draw like you d draw normally comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"and you do "
D,Task,"May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And draw it comm and it's it's placed over there . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm that l "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Would be easier . "
B,Task,"Or at least when you you don't have to adapt to the technology comm "
B,Task,"just you can write in the way you normally write . "
D,Minor,"Hmm ? No . "
B,Task,"And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen . "
B,Task,"And that's a very bad concept . "
A,Minor,"Yep comm yep . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
D,Task,"Ah comm very bad . "
B,Minor,"Nah comm okay comm I I it's my opinion that I "
D,Minor,"But "
D,Task,"I think this is better than regular flip-overs comm "
D,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's can be saved easier . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But if you're in normal flip-over you a lot of people write text . "
B,Task,"There's no text option . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And writing text uh comm yeah comm you've gotta really do your best to write some "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"and and maybe some uh functions for uh uh uh circle or uh a square . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You have to draw it yourself now . "
B,Task,"Or maybe even insert picture . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"If you have uh some presentation comm and you have some f "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Or text function . "
C,Task,"Just t t type text comm and that that would be uh excellent . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mean "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Elicit,"but insert image isn't available ? "
B,Minor,"'Cause then you could "
D,Task,"Here . Picture from scanner comm clip-art . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that that can be done already . "
B,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
A,Task,"But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh "
B,Minor,"So you can "
D,Elicit,"Hyperlink ? "

D,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Well comm that's nice . "
B,Minor,"There's one way to uh "
A,Elicit,"Is it "
D,Task,"'Kay comm double-click it . "
B,Task,"Maybe if if you're not using the eraser "
A,Other,"Here . oh . "
D,Task,"You're erasing . "
A,Other,"Oh comm sorry . "
B,Task,"Something else th "
B,Task,"Yeah comm arrow . "
D,Task,"Double-click it . "
A,Task,"Yeah . Here comm that . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Well comm it's "
A,Minor,"So you have "
A,Task,"as you saw comm you have a little uh "
A,Minor,"Oh comm you can "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"thank you . "
A,Task,"You can go uh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Task,"there . "
A,Task,"So there the the the functionality is there comm "
A,Task,"but it's not it's not ideal comm "
B,Minor,"But "
A,Minor,"and it's it's very "
B,Minor,". "
A,Task,"it costs a lot of time to uh "
B,Task,"To use comm yeah . "
A,Task,"to use . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"And that's a pity comm "
A,Task,"if you uh if you have uh thirty comm forty minutes uh for this kind of things comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"And that's m "
A,Task,"and we are now with four people comm "
A,Minor,"but it "
A,Task,"well comm imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone uh "
B,Task,"That's mostly the case comm "
B,Task,"from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case comm "
B,Task,"and if you have to do all this kind "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Two minutes of drawing comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"You'll rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there comm just use a flip-board . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"What I really miss also is uh "
D,Other,"is a d is a turtle "
D,Task,"is a decision uh decision system "
D,Task,"like um "
D,Task,"With the evaluation comm you have to Polls like comm what do you want comm a one comm a two comm "
A,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"maybe a a l a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write comm also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm j ju ju yeah comm v voting application . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"Just a little group group decision application . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But uh comm problem is comm well you can't discuss anything "
C,Task,"well you you ca uh you can comm "
C,Task,"but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"We I mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three . "
C,Task,"But comm well uh I we said uh comm no I w th think two comm because this and this comm "
C,Task,"and then you can react uh on it . "
C,Task,"But if you you put a three on it comm uh just figure well comm everybody knows what I'm knowing comm so they'll all just put a two on . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm of course . But comm uh you can still discuss about it comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm but it would yeah . "
D,Task,"but but click it in an application comm that's a lot easier to process . "
C,Task,"Yeah okay comm the for processing part . "
D,Task,"The digit . Yeah . "
C,Task,"But then uh comm I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it comm that uh isn't that bad idea comm actually . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Not that your opinion isn't valued comm but but still . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
