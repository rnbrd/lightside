D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"'Kay so we'll try to zip through this comm since we're short on time . "
A,Other,"Welcome everybody . "
A,Other,"Um hope your sessions went well . "
A,Task,"Um so this is our functional design meeting comm "
A,Task,"we're going to consider um user needs comm technical effects comm and the working design of our remote control . "
A,Task,"Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings comm "
A,Other,"and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder "
A,Task,"so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . "
A,Other,"Um I I'll get the ones up for next time comm "
A,Task,"um they're not finished yet . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Task,"Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked "
A,Task,"on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this "
D,Other,"And I can start if you want . Mm . "
A,Task,"sure . "
D,Elicit,"Is there an order ? "
D,Elicit,"No . "
D,Elicit,"We haven't decided on an order . "
A,Other,"Hm ? "
A,Task,"No comm any any order's fine . Yeah . "
D,Minor,"First . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm how do I put this "
B,Minor,"Just uh "
D,Other,"I'll just put the cable in . "
A,Task,"Oh yeah comm "
A,Other,"sorry . "
D,Elicit,"Is that it ? "
D,Elicit,"Can you see ? "
D,Task,"Oh comm here . Okay . "
D,Elicit,"So what happens it doesn't work ? "
A,Task,"It sh it takes a few seconds I think . "
B,Minor,"You may need to "
C,Elicit,"Who's that ? "
D,Task,"No . "
D,Elicit,"Is it in the right thing ? "
B,Minor,"But sometimes you have to do it "
B,Task,"it's like a three set setting cycle comm so press it a couple times comm hold down function and then press F_ eight . "
D,Other,"Oh wait comm um . "
D,Task,"Uh . You need to help me . "
A,Task,"Uh-huh comm and then press function . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and F_ eight . "
C,Task,"Could you just plug it back into hers "
C,Minor,"because she had "
D,Other,"Oh comm wait . "
D,Minor,"That's "
C,Unlab,"oh . "
D,Elicit,"is that it ? "
B,Minor,"Adjusting . "
A,Other,"Here we are . "
B,Task,"The cable might be a little loose or something . "
D,Task,"Right here we are . "
B,Task,"Oh comm you got it . "
A,Elicit,"Oh . Is it on ? "
D,Task,"We're here . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm um . "
D,Task,"In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found comm um "
D,Task,"a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory "
D,Minor,"through just their habits to n know "
D,Task,"their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . "
D,Task,"Um comm the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . "
D,Task,"Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look comm "
D,Task,"they don't like the way they feel comm "
D,Task,"they don't think they match their operating behaviour comm "
D,Task,"and an example is what we were talking about comm the buttons comm they only use ten per cent of the buttons comm "
D,Task,"so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most "
D,Task,"and I think we should design according to these buttons . "
D,Task,"Easy to lose comm and R_S_I_ . "
D,Task,"I don't know what R_S_I_ means . "
D,Task,"Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did comm I don't have a clue . "
A,Minor,"Hm . "
D,Task,"Um comm according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons comm I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . "
D,Task,"So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . "
D,Task,"They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . "
D,Minor,"And um "
D,Task,"yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently comm "
D,Task,"so this is the order . "
D,Task,"Channel selection comm teletext comm volume comm and power . "
D,Task,"The other ones are the settings comm and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour comm "
D,Task,"and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings comm "
D,Task,"and then comm just one comm "
D,Task,"and then from there go on to the audio on the screen comm either on the remote or on the television . "
D,Minor,"Um comm "
D,Task,"about the screen comm and speech recognition comm some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . "
D,Task,"And if we look at the market comm f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds comm "
D,Task,"I don't really know how to describe this comm "
D,Task,"um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product comm "
D,Task,"while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent comm "
D,Task,"so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . "
D,Task,"Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is comm "
D,Task,"but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um comm most likely comm "
D,Task,"but we should discuss this together . "
D,Task,"And that's all I have to say about the matter comm um . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
D,Minor,"Shall I "
D,Elicit,"what do I do ? "
D,Elicit,"Do I give this to someone else ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . Just move right on . "
C,Task,"Right . "
C,Other,"So get this . "
C,Elicit,"Okay so now I need to press F_ eight comm what is it ? "
A,Task,"Uh function F_ eight . "
D,Task,"Function F_ eight . "
C,Task,"'Kay . "
C,Elicit,"What's function ? "
A,Task,"It's the little blue w it's the one th "
C,Task,"Oh function comm I see it . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Other,"There we go . "
A,Minor,"Yeah should be "
A,Task,"It should be yeah . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Um . "
C,Task,"This my presentation about the uh technical functions design "
C,Task,"and I basically just tried to focus on um just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . "
C,Task,"So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet . "
C,Task,"And okay so basically um I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . "
C,Task,"Um so I think things like uh "
C,Task,"you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way comm "
C,Minor,"uh "
C,Task,"or um maybe that making 'em the same colour comm "
C,Task,"keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum comm "
C,Task,"and also things like is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough large enough "
C,Task,"I'm not sure we c "
C,Task,"I guess we would need to do some research about comm I would comm about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing comm "
C,Task,"um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . "
C,Task,"Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? "
C,Minor,"Um does it do "
C,Task,"or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? "
C,Task,"And then comm is it findable comm "
C,Task,"and uh how do we wanna do that ? "
C,Minor,"And um "
C,Task,"I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring comm "
C,Task,"um I dunno if this will work but "
C,Task,"And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . "
C,Task,"Just I mean I like the one on the right better comm just because it does have fewer buttons comm "
C,Task,"uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size comm shapes comm that sort of thing comm to best fit the user . "
C,Task,"That concludes my presentation . "
C,Task,"Okay . You need the little thingy . "
C,Other,"Ooh . "
B,Other,"How do I um "
D,Minor,"S "
D,Task,"That's on view . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"Okay so this is on the working design comm which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote comm "
B,Task,"um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . "
B,Task,"Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions comm "
B,Task,"the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . "
B,Task,"And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . "
B,Task,"So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote comm "
B,Task,"um input which would probably be buttons comm "
B,Task,"although um we just talked about voice recognition comm "
B,Task,"processor to take the information comm "
B,Task,"um something to transmit it to the T_V_ comm "
B,Task,"and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output comm like possibly a beep or a vibration . "
B,Task,"And also you need a sender for location signal comm "
B,Task,"which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . "
B,Task,"And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . "
B,Task,"Power comes from the battery comm goes to the chip comm "
B,Task,"um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb "
B,Task,"which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . "
B,Task,"And then for the location function comm you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal comm "
B,Task,"um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . "
B,Task,"That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it comm "
B,Task,"and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . "
B,Task,"Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh comm battery for the energy source comm "
B,Task,"that way you wouldn't have to plug it in comm "
B,Task,"um a button pad for input comm "
B,Task,"um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff comm "
B,Task,"I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ comm "
B,Task,"that's just sort of standard comm um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . "
B,Task,"Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it "
B,Task,"and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . "
B,Task,"So that concludes my presentation . "
A,Minor,"'Kay . "
C,Elicit,"Do you know about like "
C,Task,"I dunno comm you seem like you know about "
B,Other,"Mm ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm uh I d I was an engineer before I came here . "
C,Task,"Okay . Cool . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Well thank you everybody . "
A,Minor,"Um we have "
A,Task,"we'll discuss that "
A,Other,"and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . "
A,Task,"Um comm teletext is apparently outdated comm so due to internet popularity comm so that's off the list . Um comm "
A,Task,"also our remote should be used only for television comm um comm "
A,Task,"no extra internet kinda fancy things comm just the remote and the television . "
A,Task,"Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this comm "
A,Task,"so um the phrase is comm we put fashion in electronics comm "
A,Task,"so let's be fashionable I guess . "
A,Minor,"Um if we have something "
A,Task,"I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours comm "
A,Task,"so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw comm and yellow writing comm something like that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . Um . "
A,Task,"So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . "
A,Minor,"Um comm yeah . Do Let's "
A,Task,"I guess we should yeah make some "
A,Task,"kind of brainstorming comm "
C,Elicit,"Like in terms of "
A,Minor,"see what we can "
D,Elicit,"How it looks or "
C,Elicit,"how it looks comm or like what it does ? "
A,Minor,"wha what um "
A,Task,"well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"and I dunno the the s "
A,Task,"the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"Is our target group then people "
C,Elicit,"so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? "
C,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"I think that seems to yeah . Mm . "
B,Task,"It's easy to implement . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So the "
D,Elicit,"the the buzzer you mean comm "
C,Task,"yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"yeah comm for sure comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Locator . "
C,Task,"So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm teenagers and young professionals . "
C,Elicit,"what was it ? "
D,Task,"Well that's for speech recognition . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
B,Minor,"Well "
A,Other,"Oh comm uh . "
D,Task,"And screen . "
D,Task,"That's only for speech recognition and screen . "
B,Task,"I was thinking about that "
B,Task,"but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme comm "
B,Task,"and also comm if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking comm and if somebody says like one comm then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
B,Minor,"or "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"it seems like a silly comm "
D,Minor,"I mean "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I'm not sure how you would implement it . "
D,Task,"I just put the values in . "
A,Minor,"And if if you consider our budget comm it probably "
D,Minor,"But um the screen is the same as what comm "
B,Task,"It's a cool idea but "
A,Task,"if you consider our budget comm to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm I'm happy with that . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Completely . "
C,Minor,"Hu yeah . "
A,Minor,"Right so um yeah . "
C,Elicit,"Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself . "
B,Task,"Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place since the T_V_ already has power . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah you click the button comm it's gonna send out a signal comm "
B,Task,"and I was thinking comm I_R_ is line of sight comm so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work comm "
B,Task,"um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can "
B,Task,"It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote . "
A,Minor,"right . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
D,Elicit,"So do you plug it in the T_ you plug it in T_V_ comm this thing ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ "
B,Task,"so if you need to find the remote comm click the button . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"So it's now like a two-part thing . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm so it would be a two part package . "
C,Task,"Okay . Alright . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So we get to design that too . "
C,Task,"Make it fashionable . "
C,Minor,"Um comm okay . "
A,Elicit,"So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . "
B,Task,"Yeah I think so . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Just there . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the thing to put the you s "
D,Task,"you talking about a home for it . "
D,Elicit,"Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"or shall we leave that for now ? "
A,Task,"We probably leave that . "
A,Task,"I mean I guess one takes care of the other comm "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Then it can live anywhere . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"For the "
D,Task,"so you have that button comm "
D,Minor,"that so there's "
D,Elicit,"is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? "
B,Elicit,"Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ? "
D,Elicit,"Are we just having a radio ? "
D,Task,"On the phone . "
B,Task,"Um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me comm "
C,Minor,"T "
D,Task,"You don't need a light . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"I think that's what the phone has comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I mean when you need to find your phone comm you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . "
A,Task,"And like if the if the phone's under the couch comm you might not see the light comm so "
D,Task,"You can hear it's under the couch yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"So i Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Um comm "
D,Task,"So need the other buttons . "
D,Task,"So we have this mm . "
A,Task,"So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r "
A,Task,"I don't remember who showed them comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"That was that was me . "
A,Task,"yeah you you did um comm "
A,Minor,"they're "
A,Task,"I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing comm and the other looked like just television . "
C,Task,"I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . "
A,Task,"Oh really . "
C,Minor,"And uh "
A,Task,"'Cause that that is something we have to decide comm is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across international ? "
A,Task,"They're not no . "
D,Task,"They're not comm no . "
B,Task,"Okay comm so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s . "
C,Minor,"S "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's right comm yeah . "
D,Elicit,"It not V_H_S_ here ? "
A,Task,"But D_V_D_ probably is . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm other than that region and coding thing . "
C,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"But V_C_R_s "
A,Task,"And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers comm I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type comm that's the the technology these days . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm for sure . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"So . Okay comm "
C,Other,"let's see if I can "
C,Task,"I think still though comm it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"like 'cause if you just have like one menu button comm that works like with a "
C,Task,"you know comm or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well for sure we need the um "
D,Task,"I think we can just design the channels ? "
D,Task,"I mean power's just a button comm and it's not used that much comm "
A,Minor,"S "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
D,Task,"s and it's usually that red "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"You know comm I've seen some remotes that where you just hold one comm "
A,Task,"like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . "
A,Task,"So you don't actually have a separate power button comm it's just "
D,Task,"Oh okay comm yeah . "
C,Task,"It seems like that would be hard though . "
A,Minor,"But "
C,Minor,"I mean comm like because unless you know "
A,Task,"It might be confusing . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Just 'cause I wouldn't "
C,Task,"I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Besides you like to be able to go power . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I never think to hold something down . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"I have the power "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"B Yeah . "
A,Task,"I guess . "
A,Task,"So we definitely want a power button and numbers . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Right . "
D,Task,"Well even um iPod thing comm "
D,Minor,"like um comm "
D,Elicit,"I don't know if people like this "
D,Task,"but if you want to reduce the number comm of buttons comm instead of having like one to nine comm have a sort of "
C,Task,"That sort of like joystick flat touch thing comm yeah . "
D,Task,"scrolling "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Because people li seem "
D,Task,"now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no "
D,Task,"Know you don't have one two three four five "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"I think that's an interesting idea comm 'cause it's cool comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"it's it's funny like you f like I just "
C,Task,"I don't have an iPod but like I comm you know comm I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day comm "
C,Minor,"and you just sort of and "
C,Task,"it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily comm "
C,Task,"like it's not that hard comm you know . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah comm it's just and it's one thing which has everything . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm and it is yeah . "
C,Minor,"It is really "
C,Elicit,"but do you need a screen then comm do you have to have a screen then ? "
D,Minor,"Well can't it tell the like can't you if you "
B,Task,"Yeah comm you can have the number going around in the corner . "
D,Task,"you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button . "
A,Minor,"Oh that's gonna "
A,Elicit,"Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of "
C,Task,"Like a disc . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah . It's like it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad . "
A,Task,"okay . "
A,Task,"I've never used one . No . "
D,Task,"It's like l this like that comm and then you do that . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah and then . "
D,Minor,"And then you can have um "
D,Task,"if you actually just want to zap comm you can have like a thing like that comm and that comm and then it can just be plus and minus . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"So like it's like a little part of the circle that "
C,Minor,"Or it "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can "
D,Minor,"you can "
A,Minor,"Well i "
D,Task,"Yeah comm click o actually click on to have "
C,Task,"zap . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"We could we could even have four buttons comm "
A,Task,"like comm if that's the if that's the mouse comm you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So volume could be like the top it and the bottom "
C,Minor,"So do you need to "
B,Elicit,"Doesn't it rotate though comm "
C,Task,"okay . "
B,Task,"so it'll be moving around . "
C,Task,"Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like "
D,Elicit,"What do you mean the function ? "
C,Minor,"I mean like okay comm 'cause so "
C,Minor,"I dunno comm I guess Okay "
C,Task,"so when you g scroll your thumb like around it comm it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . "
C,Task,"That that means you're gonna go up the channels comm "
C,Task,"and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"But then "
C,Task,"so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where "
C,Task,"like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way comm that's that way and volume is up and down . "
D,Task,"Yeah but it knows for some reason . "
C,Minor,"It just "
D,Task,"The iPod knows . "
C,Task,"It just kno the iPod knows . S "
B,Task,"If it works on an iPod then it works . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
C,Elicit,"So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . "
B,Task,"I don't have one . "
D,Task,"Well for the volume you have to press the middle comm and then go up . "
C,Task,"Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . "
C,Elicit,"Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up comm go up and down . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
D,Task,"And then well if you do that it goes comm "
A,Minor,"So it's like holding "
D,Task,"but if you like that makes more sense "
D,Task,"'cause there's already ones with up and down here comm that I've seen . "
A,Minor,"You can o "
A,Minor,"And you "
A,Minor,"you "
A,Elicit,"is there an extra actual button ? "
A,Elicit,"Or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down . "
D,Minor,"Well what you "
A,Minor,"Like "
D,Minor,"for the iPod you press an "
C,Minor,"It's like a b "
D,Task,"w right if you're on the channel let's say comm then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up comm and if you do that it goes down . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here comm I'm pretty sure "
A,Elicit,"Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels comm right comm then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Like you could just have "
D,Task,"I don't know comm "
D,Task,"you could click and then have it up and down comm "
A,Minor,"Oh comm like "
C,Minor,"Like "
A,Minor,"Oh you could actually "
D,Minor,"but I think "
C,Task,"I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"But the only thing is like comm iPods are so expensive comm "
C,Minor,"like comm it has to be "
C,Elicit,"is that part of "
A,Elicit,"Is that what makes them expensi "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I think it's all of "
C,Task,"I dunno comm I dunno . "
A,Task,"they have so much memory though comm "
B,Task,"I don't think so . "
C,Elicit,"You don't think so ? "
A,Minor,"that's it's "
B,Task,"I don't think it's the wheel dealy . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"I think it "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,". "
C,Minor,"I'm thinking we could "
C,Minor,"if if we're hav So ba "
C,Task,"I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know . "
B,Elicit,"And they're re-programmable aren't they ? "
B,Task,"You can put on your songs and then put on a different set comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"that's probably why they're expensive comm they're like little computers . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"S "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Well like since it just has the circle thing comm you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape comm "
C,Task,"like it could be a cool sort of you know comm because it could be circular comm you know comm or something weird like that comm just "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . "
D,Task,"Because comm the other thing comm I didn't tell you all my presentation comm is that people find it find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and that's another thing they complained about . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm what other buttons were there ? "
D,Task,"Volume "
D,Task,"oh we've ts just said that . "
C,Minor,"So okay . "
D,Task,"Channel selection . "
C,Elicit,"This is just for T_V_ comm it's not for or it is does need to be compatible with "
B,Minor,"I "
A,Minor,"Um "
B,Task,"A D_V_D_ is simple comm you just have play comm pause comm eject comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"So how do you switch "
D,Task,"Menu . "
A,Task,"You know actually our our new project requirements comm I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things . "
B,Task,"and menu maybe . "
B,Minor,"Oh yeah . "
A,Other,"So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So like if we had that "
A,Task,"But we'll hold off on that 'cause "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"But s yeah uh . "
D,Task,"But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote . "
C,Task,"That's true comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So comm I know I'm not c really clear on what "
B,Task,"But it's cool to have it all on one comm "
B,Task,"because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume comm and then you wanna go to the menu comm so you don't wanna switch . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So you'd have to have like "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"I think you would have to have like a function switch button comm "
C,Task,"you know somewhere so like you can you're either on T_V_ comm you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ comm or you're like . So "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm it is only fun "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc comm the touch pad . "
A,Minor,"But i "
B,Task,"Oh . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"But I think the circle only does "
B,Task,"channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna "
C,Minor,"Yeah but it it would be "
B,Task,"but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch . "
C,Elicit,"So but I'm saying like comm does it make sense to have like some kind of a button comm "
C,Task,"so like you're if you're on T_V_ comm like you can switch channels comm "
C,Task,"but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks "
C,Minor,"or s you know comm to different "
C,Elicit,"I mean do we need to think about that comm "
C,Minor,"that like "
A,Task,"Um comm yeah comm let's think about it "
B,Task,"Yes we can try that . "
A,Task,"'cause we need to wrap up . "
A,Minor,"Um let's see . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire comm "
A,Task,"uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work comm "
A,Task,"um yeah comm so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . "
A,Other,"See you soon . "
