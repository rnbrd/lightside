A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"now we are on the conceptual design meeting . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Uh y getting close to the last "
A,Task,"is the penultim meeting . "
B,Other,"How was lunch ? "
A,Other,"Mm great . "
D,Other,"Thanks "
D,Other,"Don't be sarcastic . Mark . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"I will again do the secretary part "
A,Task,"uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design comm first Rama then Mark and then Sammy . "
D,Task,"Uh Rama . "
C,Task,"Ramaro . "
A,Task,"Um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts "
A,Task,"and we have forty minutes . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Minor,"what we want to "
A,Task,"the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept comm so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . "
A,Task,"And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . "
A,Task,"And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing . "
A,Minor,"It's "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"let's go . "
A,Task,"First with Rama . "
A,Elicit,"Participant two . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm participant two . "
C,Task,"Component . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy comm and the material and interface . "
C,Task,"For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . "
C,Task,"First one comm we can use simple battery comm "
C,Task,"or we can use traditional solar cells "
C,Minor,"or "
C,Task,"mm and the material we can have plastic comm "
C,Task,"rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ "
D,Other,"Ah . "
C,Task,"and then uh titanium comm which can be which have very good look "
C,Task,"an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . "
C,Task,"And we can use some comm moving kind of thing . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"as we discussed before comm "
C,Minor,"we need to "
C,Task,"we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"this can be simple kind of programmable chip "
C,Minor,"and "
C,Task,"which can use microphone sensors . "
C,Task,"And we also want to look at our remote control comm "
C,Minor,"so . "
C,Task,"Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range comm like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that . "
C,Task,"So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm comm okay . "
C,Minor,"So uh "
C,Minor,"we discussed an "
C,Other,"Excuse me . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells "
C,Task,"and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and so we would like to just use simple battery . "
C,Task,"And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or "
C,Minor,"and "
C,Minor,"well "
C,Task,"the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . "
D,Elicit,"What is a double-curved shape ? "
C,Task,"Like you can have two curves . "
D,Other,"Uh-huh . "
B,Elicit,"Why ? "
C,Task,"Uh it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"we want to go for simple push buttons "
C,Task,"because it need a simple chip "
C,Task,"and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ "
C,Minor,"which are "
C,Task,"uh which needs advanced chip technology "
C,Task,"and it's more expensive comm "
C,Task,"since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"we want to reduce uh cost . "
D,Task,"The cost . "
A,Elicit,"Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber comm if it is something that it seems to be light . "
C,Task,"Uh Uh And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"and "
A,Elicit,"You m titanium it's more uh "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium "
B,Task,"but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts "
B,Minor,"like "
D,Elicit,"Mm like this ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yes so mm "
B,Task,"to make it feel better "
B,Minor,"and to "
B,Minor,"you know "
C,Task,"Like in cell phones recently "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"these you can with the rubber in four directions and "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Task,"But full assembly We'll use mainly for titanium "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"rubber is expensive "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"And this push buttons "
A,Minor,"Uh yeah so "
C,Task,"we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s "
C,Minor,"and so we want to mo "
C,Task,"I mean we're we want to put speech recognition "
C,Task,"so we want to reduce price on this technology "
C,Task,"and so that we can have enough space or enough money "
A,Minor,"Okay comm s so "
A,Elicit,"simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated . "
C,Minor,"for "
C,Minor,"S S "
D,Minor,"Speech "
C,Task,"Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"and still we have "
B,Elicit,"mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? "
D,Task,"L_C_D_ . "
B,Other,"L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ . "
C,Minor,"Uh l "
D,Task,"Seems not comm "
D,Task,"it's either L_C_D_ or push-button . "
C,Minor,"So uh "
C,Minor,"it's like a "
B,Task,"No comm "
B,Task,"it's not gonna be a t no touchable "
B,Task,"but still like a source of information or source for menus . "
D,Other,"Ah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design "
C,Minor,"then if we have enough money or like for and "
B,Other,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"so let's try it comm "
C,Task,"because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something "
B,Minor,"let's t "
C,Task,"so we want to reduce the cost on display "
D,Minor,"The L_C_D_ would "
C,Minor,"or this inter "
D,Elicit,"The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
B,Task,"it's it's not gonna be a touch pad comm uh just a display for giving you information . "
D,Task,"Just uh for output comm "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Ok Yeah comm that can we we can consider comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"because like it won't take much money I guess comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"because "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm yep . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"You have any further questions "
C,Minor,"or ? "
D,Task,"I guess no "
D,Minor,"um . So "
D,Elicit,"the batteries uh are going to be very light . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"we're to go for li "
C,Task,"and now I think we have many options in the market "
C,Task,"so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"for really light batteries and with uh good price . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically comm "
D,Task,"instead of clapping why not just be ask . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"that's "
C,Task,"then the the one thing we want to know is like "
C,Task,"because remote control is used for like in the household "
C,Task,"so it it it will be it m maybe at least five comm six people want to use it "
C,Elicit,"so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . "
C,Task,"If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome "
C,Task,"and we need really m more technology "
C,Minor,"and so "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Elicit,"for the location . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something . "
A,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
A,Minor,"let's now go to the "
A,Elicit,"you don't have more question ? "
D,Task,"No comm it's okay . "
B,Task,"No more questions . "
A,Other,"Um mm thank you mm . "
C,Other,"Yep . "
C,Other,"Thank you . "
D,Task,"Puts less of constraint on what we can do "
D,Minor,"but "
B,Task,"Mm yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"it's always like that . "
D,Task,"We have dreams "
D,Task,"and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm but mm . "
C,Task,"Oh . We have uh some limitations . "
D,Task,"Anyway . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice comm "
D,Task,"L_C_D_ . "
D,Task,"L_S_D_ is something else comm "
B,Other,"L_C_ "
D,Task,"and it's quite nice as well . "
B,Task,"I'm an artist comm "
B,Other,"sorry . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
B,Minor,"So uh comm "
B,Minor,"that's not "
A,Minor,"Um yeah . "
D,Task,"go on uh artist . "
B,Other,"I hope that's not too much . "
A,Task,"Now let's talk about uh interface . "
B,Minor,"Okay . Uh "
B,Task,"participant number three . "
A,Other,"Three . "
C,Minor,"Three . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
A,Elicit,"Which one ? "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"mm mm uh have a look at this "
B,Minor,"no it's "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Uh so "
B,Other,"the concept of the interface . "
B,Task,"Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface comm but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . "
B,Task,"So let's start with this . "
B,Task,"We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons "
B,Task,"and uh we got explanation for every button "
B,Task,"and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons "
B,Task,"and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here "
B,Task,"and uh go back button comm I don't know really where it is comm maybe one of this buttons comm "
B,Task,"and um power on and off mm I I don't remember "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"so uh "
B,Minor,"it it it should be "
B,Task,"maybe this button is power on and off ? "
B,Task,"Or no ? "
B,Task,"I can see nothing . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"that's our concept . "
B,Task,"It's called the millennium remote control . "
D,Task,"Let's change millenniums . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"maybe you can use in the end and "
D,Task,"doesn't make sense . "
D,Task,"This is very ugly . "
B,Elicit,"Really ? "
B,Task,"I thought you like it . "
D,Task,"Oh no comm "
B,Minor,"Ah okay "
B,Task,"just press the button comm please uh . "
D,Task,"too much concept . "
D,Other,"Ah . "
A,Task,"No . "
C,Other,"Uh "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"we will not use this . We will not use this . "
B,Task,"But instead of this I will devise That's our concept . "
D,Minor,"Ah comm "
D,Task,"back today . "
B,Task,"And it's got just few buttons comm quite low looking comm and all this stuff we already we already discussed . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . 'Kay . "
B,Elicit,"And uh what will people say ? "
B,Task,"They'll say it's perfect . "
B,Elicit,"Or what will say ? "
B,Task,"Uh they will say it's splendid . "
B,Task,"And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And everyone's gonna be satisfied . "
D,Elicit,"Do you think it can come in several colours ? "
D,Minor,"Or did the "
B,Task,"I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours . "
D,Elicit,"Um but not the case . "
B,Task,"Not the case . "
D,Elicit,"Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff comm "
D,Minor,"like "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Because apparently from your survey people like colours comm "
A,Elicit,"no ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"well "
D,Minor,"they like uh something which is uh "
B,Minor,"Okay comm so "
B,Task,"let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels . "
D,Other,"Mm yeah comm okay comm "
D,Task,"so that would be the option "
B,Elicit,"Do you like it ? "
D,Task,". I don't know "
D,Task,"I don't have a Nokia phone comm "
D,Minor,"but "
C,Minor,"But it's uh "
D,Task,"I don't use that "
D,Task,"but again comm uh I might "
B,Task,"That's why you don't have it . That's why comm "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"bu but "
B,Task,"'cause it's nasty . "
C,Elicit,"But it would be expensive comm no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ . "
B,Task,"No . "
C,Task,"Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Maybe we can just "
C,Task,"if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly . "
B,Other,"Um comm I am here . "
C,Task,"So users have different I mean they have their own interests comm colour interests and so "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So ? "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"So we can just "
C,Task,"if they want they can just pay another two Euro . "
A,Other,"Uh-huh comm okay comm "
B,Minor,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Elicit,"you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_ comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah yes . "
C,Minor,"If they want like uh so that we can "
D,Task,"Kind of upgradable uh remote control . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"Wow comm wow . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Just they'll get few more things and few more colours . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Minor,"what uh "
B,Task,"there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact comm um "
B,Task,"'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are comm "
B,Task,"like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around comm like what colour is around comm and depending on the temperature comm "
C,Task,"Lights comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And thermodynamic also . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Like a chameleon . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"We can make it in fact . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"but that's maybe mo too much expensive comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"If if if the "
B,Other,"okay . "
D,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"But uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version comm "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . "
B,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful "
D,Other,"uh I'm going to talk about this later "
D,Minor,"but "
D,Task,"and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them "
D,Task,"so it it's like a signature . "
D,Task,"My remote control is pink . "
D,Task,"Nobody else than me has a pink remote control . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Other,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"And that makes me special . "
A,Minor,"Okay "
A,Elicit,"and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more "
A,Minor,"because of uh o or this is "
D,Task,"I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . "
A,Other,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"so "
D,Other,"Those who wanted to have it pink . "
A,Minor,"so "
A,Minor,"i "
C,Minor,"Uh "
A,Elicit,"it's not uh a s base service "
D,Task,"No mm no . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"it's a "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"be an option comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"It might be optional comm yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"But those people will be really few comm "
C,Elicit,"no ? "
C,Minor,"So like "
C,Minor,"we can those "
D,Task,"The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . "
C,Other,"Ah . "
D,Task,"Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So m so "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base . "
D,Minor,"Mm . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Task,"But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time . "
B,Task,"And it makes you different comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"And you'll be different . "
B,Elicit,"you know ? "
D,Task,"You always have your remote . "
A,Other,"Uh in the train uh comm hello uh no . Want to change my neighbour . "
D,Other,"Oh comm you don't ? Yeah . You don't have your remo "
B,Elicit,"Anyone has their remote controls here ? "
B,Elicit,"No ? "
D,Minor,"Wh "
D,Minor,"you you know like "
D,Task,"for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control . "
D,Task,"Uh it's white "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere . "
D,Task,"It has this distinctive look and feel and look "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"which people seems to like "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White . "
B,Other,"Uh-huh comm uh-huh . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Could we integrate something into our remote control comm something like light ? "
D,Other,"Seems important . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Task,"That they can use it in darkness comm like . Hand light comm "
D,Task,"Mm glow in the dark comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"so that like at least um "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
A,Other,"Iradium ? "
B,Minor,"Okay . Okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"Ah sorry . Mm . "
C,Minor,"that "
A,Minor,"Okay . So mm "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . S well comm "
B,Task,"let's go on maybe with the presentation . "
D,Task,"Yeah . Uh-huh comm yeah sure . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And um the remote control's going to be smart "
C,Task,"Oh . "
B,Elicit,"but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? "
B,Minor,"And uh "
B,Task,"I dunno "
B,Task,"that's a question to you "
B,Minor,"and to mm to "
D,Minor,"Well so "
D,Task,"I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done "
D,Task,"uh so that's the smartness of the thing . "
D,Task,"Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . "
B,Task,"Okay comm okay . "
D,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Other,"Mm comm that's a nice world . "
B,Task,"So just just just just think about it um . "
D,Other,"Don't touch the remote . "
B,Other,"Thank you . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"But yeah . "
D,Elicit,"Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"for instance the young guy would not be able to use it "
D,Task,"because his father doesn't want . "
B,Task,"Uh yeah "
D,Minor,"Like with some "
B,Task,"I just want to say it should be real smart . "
D,Task,"Maybe fingerprint recognition or "
B,Task,"Voice recognition is quite tough . "
B,Task,"I say don't use it comm and the control just looks . "
D,Task,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it . "
D,Minor,"Um "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Uh that mm that could be feasible I guess comm "
C,Minor,"like "
D,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use "
D,Task,"So it could be smart in that way . "
C,Task,"yeah . Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . "
D,Task,"S since it it knows who is using it comm "
D,Task,"it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm sure . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and provide you ways of using them comm I dunno comm somehow comm "
D,Task,"I dunno comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"that might be expensive "
D,Minor,"but "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Uh it's "
D,Task,"that might also be a good sales pitch again . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"The remote that knows you . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Other,"thanks . "
A,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"My turn ? "
A,Minor,"it's "
A,Task,"yeah comm Marketing Expert . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm "
D,Task,"it's alright . "
A,Elicit,"Participant two ? "
C,Task,"Four . "
A,Other,"Four comm "
D,Task,"Four comm I think . "
A,Other,"sorry . "
D,Task,"Trend comm "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Other,"No uh "
D,Task,"yes . "
D,Minor,"Okay comm so "
D,Other,"I'm going to talk about trends "
D,Other,"and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Task,"next slide please . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Other,"first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"it's not so uh simple "
D,Task,"you might think that it's easy "
D,Task,"but uh it's not so simple . "
D,Task,"Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know comm "
D,Task,"so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing comm "
D,Task,"and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control "
D,Task,"which basically is a small device that people have with them comm always comm like a phone . "
D,Task,"We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired . "
D,Task,"Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired "
D,Task,"because in fact they're not only watching the trends comm "
D,Task,"they're inventing it comm they're creating the trend . "
D,Other,"I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . "
D,Task,"This is more risky "
D,Task,"because you're not following the trend comm "
D,Task,"you try to invent it comm "
D,Task,"which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . "
D,Minor,"So anyway uh "
D,Task,"next slide please . "
D,Other,"Uh to be to be quick "
D,Task,"there's a lot of words here "
D,Task,"but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . "
D,Task,"The first one comm which seems to be the most important one comm is that it has to be fancy comm it has to have a fancy look and feel . "
D,Task,"And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . "
D,Task,"Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be comm it has to be technologically i innovative comm "
D,Task,"it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside "
D,Task,"and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing "
D,Task,"which we w may think that would have been the most important comm "
D,Task,"which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . "
D,Task,"So as you see uh it first have to be very nice comm "
D,Task,"s something that people are proud of "
D,Task,"uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with "
D,Task,"uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff "
D,Task,"that they can talk about with their friends comm huh comm mine has this and not yours . "
D,Task,"And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control "
D,Task,"but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . "
D,Task,"Next slide please . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . "
D,Task,"If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas "
D,Minor,"so "
D,Task,"currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan comm well comm it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel "
D,Minor,"or "
D,Minor,"so . "
D,Task,"And I think of course uh i it applies to everything . "
D,Task,"That's the thing with trends . "
D,Task,"It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea . "
D,Task,"Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . "
D,Task,"And uh if we co we compare to last year comm now it has to be spongy comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"What is spongy ? "
D,Task,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well "
D,Minor,"this so so I think uh uh i "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"kind of um maybe "
D,Task,"When we were talking about rubber comm "
D,Task,"I think uh the rubber aspect might be important "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Minor,"it "
D,Task,"because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"S "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"So maybe titanium it's not a good idea . "
D,Task,"Seems not comm seems not . "
C,Task,"We need to think about mm mm . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So "
A,Other,"Um sorry Mark . "
A,Minor,"It seems to be "
D,Task,"Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy comm "
C,Minor,"Fruit . "
C,Elicit,"Even shape ? "
D,Minor,"as a "
D,Task,"even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean "
C,Minor,"More "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Minor,"that's what people seem to "
A,Other,"Hmm . You're old-fashioned . "
D,Task,"yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought "
A,Other,"Sorry . "
D,Task,"but that's that's fashion "
D,Minor,"and "
B,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Okay "
D,Task,"that's all I have to say . "
A,Elicit,"Mm you have questions ? "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? "
C,Minor,"Or it's "
D,Other,"These I'm sorry . "
C,Minor,"This you you so did you "
D,Other,"Yeah comm yeah "
D,Task,"we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world comm of course comm "
C,Elicit,"Where ? "
C,Other,"Oh . Oh comm "
C,Minor,"okay comm mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"as you know our company is quite big "
D,Task,"and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends "
C,Minor,"It's not from "
C,Minor,"mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"that are also "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Elicit,"It's more general trend "
D,Minor,"well . "
C,Elicit,"it's not particular to the remote control . "
D,Task,"No comm it's not it's not "
D,Task,"this this is very general comm yeah . "
D,Task,"But it seems that trends travel across things . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"The what we "
C,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid "
C,Task,"like they can't be really spongy "
D,Task,"Sure . "
C,Minor,"or "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables "
C,Minor,"yeah yeah . "
C,Task,"yeah comm yeah "
C,Task,"sponge comm "
C,Minor,"yeah yeah "
C,Minor,"at least that's "
D,Task,"but we still have to put our chips inside comm so of course . "
C,Task,"Yeah yeah "
D,Task,"This is your problem . "
C,Minor,"that "
C,Task,"yeah yeah . "
D,Task,"This is not mine . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"looking "
C,Minor,"yeah "
C,Task,"fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . "
C,Task,"We can have t colours or this shape "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . "
C,Minor,"or at least "
D,Task,"If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"Okay ? "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"No more question ? "
A,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Yep . Thanks . "
A,Other,"So Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Task,"we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . "
A,Task,"Um now you have to go straight on this individual action "
A,Task,"which i which are for Rama uh wil design comm "
C,Minor,"Look and feel de "
A,Task,"um Mark the user interface design comm "
A,Task,"and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . "
D,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
C,Task,"Mm sounds interesting . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm "
A,Task,"um and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . "
D,Other,"Okay . "
B,Other,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Elicit,"can we highlight the specific features of our "
A,Task,"Yeah you're right comm you have to "
C,Minor,"yeah comm so so "
C,Task,"we want the speech recogniser "
C,Task,"and we want some kind of buttons "
C,Task,"and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables comm "
C,Minor,"that's "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we want to follow general trend . "
A,Minor,"you say s "
D,Task,"Spongy . "
A,Minor,"S "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"do we agree on that ? "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"We have to . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Minor,"do you think "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"we have to "
B,Minor,"uh for "
D,Task,"No comm we don't have to comm "
A,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"but seems it's the trend . "
C,Task,"Hmm . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Again comm as I said we can also try to make it comm to create the trend . "
B,Other,"yeah "
B,Minor,"so "
D,Minor,"So there's no "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"are we confident enough on creating trends ? "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Minor,"that's "
D,Task,"you t can try to convince us . "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"we can make it smell like fruit . "
D,Task,"Okay . that's a good idea comm "
A,Task,"Okay comm that's a good idea . "
C,Minor,"That's "
A,Elicit,"So titanium smell like fruit . "
D,Minor,"I "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"what about location and these things comm people are really interesting on those features ? "
C,Elicit,"Or they really like They more want these fancy features "
D,Minor,"Uh "
D,Minor,"I think i "
D,Minor,"yeah "
C,Minor,"like "
D,Minor,"i it's again in this uh "
D,Task,"what I said first "
D,Task,"it has to be fancy "
D,Task,"so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Feature "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"because we have it "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"and others don't . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"It's fancy . "
D,Task,"Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I I agree with uh this uh "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . "
A,Elicit,"Do we take titanium smelling like fruit comm "
A,Elicit,"or do we make spongy uh fruity-like "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Uh "
C,Task,"we will try to explore these two options "
D,Task,"Maybe you could explore the two option . "
C,Minor,"and "
A,Task,"Mm . Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"yeah yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm comm mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean fruit-shaped . "
C,Task,"Uh yeah "
C,Task,"at least like we can make banana "
C,Minor,"or "
A,Elicit,"Don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape "
B,Minor,"But "
C,Task,"yeah "
B,Task,"Doub double-curved . "
D,Minor,"Mm . Seems to be . "
C,Minor,"it's it's "
C,Minor,"yeah "
A,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"that's a "
C,Task,"we're to look for "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . Okay . "
C,Task,"and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive "
B,Minor,"Okay comm okay . "
C,Minor,"and d "
B,Task,"In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body . "
C,Minor,"Hmm . "
B,Minor,"Well comm okay "
A,Minor,"Mm-mm . Okay comm so "
B,Task,"w we'll see . "
A,Task,"you explore now that you're going to work together these these two . "
B,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Or or spongy an "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or "
B,Task,"We'll see . We'll see . "
D,Task,"If you have time . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"I don't think w "
A,Task,"I think we have to choose . "
A,Task,"If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy "
C,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Task,"but uh it cannot be both . "
B,Task,"We'll see . "
B,Task,"I I really don't like this modelling clay "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"'cause you know it makes some for for "
B,Task,"I dunno uh "
D,Task,"For creation . "
B,Minor,"yeah um "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"we'll look . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Ah "
A,Task,"you can pretend that it's uh titanium . "
C,Minor,"Even design . "
D,Task,"You can paint it afterward . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm okay . "
D,Task,"No problem . "
D,Task,"We have a very large department of paint . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"do don't worry comm "
A,Minor,"you you you speak with mm mm . "
D,Task,"You will do it . "
B,Task,"Alright comm alright . "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
A,Task,"explore a shape . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or "
A,Task,"Mm I think it's what we say comm that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Not uh "
D,Task,"The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"then we can "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"yeah comm yeah comm "
C,Task,"that user friendly "
C,Minor,"or "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"That's the converse to having zillions of button "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"where each button does only one thing . "
A,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Elicit,"and we just stick with two batteries "
C,Elicit,"so it's not any solar or "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Classical comm we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel . "
C,Task,"yeah yeah j yeah comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"because "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Anyway it's very "
D,Task,"in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control . "
D,Minor,"So . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Because the trend goes faster than the life of the "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"So it's very "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Elicit,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"are we "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"We're done . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm we're done . "
A,Minor,"mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"So see you in thirty minutes . "
C,Task,"Yep . "
