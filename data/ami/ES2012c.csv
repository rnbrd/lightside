A,Elicit,"Alright ? "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . "
A,Task,"Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one "
A,Task,"um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . "
A,Other,"Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . "
A,Task,"Um the the the problem with existing remote controls comm we felt comm was that they're ugly "
A,Task,"um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . "
A,Task,"Um they've got lots of buttons on them "
A,Task,"that uh people don't use "
A,Task,"and find difficult to learn . "
A,Task,"Um and people lose them . "
A,Task,"And We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy comm "
A,Task,"um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons comm "
A,Task,"and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . "
A,Minor,"That "
A,Task,"um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery "
A,Task,"that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product "
A,Task,"and a shape that will be instantly recognisable comm A_ um as uh a trendy remote control comm and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . "
A,Task,"So that w uh when people are uh happy with that comm they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . Uh "
A,Minor,"Okay . So "
A,Task,"again um comm I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you "
A,Task,"and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . "
A,Task,"Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today comm finally comm are um what energy source we want to use comm "
A,Elicit,"whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one . "
A,Task,"And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply comm then basically it's uh sealed for life "
A,Task,"and uh if anybody does manage to run one down comm we'll we'll give them another one . "
A,Task,"And uh it it'll be uh comm you know comm prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature "
A,Task,"that it's um um comm you know comm for life comm guaranteed for life . "
A,Task,"Um now the the the internal chip "
A,Task,"um and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice "
A,Task,"and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible "
A,Elicit,"um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? "
A,Elicit,"Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? "
A,Minor,"Uh I mean "
A,Task,"I'm I'm I'm "
A,Task,"n not an expert on these things comm "
A,Task,"but presumably comm there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . "
A,Task,"But uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise . "
A,Task,"And then the uh comm you know comm the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendra's field "
A,Task,"and uh "
A,Task,"we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward "
A,Task,"and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today . "
A,Task,"Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface comm "
A,Elicit,"whether we p um go for voice comm buttons comm or or a bit of both . "
A,Task,"Uh and then uh comm you know comm f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look comm feel and design comm "
A,Task,"Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it "
A,Task,"and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . "
A,Task,"And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . "
A,Minor,"Uh so comm "
A,Task,"if if we can have the the three presentations again please comm "
A,Task,"and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k . "
B,Task,"Okay . Um "
A,Task,"Kate . "
A,Other,"Oh I'm sorry comm oh sorry . "
B,Other,"Um p there we go . "
B,Minor,"'Kay comm "
B,Other,"I'll just be talking about the components design . "
B,Minor,"And "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . "
B,Task,"Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command "
B,Task,"and then this is translated uh into uh light signals "
B,Task,"which are then seen by the T_V_ . "
B,Task,"Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery "
B,Task,"and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator comm uh two more resistors and a capacitor "
B,Task,"and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um . "
B,Task,"Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command "
B,Task,"and this creates a a connection within the the remote "
B,Minor,"that allows the chip "
B,Task,"the chip then senses this connection "
B,Task,"and produces a signal in a Morse code format . "
B,Task,"This signal's sent to the transistor "
B,Task,"which amplifies it "
B,Task,"and then sends it on to the light emitting diode "
B,Minor,"and uh "
B,Task,"which is then trai changed into a infrared light "
B,Task,"which is sent to the T_V_ "
B,Task,"and sort of seen by the T_V_ "
B,Task,"and which uh changes the channels . "
B,Minor,"Um . Oh . Uh "
B,Other,"cool . "
B,Minor,"Uh so "
B,Task,"as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . "
B,Task,"Uh y the fewer buttons you have comm I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . Um "
B,Task,"however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult "
B,Task,"and uh raise the production cost . "
B,Task,"That's something we should think about . "
B,Task,"Also we have to work within the company constraints comm "
B,Task,"and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons "
B,Task,"and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . "
B,Task,"Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use comm "
B,Task,"so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery "
B,Task,"and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years "
B,Task,"and we could still keep that original idea . "
B,Task,"Um we also need to look at the chips comm uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf comm "
B,Task,"and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility "
B,Task,"and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . "
B,Task,"Um comm however that's gonna cost more comm "
B,Task,"but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper "
B,Task,"and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster comm "
B,Task,"but it's going to be less flexible with the features comm especially things like uh voice activation comm "
B,Task,"which haven't really been used much on remotes comm "
B,Task,"so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert comm "
B,Task,"so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . "
B,Task,"And that pretty much sums it up . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Minor,"so how um "
A,Other,"sorry comm "
B,Task,"Mm . Oh yep comm "
A,Task,"can you uh just put that one back up again comm please ? Um . "
B,Other,"sorry . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Minor,"Uh d d d "
A,Minor,"okay comm I mean uh "
A,Task,"inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Um "
A,Elicit,"Do we do we know uh by how much ? "
B,Task,"I don't actually have any price information comm "
B,Task,"no . "
A,Elicit,"And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip . "
B,Minor,"Um "
B,Minor,"it "
B,Task,"a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . "
B,Minor,"Oh w yeah comm "
B,Minor,"we did the "
B,Task,"the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed comm "
A,Minor,"Right comm "
B,Task,"it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form comm "
A,Minor,"okay . "
B,Minor,"uh so it would uh "
B,Task,"it's hard to predict the time . "
A,Other,"Right comm "
A,Task,"I think we need to make a a decision here . "
A,Task,"Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . "
A,Elicit,"Um uh now before we go round everybody else comm does anybody um "
C,Minor,"I "
A,Elicit,"h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ? "
C,Other,"I just have a question about that . "
C,Elicit,"Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands comm "
C,Task,"for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten "
C,Task,"and pre-programme say comm you know comm nine channels "
C,Task,"and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one "
C,Task,"and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one comm as your favourite comm "
C,Task,"it's like to have a certain number of favourites um "
B,Minor,"W "
C,Minor,"and that w "
B,Task,"just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . "
B,Task,"Once you've got the whole voice chip in there comm then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit comm "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Then it doesn't matter . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"but to actually the "
B,Task,"the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Cause uh I must say I find it slightly surprising "
A,Task,"given that comm you know comm mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . "
A,Minor,"So uh um I mean "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I d d "
A,Task,"for slightly different "
A,Task,"well no comm "
A,Minor,"I mean comm "
A,Minor,"it's "
A,Task,"if you you "
A,Task,"speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you comm "
A,Minor,"so uh bu I mean "
A,Minor,"the this "
A,Minor,"this information is from is "
A,Elicit,"this is the internal company information comm is it ? "
B,Task,"Uh bits of it comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"So uh "
C,Task,"Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive comm "
B,Task,"Yes comm as well . "
C,Minor,"you know comm "
C,Task,"hundred and fifty pounds or something . "
C,Task,"As opposed to the twenty Euros comm twenty five Euros . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm mm true comm "
A,Task,"again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh "
A,Task,"uh decide . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them comm not just that comm so . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's that's right . "
A,Minor,"It's like it's it's you can't "
A,Task,"'cause mobile phones are expensive comm "
A,Task,"you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"But we don't know . Um . "
A,Minor,"I mean uh "
A,Minor,"I su i "
A,Minor,"I mean "
A,Minor,"if "
A,Task,"given that the um the technology is not well developed "
A,Task,"and and given that it's it's never been done before comm "
A,Task,"um th th the double risk comm "
A,Task,"uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons comm "
A,Task,"since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Um . "
A,Elicit,"Thoughts ? "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Minor,"another thought I "
D,Minor,"Would "
C,Other,"oh comm "
C,Other,"sorry comm "
C,Task,"go ahead . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Minor,"I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um "
D,Task,"maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . "
A,Elicit,"I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ? "
B,Minor,"Uh it's fundament "
B,Minor,"well I mean "
B,Task,"I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning comm "
B,Task,"so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental comm "
B,Task,"but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that comm "
B,Minor,"so I think you have to "
A,Minor,"I mean I think we "
C,Other,"Oh yeah . "
A,Other,"Mm . "
B,Other,"Hm . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Well comm "
C,Task,"I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it comm then maybe we should have it for the whole thing . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I I I I I think that's uh "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"And we've been talking about it the whole time . "
B,Minor,"Mm comm mm . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Anyway comm I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . "
A,Other,"Mm comm right comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah comm "
D,Task,"it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"From uh my presentation show comm so . "
A,Other,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"it should be "
D,Task,"Uh technologically innovative . "
A,Other,"Right comm okay comm "
A,Minor,"so . "
B,Minor,"No comm "
B,Task,"that sounds good . Mm . "
A,Task,"Fine . Okay . "
A,Minor,"I "
A,Task,"it will have voice recognition um uh "
B,Task,"Mm . Cool . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b "
A,Task,"second question comm "
A,Elicit,"do we need the five buttons for channel change comm up down comm volume up down and on off comm just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons ? "
B,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I I would say we do comm yeah . "
C,Task,"I think so . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Sorry comm "
A,Elicit,"d did you want to say anything ? "
B,Task,"Uh nope comm "
A,Other,"No ? "
B,Task,"that was it comm that was it . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Shall we move rapidly on to uh Kendra ? "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Uh um ra rapidly move the cable over . "
C,Other,"Let's see . "
A,Other,"Mm . Oh good . "
C,Other,"Oh . Yes . "
C,Elicit,"Is it gonna work ? "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Mm yeah comm "
B,Other,"it's thinking about it . "
A,Task,"it'll get there . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
C,Minor,"Okay . Okay comm "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"so I did some research on the internet "
C,Minor,"and um "
C,Minor,"what "
C,Minor,"you know comm "
C,Task,"the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users comm "
C,Task,"um commands and mechanisms for the operation comm "
C,Task,"and there're just kind of a variety of choices . "
C,Task,"Um findings comm "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"a lot of times they tend to look cluttered "
C,Task,"and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"There're some special ones available comm like this one right here comm "
A,Minor,"Mm comm yeah . "
C,Task,"which is marketed towards children comm um different designs comm "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
A,Minor,"Alright . "
C,Task,"and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume "
C,Minor,"because people some "
C,Task,"Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"just kind of minimise the clutter comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"avoid too many buttons "
C,Task,"and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button comm like you have on a mouse comm "
C,Task,"that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume comm for example comm have the slide button on the side comm "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and then you can pre-programme the channels comm the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator . "
A,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
A,Other,"Sorry "
A,Minor,"y y yeah comm "
A,Other,"if I can interrupt you . "
A,Minor,"Well "
A,Minor,"d p "
A,Minor,"'kay comm "
A,Elicit,"do you wanna say anything about um slide controls ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple comm cheap and reliable . "
B,Minor,"Uh Uh "
B,Task,"I think they're they're about the same cost really . "
B,Minor,"I I mean comm "
B,Minor,"I think it's just sort of the the "
B,Task,"there's a lot of slide buttons out there . "
B,Task,"I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . Mm yeah . "
A,Other,"Okay comm fair enough comm fine . "
C,Minor,"Just because I n "
C,Task,"for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Good comm good . "
C,Minor,"and then the "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"this is my great little drawing . "
A,Other,"So three three there's three buttons on a slider . "
A,Task,"Three buttons comm channel up channel up down and "
C,Task,"Y yes comm yes . "
D,Minor,"Well comm "
D,Task,"if you g if you if you got a channel up down comm we can have a slider in that as well . "
D,Minor,"Because if it if you no "
D,Task,"if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks comm "
D,Elicit,"if you know what I mean comm "
D,Task,"up like one unit comm "
D,Elicit,"if you see what I mean . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Mm . "
D,Task,"So it kinda goes up one comm "
D,Task,"then y like you can keep rolling it up comm "
D,Task,"but it's like like like like a cog or something . "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"So you kinda take it up one at a time . "
A,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons comm like the buttons on one side for the channel comm and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand comm and you pick it up comm it's easy to n s know comm okay comm this is just the volume and this is the channel . "
D,Minor,"D "
A,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
A,Other,"This one on the one side and one "
D,Minor,"Uh you could you could as l as like a mouse you could "
A,Task,"yeah . Okay . "
B,Task,"Ye yeah comm "
B,Task,"'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume comm or vice versa comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"You'd know what you were fiddling with . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"like the shape of it almost like a mouse comm "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"That was "
A,Minor,"or yeah uh th th the I mean thi this is what the "
D,Minor,"with a "
A,Task,"we have to come up with is the the actual shape "
A,Task,"that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"so we we're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change "
C,Minor,"Um well "
C,Task,"I was thinking kind of just for the volume comm "
A,Task,"of one sort . "
A,Other,"Just for the volume comm uh . "
C,Elicit,"but what what do you guys think ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Dep I dunno if it "
C,Minor,"We could "
D,Task,"depending on the final shape of it comm "
D,Task,"'cause you could have like comm I dunno comm it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb comm "
D,Task,"and then you could control the buttons with your fingers . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Other,"Fingers comm "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"'cause if "
B,Minor,"yeah comm "
B,Task,"in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling comm "
A,Minor,"It "
A,Minor,"yeah comm I mean "
A,Task,"it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different comm "
C,Minor,"B "
B,Minor,"just the way it would "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm yeah comm yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two . "
D,Other,"Oh yeah comm "
D,Task,"yeah . "
A,Minor,"So okay . Right so uh "
C,Other,"I'm just gonna pass this along . "
A,Minor,"that's "
A,Other,"sorry "
A,Elicit,"is that that all you want to say at the mo "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"okay comm fine . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm right . "
D,Other,"Here we go . "
A,Minor,"Right . "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah comm "
D,Task,"this is my report on trend watching . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . "
D,Task,"And we got reports from Paris comm Milan on new fashions . "
D,Task,"And uh the most important aspect is the l the look "
D,Task,"it has to look fancy comm look and feel "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"uh instead of the current functional look and feel . "
D,Minor,"This is a st "
D,Minor,"well "
D,Task,"I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it . "
D,Minor,"So uh "
D,Task,"and the third being easy to use is probably a given comm "
D,Task,"we have to try and incorporate comm "
D,Minor,"so uh "
A,Minor,"Well I I mean "
A,Minor,"I th "
A,Task,"I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those . "
D,Task,"Uh exactly comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"I s that out of sequence ? "
D,Other,"Uh yeah comm "
D,Other,"sorry . "
D,Minor,"Uh yeah comm and uh "
D,Task,"from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes comm et cetera . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"Uh sorry comm "
D,Task,"clothes comm shoes and furniture "
A,Minor,"Uh-huh . "
D,Task,"and uh a spongy material to be used on the on the outside . "
A,Minor,"Mm "
A,Task,"I hadn't thought of that comm "
A,Task,"that's different comm certainly . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"But uh I was gonna say "
D,Minor,"um yeah comm "
D,Task,"fruit and vegetables comm uh important to this year um important to furniture comm "
A,Elicit,"What ? "
D,Other,"I'm just gonna say "
D,Minor,"uh "
D,Minor,"f like it's in if if fashion "
D,Task,"if we're going for the it looks fancy comm then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"But fashions do don't last very long . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things comm "
B,Task,"like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year "
D,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and uh whatever happens next year comm we can have the face plates comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it "
B,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"and then we can just whip that off and "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah "
C,Task,"like the kind you get on like hand weights . You know comm that kind of spongy "
B,Other,"Mm comm yeah comm "
B,Task,"that weird I dunno what that is comm "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Task,"but yeah . "
C,Minor,"yeah . "
D,Minor,"A kind of "
D,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Also means you can drop it without damaging it . "
D,Minor,"Oh "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Uh comm yeah comm it's good as well . Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"That's c cool . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
D,Minor,"Um you have we could if we could save "
D,Elicit,"depending on the cost of the product itself comm you know comm could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? "
D,Task,"With interchangeable covers comm could just buy a new one every year comm a new one when new fashions come out . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I I mean it its uh I that's an interesting idea comm "
A,Task,"it's like the old Swatch watch "
A,Task,"where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those comm "
A,Task,"'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion comm "
A,Task,"but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um that's "
C,Minor,"Wh "
A,Task,"yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity "
B,Task,"I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one comm "
B,Task,"because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . "
A,Minor,"W I mean we we can uh uh b but "
A,Task,"I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last comm you know comm a long time . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Elicit,"What if we included the batteries in the cover ? "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Oh yeah . I like that . "
C,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers "
C,Minor,"like "
B,Minor,"and "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm so "
C,Task,"can I see that thing ? "
B,Task,"Um . "
A,Minor,"S "
C,Task,"Just this as examples . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I n I know the only p "
C,Minor,"So f "
A,Task,"I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection "
A,Task,"and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability comm "
A,Task,"whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all comm you know comm completely soldered together "
B,Task,"Uh yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I guess that's "
B,Task,"Mm . "
A,Task,"and it it it you know comm total reliability comm "
C,Task,"true . "
A,Minor,"but I mean I d I I uh "
A,Other,"I know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from . "
D,Minor,"Or well comm "
D,Minor,"but like uh like more than just the battery comm like a complete different like you've only got "
D,Minor,"like comm you know like th uh "
D,Task,"this bit's the bit you keep comm "
D,Task,"and this is the expensive bit comm "
D,Task,"this is like the chip "
D,Task,"and this is the microphone . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Task,"And then this is the power source "
D,Task,"and the bit everyone sees . "
D,Minor,"And then "
A,Minor,"I th I s "
A,Task,"I think if we're gonna go down that route comm then we're talking about uh even if it costs slightly more than that comm um just building the whole thing in one comm "
A,Task,"then having getting cheaper production costs "
D,Task,"Yeah comm you probably are right . "
A,Task,"um and comm you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing comm "
A,Task,"the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all comm it will still work um totally . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's true . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Um then if comm you know comm if people lose the cover comm I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"that that's just it with the covers comm you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I mean it is it's up to it's up to "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"just another five Euro to get "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Right . "
B,Task,"Mm comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Um and comm you know comm as as external fashions change comm then we get new new covers on the market and comm you know comm readily available . "
B,Task,"Mm . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"And um "
B,Task,"And that's the sort of thing comm once you get the mould set comm you can just whip out different colours comm different pictures very very quickly . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"like they have for mobile phones "
A,Task,"that's that's right comm yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah comm exactly comm exactly . "
C,Task,"that are just fruits and animal prints and colours . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Minor,"So uh i so uh okay . Um right comm "
A,Other,"sorry . "
A,Task,"Um we hadn't finished your "
D,Other,"Um oh comm don't worry "
D,Task,"it's all said comm "
D,Other,"I was just gonna say "
D,Minor,"uh yeah comm "
D,Minor,"are we gonna make this as part of like like uh a part of the f like it it "
D,Task,"the fashions apply to furniture comm "
D,Elicit,"so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ? "
A,Task,"It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um this is fashionable . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"This is fashionable "
D,Minor,"with "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I comm you know comm I'm I'm I'm with it comm I'm up to date . "
A,Task,"And you know comm th the the design that I've got comm and and it could be a a home-made design comm um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control comm "
A,Task,"this is comm you know comm a fashion accessory . Um comm "
A,Minor,"so I mean "
A,Minor,"the the the basic shape i is is what we uh "
A,Task,"I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably comm two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing . "
A,Elicit,"And comm know whether we go down the fruit and veg route comm "
A,Task,"and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana comm "
A,Task,"but um know sort of the the organic comm you know comm curved look comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
D,Other,"Oh yeah . "
A,Task,"t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know comm the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes "
A,Elicit,"and comm you know comm whether whether the you know comm the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . Um "
A,Minor,"mm or uh "
A,Task,"'cause there's certainly you know comm the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed "
A,Task,"so that people s th looked at it and say right comm that's a Real Reaction remote control comm I want one of those . "
B,Task,"I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow "
B,Task,"I kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it comm "
A,Task,"Yeah "
A,Minor,"uh the the uh or or b "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"like an . "
B,Minor,"but I'd "
B,Task,"yellow seems a bit of a strong colour "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"to make the ent like the thing "
A,Minor,"I'd I'd um "
B,Minor,"no comm "
A,Minor,"yeah . Uh no "
B,Task,"but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I d I I agree comm "
A,Task,"I mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"And make that a fashion symbol as well . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"n "
A,Minor,"Well comm "
A,Task,"th this is this is the whole point comm "
A,Task,"yes comm "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Minor,"I'm "
A,Other,"I've got a a Real Reaction uh remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever . "
A,Task,"And uh then people comm you know comm people demand more Real Reaction stuff . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse . "
B,Minor,"Mm . Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"So that comm you know comm when they hold it it's "
C,Task,"because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand "
C,Task,"um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape "
C,Task,"so they could hold on to it comm "
C,Task,"but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and "
A,Minor,"Yeah . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"have the power comm wherever comm somewhere . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"I mean that was just an idea that I had . "
A,Minor,"I mean I've uh yeah . "
A,Minor,"Oh no "
A,Minor,"that "
A,Minor,"well "
A,Minor,"there's the sim my "
A,Task,"my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape "
C,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm maybe . "
A,Task,"so that you can just sort of ho hold it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"you'd want it narrower than a mouse though "
C,Minor,"Kind of a c "
B,Task,"'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it comm "
B,Task,"you want something you can definitely grip . "
A,Minor,"W it "
B,Minor,"So maybe it'd be "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I mean well "
A,Task,"it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse comm "
C,Task,"Sort of a combination . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"but held comm you know comm "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that comm i with comm you know comm and fiddling with the buttons . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"and fiddle around with it "
B,Task,"and press it . "
C,Minor,"Yeah so yeah comm "
C,Task,"kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this comm "
C,Task,"'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold comm "
C,Minor,"and then if you had "
B,Task,"Maybe almost like a hairbrush comm like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"and then it widens up top "
C,Task,"then wider up here . "
B,Task,"and you can fiddle "
B,Minor,"an "
C,Task,"And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light comm the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume "
B,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Task,"and the power could be wherever comm up up the top or something . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm cool . "
C,Elicit,"What do you guys think about that ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"that sounds "
A,Task,"Okay comm yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Um I'm just I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels "
D,Minor,"t "
D,Task,"we still can just tell it to . "
D,Elicit,"I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ? "
C,Other,"Oh yeah . "
B,Other,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's a very good point . "
C,Task,"It is a very good point . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"That um the we n "
A,Task,"we need the the manual controls "
A,Task,"and that they should be of that form comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"but that uh yeah . "
B,Task,"But do you know comm this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice "
B,Task,"'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling comm "
B,Task,"but you can also bring it up like that "
A,Task,"Then you just bring it up to your mouth "
B,Task,"and it's microphone-esque comm "
A,Task,"and just speak to it comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"and just say "
A,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
D,Minor,"maybe we cou "
D,Minor,"like "
D,Minor,"w "
D,Minor,"like "
D,Task,"we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff comm "
D,Task,"but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"I th I th honest uh "
A,Task,"my personal view is that if it's not there comm people wouldn't use it anyway um . "
D,Task,"Mm I suppose comm "
D,Task,"but t there is the off chance that comm you know comm th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ "
D,Task,"or the contrast needs changing . "
A,Task,"It's cer it's certainly possible I mean comm "
A,Minor,"but they we we're going beyond w w "
B,Minor,"Bu "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work um . "
D,Task,"Hmm yeah . "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . "
B,Minor,"I mean uh "
B,Task,"if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands comm "
B,Task,"and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness "
A,Minor,"Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
D,Task,"that's a good idea . "
B,Minor,"and and sc "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"I suppose I sup "
B,Task,"and then you can you can minimise the buttons "
B,Task,"and still have those comm you know comm brightness and tint and stuff . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"If we we're "
A,Minor,"I mean "
A,Other,"I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . "
C,Task,"So I guess we could have a menu button as well . "
B,Minor,"Yeah "
C,Task,"We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume . "
A,Minor,"Uh uh uh "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"if we if we're going down that route comm then we need some sort of display . "
A,Elicit,"Do we need some sort of display ? "
B,Task,"But the television would be the display "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's on the T_V_ comm yeah . "
A,Other,"We actually use the television comm okay . Okay comm okay comm okay . "
B,Minor,"that "
B,Task,"things like that usually c pop up on a televi "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"and then y "
B,Task,"like you hit menu "
B,Task,"and menu will come up on television "
B,Task,"and have like tint brightness comm "
B,Task,"and you'd use the scroll comm scroll through it yeah . "
D,Minor,"Well I mean "
D,Minor,"on a "
A,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"onto like a mouse comm the ru the scrolling button comm is actually a button as well comm "
D,Task,"you could press it comm you could press that and have it as a menu button . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Yeah comm press that "
B,Task,"yeah comm that's true . "
C,Minor,"is t "
C,Task,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"that might work . "
B,Elicit,"I never understood how that worked though comm "
B,Task,"but yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"it's like um "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . You just press it . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"and you could just click that to "
C,Task,"so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . "
B,Other,"Mm comm oka yeah . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh yeah . "
C,Elicit,"You know what I mean ? "
A,Other,"Mm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"we got five minutes to go in this meeting comm "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"so um "
A,Minor,"I d "
A,Task,"I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um . "
B,Task,"Cool . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Minor,"b b "
A,Task,"Kate and Kendra now go away "
A,Task,"and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough comm "
B,Task,"Play with play-dough . "
A,Task,"whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic . "
D,Other,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete comm "
A,Other,"but that's a slightly inappropriate word "
A,Task,"um to something that we can we can see "
A,Task,"and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control . "
D,Other,"Uh can I just get some things clear just for my sake . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm certainly comm of course . "
D,Elicit,"Our energy source is gonna be "
A,Minor,"I think I think we decided that we're gonna for "
D,Elicit,"long term . "
A,Task,"for simplicity of comm you know comm manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um comm "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Other,"Cool . Uh "
A,Minor,"I "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Minor,"on the basis that um that comm "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Task,"if we're going for making it a fashion statement comm then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out "
A,Task,"and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years um . "
D,Elicit,"And we're having a custom chip ? "
A,Task,"We're having a a custom chip comm "
A,Task,"but given the the we've cut the functions down comm "
A,Task,"um that will hopefully not be too problematic comm "
A,Task,"but given that um technol technological innovation is important comm "
A,Task,"then we need to comm "
A,Other,"I'll say it again comm technologically innovate . "
A,Minor,"Um and uh "
A,Task,"we we comm know comm we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um . "
D,Elicit,"And interchangeable case ? "
A,Task,"I i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Um it it should be cheap comm you know comm if if we avoid any comm you know comm electrical connections . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"And uh i you know comm "
A,Task,"i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want comm then uh I mean uh uh this is totally new . "
D,Minor,"Mm comm mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"We d we don't know whether "
A,Task,"that to what extent people do it or not comm "
A,Task,"but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway comm "
A,Task,"and uh and if if we can keep them comm you know comm rolling comm "
A,Minor,"then uh "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Task,"so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets comm "
A,Other,"I won't mention any mention any names comm "
A,Task,"um it's uh it's good for the supermarket "
A,Task,"and it's good for us "
A,Task,"and it hopefully makes them feel better . "
D,Elicit,"And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or "
A,Minor,"Um the that I mean that's "
A,Task,"no comm "
A,Task,"because we've got so few buttons "
A,Task,"that it that actually makes that redundant . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm I think so too . "
B,Task,"Mm comm does actually comm yeah comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Cool . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"and especially for making them so like different and "
B,Task,"Mm different to feel comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
B,Task,"yeah comm yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"And the "
A,Minor,"you know comm "
A,Task,"that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life comm "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . Yep comm yeah . "
A,Task,"'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life comm "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"so no comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"I mean given the nature of the buttons we're having comm it's actually uh uh unnecessary I think . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"Are we having it that it's any angle comm or is it just "
A,Task,"As uh as wide "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"As wide as possible . "
A,Task,"cer certainly wider angle than than current comm "
A,Task,"so that if you're holding it comm you know comm anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know comm i i it will work most of the time um . "
C,Task,"Like this or like this . "
B,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
A,Other,"Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work . "
A,Minor,"Um yeah comm I mean "
A,Minor,"I d I th "
A,Task,"I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing comm then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"kinda like this whole "
B,Task,"Yeah comm mm . "
C,Task,"So you could use like this and it would go . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"'cause I mean the r reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it comm the chances are comm "
A,Task,"so if if they're holding it anyway comm the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"then uh then that that's the sort of coverage that we want . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um okay comm "
A,Minor,"d "
A,Elicit,"we're all clear where we go from here . "
B,Other,"Yep comm "
C,Other,"Yep . "
B,Task,"sounds good . "
D,Other,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm so "
A,Other,"thank you very much indeed "
B,Task,"'Kay . "
A,Task,"and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"'Kay . "
