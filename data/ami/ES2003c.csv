B,Task,"Alright comm yeah . "
B,Task,"crack on . "
B,Minor,"Okay so "
B,Task,"we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes . "
B,Other,"I think to sum up the last meeting comm would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out . "
B,Task,"Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick comm L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . "
B,Task,"Um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck comm "
B,Task,"the idea to try and separate us "
B,Task,"and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . "
B,Task,"Um that pretty much sums up the last one . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"we'll just crack on comm "
B,Task,"um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible . "
D,Task,"Uh uh okay . "
B,Minor,"Um uh the con today is the concep today . "
D,Minor,"I'll just "
B,Task,"This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase "
B,Minor,"and is um "
B,Other,"Sorry about this . . "
B,Elicit,"And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of comm um comm "
B,Elicit,"can we uh outsource these from elsewhere comm "
B,Elicit,"um will we have to construct any items ourselves ? "
D,Task,"Uh I have a presentation "
D,Task,"I just saved it in the uh the folder . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm okay "
B,Minor,"well "
B,Other,"I'll just uh I'll load it up then . Um . "
B,Minor,"Which one do y "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Elicit,"interface concept ? "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's me . "
B,Other,"That's you . "
B,Task,"We've got trend watching comm "
B,Task,"that's you . "
D,Minor,"It's uh "
D,Task,"Components design . "
B,Other,"Components design . "
D,Minor,". "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
D,Minor,"So Uh . "
D,Task,"The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all comm could be plastic our plastic . "
D,Task,"Uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well comm or titanium or even wood . "
D,Minor,"So uh "
D,Task,"we decide what it's gonna be . "
D,Task,"Probably plastic . Uh "
D,Task,"we need the infra-red transmitter . "
D,Task,"Get that off the shelf . "
D,Task,"Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it comm um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . Um "
D,Task,"if you go on to the next slide . Uh "
D,Task,"If you go on to f uh findings comm "
D,Task,"it's like two or three slides down . "
D,Minor,"Right . So comm "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"this is what I found we can use . Uh "
D,Task,"three different types of batteries . Um can either use a hand dynamo comm or the kinetic type ones comm you know that they use in watches comm or else uh a solar powered one . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Um . "
B,Minor,"Now comm "
B,Elicit,"the kinetic one comm we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it . "
C,Minor,"Cost is "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power comm would be my one query . "
B,Elicit,"Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"There's also a watch moves around a great deal more . "
B,Elicit,"Do you think ? "
D,Minor,"Uh . "
B,Minor,"W "
D,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I don't think it would . Um . "
D,Task,"And solar cells comm I dunno about that . "
C,Other,"yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh . We should probably just use conventional batteries . Um comm just like in usual remote controls . "
B,Elicit,"Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again comm you'd say ? "
D,Task,"Um . Yeah . "
D,Task,"Um . And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have . "
D,Task,"Uh one is a flat one comm "
D,Task,"and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . "
D,Task,"Um the materials are tha there as you can see comm "
D,Task,"but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved comm "
D,Minor,"uh which would be "
C,Elicit,"Titanium comm the really strong metal comm titanium ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Elicit,"Is it not also it's expensive ? "
D,Task,"and light . "
D,Task,"Uh comm i think so as well comm yeah . "
D,Task,"They make mountain bikes out of that comm "
B,Minor,"Um . Um . "
D,Elicit,"don't they . "
D,Task,"So it's really light as well . "
B,Task,"Curious . "
B,Task,"Um comm I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not comm "
B,Elicit,"the single curved and double curved comm would you be able to give an example ? "
D,Task,"Um . T yeah . "
B,Elicit,"Um could you maybe draw something ? "
B,Minor,"I you don't "
B,Task,"doesn't have to be perfect comm "
B,Task,"it's just 'cause I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two . "
D,Minor,"Uh . Well "
D,Task,"for a curved comm well I was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand . "
D,Task,"Uh maybe like this comm with the uh joy pad here . Joystick here . And maybe um an okay button around here comm "
D,Task,"so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily . "
D,Minor,"Um I don't exactly "
D,Task,"Double curved . It probably means this is probably double curved . "
D,Task,"Uh whereas a single curved would be like that . "
D,Task,"I guess . Or not necessarily . "
B,Elicit,"So it might literally just be "
C,Task,"Two curves . "
B,Other,"okay . "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Task,"like that . "
D,Task,"Whereas this is two curves . Um "
D,Task,"so I guess that's what they mean by uh double curve . "
B,Other,"Alright . "
D,Minor,"Um which obviously "
D,Task,"it looks better than the single curve comm "
D,Task,"but uh you can't have it in titanium comm "
D,Task,"which is "
D,Task,"uh a nice material . Uh "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"and for the buttons comm um it can have the scroll wheel "
D,Task,"which they use in mouses for com P_C_s . "
D,Task,"Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use comm "
D,Task,"and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"you have to decide comm "
D,Task,"there's trade-offs there . Um "
D,Minor,"if you want the buttons to be "
D,Minor,"oh yeah comm "
D,Task,"if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber comm then you have these rubber buttons as well . "
D,Minor,"But you're gonna ha "
D,Task,"I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . "
D,Task,"You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . "
D,Task,"You wanna enter just the number of it comm if you know it . "
D,Minor,"So um "
D,Task,"I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway . "
D,Elicit,"Do you think ? "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Task,"that was definitely something we can talk about . "
B,Minor,"Um so "
B,Elicit,"you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Minor,"depends where "
D,Task,"gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display . "
B,Elicit,"Um comm do you have any idea so far comm "
B,Task,"like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ comm "
B,Elicit,"does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? Or ? "
C,Elicit,"Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ . "
C,Minor,"Is that did I "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"I think compared to say just pressing buttons . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Elicit,"Advanced comm like three eight six advance . "
B,Task,"if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red comm "
B,Task,"whereas I think if we're controlling the L_C_D_ we definitely require a much more powerful chip . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think is the the point being made . "
C,Other,"Okay comm sure . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Other,"If I've not over-stepped . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah "
D,Minor,"i "
B,Minor,"Okay comm um "
B,Elicit,"should I go on comm "
B,Elicit,"or go back ? "
D,Minor,"Um "
C,Task,"Mm comm if we only have twelve Pounds fifty comm "
C,Task,"twelve Euros comm not even twelve Pounds . "
C,Elicit,"Twelve Euros comm what's that comm like eight pounds or something like that comm nine Pounds ? "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in producement and such . I assume . "
C,Other,"Okay comm "
C,Task,"that's good point . "
B,Task,"We have to look into the costs of those . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Other,"sorry . "
D,Task,"Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control . "
D,Task,"If you go to the one before that "
D,Minor,"uh so "
D,Task,"it just says what it does comm "
D,Task,"translate the key press into an infra-red signal "
D,Task,"and this is received by the T_V_ . "
D,Task,"Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press "
D,Task,"and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons comm the rubber buttons comm uh to uh get sent to the chip . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Task,"that's just how the control works inside . "
D,Task,"Um we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Minor,". "
B,Minor,"Um . "
B,Minor,". "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Elicit,"in the information that you've been supplied comm how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ? "
D,Task,"Um I think we can do it if uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . "
D,Task,"Um and then maybe use single curved uh case . "
D,Task,"Because we might need it to be curved for the uh thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . "
D,Task,"Um and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_ . "
B,Task,"Um I mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me . "
B,Task,"Um conventional battery would seem to make sense . "
B,Task,"Um I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"and I'm "
B,Elicit,"I don't know about anybody else comm "
B,Task,"but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ? . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"I also have a preference for rubber . "
B,Other,"Okay comm "
B,Minor,"well um "
C,Task,"Based on my research . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm well "
B,Task,"will we move on to user interface comm "
B,Minor,"and "
B,Elicit,"yeah ? "
A,Minor,". "
B,Other,"Um sorry comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"as long as were you ? "
D,Task,"Yep I'm finished . "
B,Other,"Yeah . Okay . "
B,Task,"Um and d d d interface concept . "
A,Task,"Yep . "
A,Other,"Now I'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Other,"and the white board "
A,Task,"'cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things this time . "
A,Task,"Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs comm "
A,Task,"and pretty much decided to just dump them all . "
A,Task,"I wasn't very impressed by them "
A,Minor,"and they didn't seem to re "
A,Task,"uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . "
A,Minor,"Um so "
A,Minor,"what I ra "
A,Task,"rather than looking at other remotes comm uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . "
A,Task,"Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on comm "
A,Task,"um so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . "
A,Minor,"Um so uh "
A,Task,"next slide comm if you please . "
A,Task,"Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick comm two function buttons and the L_C_D_ comm "
A,Task,"just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . "
A,Task,"I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad "
A,Minor,"because if you m "
A,Task,"because one of the menus that we could have available um v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels comm "
A,Minor,"so if there's something f "
A,Task,"and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um "
C,Minor,"digital . "
D,Other,"Ah comm okay . "
A,Task,"f f f for di for digital or um or for or for cable comm whatever comm "
A,Task,"you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels comm and then um your V_C_ uh and then the channel through your V_C_R_ and or D_V_D_ player . And or um box . "
A,Minor,"So it's not "
A,Task,"I'm not really excessively concerned about that . "
A,Task,"You must have two two modes comm "
A,Task,"basic mode comm where um the joystick's uh left right left right for channels comm up down for volume comm "
A,Task,"um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions . "
A,Task,"Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design comm um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . "
A,Minor,"Um comm so you "
B,Elicit,"Can I just jump in slightly there ? "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate comm then . "
A,Task,"Yes comm absolutely . "
B,Minor,"okay . "
A,Task,"Um comm basi basically what I basically what the what be having um comm I would say comm the the whole thing articulated at two points comm "
A,Task,"so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it "
A,Task,"so that the um the L_C_ the L_C_D_ and the uh "
A,Task,"The joystick would be in the right place . "
A,Task,"And also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"that it should be comm you know comm soft to touch "
A,Task,"and "
A,Task,"can be moved around all nice . "
A,Minor,"Um okay "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Um comm yeah . "
A,Task,"on to on to the next uh to the next slide . "
B,Task,"Just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well comm "
A,Other,"Okay . "
B,Task,"because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say comm I guess . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"'kay basically um "
A,Other,"I can add pretty pictures to this . "
A,Minor,"The um "
A,Task,"Assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position comm um hol uh holding the remote comm "
A,Task,"the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger "
A,Task,"so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . "
A,Task,"Um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that "
A,Task,"so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users . "
A,Minor,"So . "
A,Task,"You then have a grip section "
A,Task,"that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . "
A,Task,"You just have big two big buttons "
A,Task,"that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part comm one for the four finger comm one for the middle finger . "
A,Minor,"Um comm and that "
C,Elicit,"Is this the joystick ? "
A,Task,"Th this part here is the joystick . "
A,Task,"This would be the actual grip . "
A,Task,"Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Task,"That would be probably the bulkiest part . "
A,Task,"And you then have comm at the uh at the bottom comm the L_C_D_ comm "
A,Task,"and this would need to be articulated as well . "
A,Task,"And basically I'd want this to rest here comm right at the base of the wrist . "
A,Task,"So it would fit just nicely in the hand . "
A,Task,"And again comm this part could be "
A,Task,"rotated comm "
A,Task,"so it can So so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user . "
A,Minor,"Um So "
A,Task,"the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch "
A,Task,"and menu mode would be the enter button . "
A,Task,"And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . "
A,Minor,"Um now "
A,Minor,"programming it "
A,Task,"actually thi this is one thing I've found with um the replacement remote control . "
A,Task,"Programming them can be a right pain . "
A,Task,"So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer "
A,Task,"some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer "
A,Task,"just so that you could um pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface . "
A,Task,"And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers . "
A,Task,"Um though you i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer comm "
A,Task,"uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Um . But uh . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"That's that's my idea . "
B,Other,"Excellent comm "
B,Minor,"right . Um uh . "
C,Minor,"Mm . 'Kay . "
B,Other,"File open . "
C,Other,"We go . "
B,Other,"Trend watching . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So uh "
C,Task,"to gather my research comm two basic methods . "
C,Task,"We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . "
C,Task,"And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe comm "
C,Task,"what's what's the new black comm "
C,Minor,"you know comm "
C,Minor,"as it goes . "
C,Task,"Next slide please . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Uh we found comm in order of importance comm people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . "
C,Minor,"As in they want it to do a lot of good s "
C,Task,"they want it to look like it does a lot comm "
C,Task,"and if it does do a lot that's a bonus comm "
C,Task,"but they don't care so much comm "
C,Minor,"you know . "
C,Minor,"They want it to be "
C,Task,"that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . "
C,Task,"Technology technical technologically innovative . People want it to be that comm "
C,Task,"but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"like the interface is really important . "
C,Task,"And easy to use comm "
C,Task,"it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . "
C,Minor,"People want it I is "
C,Task,"it has to be cooler than easy to use comm "
C,Minor,"you know comm "
C,Task,"if it has the newest features comm even if it's difficult to use comm prefer it to have the newest features . "
C,Task,"And if it's easy to use that's a bonus . "
C,Task,"The fashion comm now this is seems a bit odd to me comm "
C,Task,"but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture comm for clothes comm for shoes . "
C,Task,"How that relates to a remote control I don't know . "
C,Minor,"But I I see "
C,Other,"I come on to that in the next in the next slide . "
C,Task,"Spongy . "
C,Task,"I've als I've been saying everything's the new black . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"spongy's the new black as well . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we have the choice between rubber and plastic . "
C,Elicit,"If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze comm you know comm it's spongy comm then can I skip the rest ? "
D,Minor,"Oh yeah comm "
D,Task,"I forgot to mention that . "
D,Task,"The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material comm not just normal rubber . "
C,Other,"Okay . Okay comm "
D,Task,"Forgot to say that . "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"kinda spongy material . "
C,Minor,"So um so "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Other,"my personal opinion ? "
C,Task,"Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative comm obviously . "
C,Task,"But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future "
C,Task,"that looks cool comm "
C,Task,"that's that's different comm "
C,Minor,"you know comm "
C,Minor,"that's "
C,Task,"everyone has a white remote control comm black remote control comm "
C,Task,"you need something cool . "
C,Task,"Like comm titanium is cool "
C,Task,"but it's expensive . "
C,Task,"And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control . "
C,Task,"Um now the fruit and veg options comm either we we go in that direction "
C,Task,"or we stay totally away from it . "
C,Task,"Um I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg comm "
C,Task,"so maybe it is important "
C,Minor,"for "
C,Task,"it's the up to the interface guy . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"if we stay away from it comm s you know stay away from it comm "
C,Task,"but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that comm or a kiwi fruit . "
C,Task,"It could be something like comm I say potato peeler "
C,Task,"but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"I think cool is the key . "
C,Task,"Few questions about a spongy remote control . "
C,Task,"I've never seen one before . "
C,Task,"I've seen plastic remote controls . "
C,Minor,"I think maybe they were "
C,Task,"I don't know comm "
C,Task,"back in the day when they first came up with remote controls comm they had a reason for it being "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"sturdy comm you know . For being strong and sturdy . "
C,Minor,"So um "
C,Task,"if we want something strong and sturdy comm I say stay with plastic or titanium comm "
C,Task,"but if we go with spongy comm we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want comm "
C,Task,"it doesn't matter comm "
C,Task,"it's spongy material comm "
C,Task,"it's not gonna break comm "
C,Minor,"you know . "
C,Task,"I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material "
C,Task,"because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Elicit,"how do things fit it ? "
C,Task,"And if we are gonna use spongy comm we can say it's long lasting comm "
C,Minor,"you know "
C,Task,"it's damage resistant and stuff like that comm "
C,Minor,"so . So "
C,Other,"just to summarise comm "
C,Task,"people want stuff that's cool comm "
C,Task,"that's that looks like it's cool comm "
C,Task,"and if it is cool then that's a bonus "
C,Minor,"doesn't have to be um "
C,Task,"people like fruit and veg . "
C,Task,"We can either go down that alley "
C,Task,"or stay totally away from it . "
C,Task,"People like spongy material . "
C,Task,"If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is comm "
C,Task,"and how we can further promote that idea . "
C,Task,"And also comm this was this year . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"things change all the time comm every year "
C,Minor,"you know "
C,Task,"they they always talk about this year comm this is the new black . "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"next year something else is gonna be the new black "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"That's me . "
B,Minor,"Well comm um "
B,Task,"I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway . "
B,Task,"You always have to bring out new designs comm "
B,Task,"so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway . Um . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf comm "
B,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"I don't exactly what cost would be incurred . "
B,Task,"Um I can see your point about the number keypad comm "
B,Minor,"but I've "
B,Task,"I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um boxes as well "
B,Task,"um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers "
B,Minor,"for you to be "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm actually "
A,Task,"if you've got a lot of channels comm the number keypad can be quite annoying as well comm "
A,Minor,"becau it's "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Task,"if you're trying to remember what uh comm you know comm what number's the discovery channel or whatever . It's just irritating . "
C,Task,"That's a good point . "
C,Task,"You can incorporate names into the menu . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"But if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure comm then you can sub-group them . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So you "
C,Task,"Even news comm music . Like they do on uh sky digital kinda . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Other,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components comm um comm "
B,Task,"say something like um lithium ion battery comm "
B,Task,"the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . Um "
B,Task,"Looks like we going for a double curved design . "
B,Task,"Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that . "
B,Task,"Um comm looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . "
B,Task,"Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is comm we might need to have some kind of inner frame . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"I I would say definitely comm "
A,Minor,"I mean I mean I mean "
A,Minor,"the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th "
A,Task,"there would be basically two points of articulation . W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip . "
B,Task,"Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? "
A,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"I can see why it looks appealing comm "
B,Elicit,"but it could be a weak point in um the structure comm do you think ? "
B,Task,"That would be a worry of mine . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
D,Task,"If you're going with the fruit and veg thing comm looks like a banana . "
D,Task,"F if you wanna design it that way . "
C,Minor,". "
A,Task,"I d I don't thi I don't think that it would be a a structural weakness comm "
A,Task,"I mean if you have a firm s sub-structure comm you can then incorporate articulation into that . "
A,Task,"If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible comm spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know "
A,Task,"organic comm "
A,Task,"and I think would look rather co I mean mi rather cool . "
A,Task,"I mean my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice comm "
A,Task,"it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control comm "
A,Minor,"but uh . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Other,"we won't add that functionality . "
C,Task,"Okay . Course not . "
B,Task,"However comm one interesting point is comm "
B,Task,"I don't know how serious you were there comm "
B,Minor,"but we "
B,Task,"if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Sure comm yeah . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
B,Task,"It's an certainly a different colour from your average um "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Make it harder to lose comm as well . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"That's true . "
C,Task,"Sure . "
B,Minor,"Was there anything in your research "
C,Task,"The noise for when you lose the banana comm um f yeah comm for when you lose the remote control comm it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that comm rather than a standard beep beep . "
C,Minor,"Y you know comm "
C,Task,"you lose the monkey the banana comm "
C,Task,"y you lose the banana comm "
D,Minor,"monkey . "
C,Task,"you press a button comm "
C,Task,"and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana . "
A,Minor,"I th uh I mean if it "
A,Task,"I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable comm "
A,Task,"though maybe have monkey as default . Um . "
C,Minor,"S "
C,Minor,"oh comm "
C,Task,"I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . "
C,Task,"Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s comm "
C,Minor,"you know "
C,Task,"you s you click a button "
C,Task,"and it finds the frequency "
C,Task,"that works with your particular television . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Elicit,"But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature comm "
C,Task,"I I don't know . "
A,Minor,"Well basi basically "
A,Minor,"the um for f for uh "
A,Minor,"I mean "
A,Task,"e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"It's not simply a matter of frequency . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi "
A,Task,"you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote comm "
A,Task,"and you'll have this little booklet of codes "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer "
A,Task,"and try the different codes "
A,Task,"that "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"come under that manufacturer's name "
A,Task,"'til you find the right one . "
C,Task,"That's because televisions comm they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm that's right . "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"So "
A,Task,"that's that's quite annoying "
A,Task,"and we probably would still have to do that . "
A,Task,"But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option comm then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing . "
B,Task,"An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer comm we can still make the process easier "
B,Task,"because instead of having to look up codes comm maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ "
B,Task,"and then they maybe look up different names of um different actual units that have been produced . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function comm and such . "
C,Elicit,"Is it is it actually a book of names to digits comm or is it like a few pages ? "
A,Task,"Um booklet . Some pages . "
C,Task,"I was just thinking comm if we were to store this information comm some type of mapping . "
C,Task,"This person probably need to use this feature like once comm you know comm when you first buy the remote control comm or whenever they buy a new television comm "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Minor,"once every s "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Doesn't have to be used very often "
B,Task,"that's right comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"and it's "
A,Task,"But it's a but it's a nuisance . "
A,Task,"And it's a nuisance very close to the to um to actually purchasing it comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about . "
A,Minor,"If you if there's w i "
A,Task,"if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance comm you might be favourably inclined towards it . Um mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm "
B,Minor,"this "
B,Task,"just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway . "
B,Task,"This is the conceptual one . Um . "
B,Minor,"I think we've come up "
B,Task,"I think we've covered everything we need to here . "
B,Task,"Um I think we've decided on what comm you know comm decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such comm "
B,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"we're now looking at the detailed design "
B,Task,"and what we need to be doing for the next meeting . "
B,Minor,"Um So for example comm um "
B,Other,"I'll just start at the top comm "
B,Task,"you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage "
B,Task,"'cause it'll be hard not to comm obviously . Um "
B,Task,"looking from prototyping of some des description using clay . "
B,Task,"Um I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh progress . Um "
B,Task,"The user interface design comm They're kind of it looks they're the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there comm "
B,Elicit,"whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate comm do you think ? "
B,Elicit,"Or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ? "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Um well "
A,Task,"I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it comm "
A,Task,"um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made comm I would say . "
A,Task,"Um but then again comm the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television comm and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . "
A,Minor,"So um "
A,Task,"and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it . "
B,Task,"Mm-hmm comm that's very true . "
B,Minor,"Um . Okay . Um "
B,Task,"got product evaluation as well . Um . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm "
C,Minor,"you see I don't "
C,Task,"some of these things kinda logically follow the others . "
C,Minor,"How can t "
C,Elicit,"product evaluation comm doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype . "
B,Minor,"I I think we'd be "
B,Minor,"yeah comm "
B,Task,"no comm "
B,Task,"it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with . "
C,Other,"Oh comm that's the okay comm sure sure sure . "
B,Minor,"Um so "
B,Task,"it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out comm "
B,Task,"uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"which I suppose is quite similar . "
B,Task,"Or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control comm what do you think of the look of it ? Um "
C,Other,"Okay comm sure . "
C,Task,"At this stage we still have no no target audience "
C,Minor,"or "
B,Task,"I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous . "
C,Task,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"Um the reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control comm "
B,Task,"something that's stylish comm "
B,Task,"so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying "
C,Task,"And it's stylish . "
B,Task,"if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then comm they've got a bit of free cash comm "
B,Task,"so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Maybe even single comm just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Although of course I mean at twenty five Euros comm I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device . "
C,Minor,"Yep . Okay . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Think that's well within the normal bracket . "
B,Task,"Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost . "
B,Task,"U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there comm "
B,Task,"but it might push the cost of the overall unit up "
B,Task,"'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . "
B,Minor,"That one might have to be based on "
C,Task,"Programmable memory as well . "
D,Elicit,"The U_S_B_ for which ? "
C,Task,"For the remote control . "
B,Task,"The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming "
D,Other,"Oh right comm okay . "
B,Task,"due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice comm easy minimal design comm normally . "
C,Minor,"We've w definitely talking some type of "
B,Minor,"Um . "
D,Elicit,"But didn't they just say it's just for T_V_ comm "
D,Minor,"or are we gonna "
B,Task,"It's just for T_V_ comm "
B,Task,"but for "
C,Task,"Different . "
B,Task,"programming it to use your T_V_ comm you might hook it up to the P_C_ . "
D,Other,"Okay comm yeah . "
B,Task,"I'm not sure comm but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"We don't know unless it would make sense to . "
C,Task,"But you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I mean it's "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Minor,"something that doesn't "
C,Task,"you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed comm you know comm once you turn off the power . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"The other thing "
A,Task,"I mean it I mean it would need to ha it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Um f for one for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be "
A,Task,"um uh I mean although you know comm it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device comm "
A,Task,"the menu system ought to be um "
A,Task,"o ought to be customisable "
A,Minor,"and uh "
C,Task,"Different languages comm uh different skins and stuff like that . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . W "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . How uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels . That sort of thing . "
C,Task,"Sure . "
C,Minor,"I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff comm that does open "
C,Task,"it is supposed to be international comm "
C,Elicit,"right ? "
C,Minor,"So . "
B,Task,"It would make sense to . I would say to . "
C,Task,"It would make sense if you could "
B,Task,"Um and we'd better be careful about the time as well . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"We've already had the five minute warning comm "
B,Minor,"so . Um . "
B,Task,"I would say yeah . "
B,Task,"International would make sense . "
B,Task,"Um you're gonna look at product evaluation . "
B,Minor,"I'm "
B,Other,"I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . "
B,Task,"Um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say . "
B,Task,"Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Uh we'll see how that goes . Um . "
A,Elicit,"Are we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know . "
A,Elicit,"Where is the clay ? "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Minor,"do "
B,Task,"I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting comm "
B,Elicit,"would you say ? "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Elicit,"they're going with the fashion thing comm like the design comm spongy rubber . "
C,Elicit,"The fruit and veg . "
C,Task,"This one . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Mm . I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm I would s that would be my my feeling . "
A,Task,"Bu but um but the spongy idea I like . I like it a lot . "
B,Elicit,"We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea comm "
A,Task,"though maybe we could have options for colours as well . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose . "
C,Task,"Sure . "
C,Task,"I mean we are trying to promote a remote control comm "
C,Task,"but we wanna keep the company brand as well comm "
C,Minor,"so . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Elicit,"So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . "
B,Task,"Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . Um . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"I was like "
A,Task,"like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"And I think that says it all really . "
C,Task,"I think so too . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"See everybody in a half hour . "
C,Minor,"Sa "
