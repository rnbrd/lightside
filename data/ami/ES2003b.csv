C,Task,"Just put it on the deskt desktop . "
B,Task,"No "
B,Task,"on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link . "
B,Minor,"A "
B,Minor,"well "
B,Task,"actually just there . "
C,Task,"Project documents comm "
C,Other,"yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah . That's it . "
B,Task,"If you dump it in there . "
C,Elicit,"What's your username ? "
B,Other,"Your username . "
C,Elicit,"What's your username and password ? "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Other,"Sorry . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
C,Task,"There we go . "
B,Other,"Excellent . "
B,Minor,"Right . "
B,Task,"Hopefully that's us ready to uh to go . "
B,Minor,"So . "
B,Task,"Functional design meeting . "
B,Task,"We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff . Um "
B,Task,"we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . "
B,Task,"Not a lot thankfully to say . "
B,Task,"We introduced ourselves comm "
B,Task,"discussed the possibility of a macro facility comm interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more comm um mentioning of bar-code comm joystick for user manipulation comm um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . "
B,Task,"Um it's come to my attention the following . "
B,Task,"Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . "
B,Task,"Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . "
B,Task,"Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable comm "
B,Task,"um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . "
B,Minor,"Um . Now . "
B,Task,"Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Task,"to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . "
B,Task,"Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . "
B,Task,"Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . "
B,Task,"Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first comm "
C,Task,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Other,"I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want . "
C,Task,"Sure . "
C,Minor,"Um comm sh would you like to "
C,Other,"I'll just do it from here . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Elicit,"Uh . Is yours the "
C,Task,"Um comm try second one maybe . "
C,Task,"Try it comm "
C,Task,"yeah maybe . "
B,Other,"Oh "
B,Other,"sorry . "
C,Task,"Yeah . Okay . "
B,Task,"Okay comm right . "
C,Task,"Oh comm I thought I put in my last name comm "
C,Task,"I guess not comm "
C,Minor,"but . "
B,Minor,"Uh if you "
B,Other,"that's all right . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"If you "
B,Elicit,"do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ? "
C,Task,"Oh yeah comm that'd be fine comm that'd be great . "
B,Other,"Yeah ? "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Functional requirement by me Ebenezer . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"Okay comm so um "
C,Task,"we did some research comm "
C,Task,"we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . "
C,Task,"We asked some uh open ended questions comm "
C,Task,"just comm what are your opinions on the remote control comm "
C,Task,"got a lot of re responses comm "
C,Task,"and we asked some very specific questions comm "
C,Task,"and we got a lot of good feedback . "
C,Task,"Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people comm "
C,Task,"so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five comm twenty five to thirty five comm there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group . "
C,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Minor,"we got "
C,Task,"some the bad stuff we got comm "
C,Task,"remotes are often lost . "
C,Task,"I often lose my remote control comm the back of the couch comm some place comm "
C,Task,"and even if it's not lost permanently comm it takes me a few minutes to find it . "
C,Task,"Most buttons are not used any more comm "
C,Task,"like you said comm teletext is outdated now . "
C,Task,"I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently comm "
C,Task,"and there were so many buttons comm "
C,Task,"it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button comm "
C,Task,"'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons comm "
C,Minor,"you know "
C,Task,"there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . "
C,Task,"And if they do comm not very often . "
C,Task,"Takes too long to master the remote control . "
C,Task,"I've seen some remote controls that are big comm "
C,Task,"they have a lot of buttons comm "
C,Task,"you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something comm "
C,Task,"they're just not great to use . "
C,Task,"We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls comm "
C,Task,"people do not like remote controls . "
C,Task,"Some of the good stuff we got . "
C,Task,"Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five comm most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . "
C,Task,"Now don't get excited yet comm "
C,Other,"I've got more to say on that . "
C,Task,"Most people'd be willing to pay for that "
C,Task,"um most people want remote controls to be pretty comm "
C,Task,"they want it to be fancy comm "
C,Task,"th they they want it to be different comm "
C,Task,"everybody has a white remote control with black buttons comm and a red button and a green button comm "
C,Task,"not everybody wants that . "
C,Other,"Finally comm my opinion . "
B,Minor,"Yep . "
C,Task,"The voice recognition thing is cool . "
C,Task,"And uh voice recognition comm the software comm open source software exist already . "
C,Task,"It's a bit sketchy at some times comm uh comm you're not gonna get good always accurate results comm "
C,Minor,"but for a very fixed number of words comm "
C,Minor,"you know "
C,Minor,"you have comm "
C,Elicit,"how many different words can you have for a remote control comm "
C,Task,"up comm down comm left comm right comm channel five comm channel seven comm "
C,Minor,"you know comm "
C,Minor,"how many comm "
C,Task,"you can't have that many words . "
C,Task,"For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . "
C,Task,"I'm pretty sure people would buy it . "
C,Task,"But after a while people may wanna return it comm "
C,Minor,"because if you have to to say som "
C,Task,"I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels comm "
C,Task,"and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . "
C,Task,"Using the remote control comm ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels comm "
C,Task,"and that's for flickering through channels . "
C,Task,"So if you have to say up comm up comm up comm up comm if you have to do that all the time comm then people might get a bit fed up with that "
C,Task,"and they may return it . "
C,Task,"However comm oh comm because the voice recognition software exists already comm "
C,Task,"there's no need to spend money on research and development comm "
C,Task,"but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control comm "
C,Task,"which is an unusual feature in my opinion . "
C,Task,"But if we do have the voice recognition thing comm there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . "
C,Minor,"See comm you could "
C,Task,"there're two options . "
C,Task,"Either you have voice recognition by itself comm "
C,Task,"which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet comm "
C,Task,"or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you comm it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . "
C,Task,"So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . "
C,Task,"But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part comm then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look comm "
C,Task,"because there are no restrictions on physical size comm or shape comm "
C,Task,"it it could be as fancy as you want it to be comm "
C,Minor,"you know comm "
C,Task,"it could be like a lollipop or something like that comm something weird like that . "
C,Task,"As long as the voice recognition stuff works comm that's that's fine . "
B,Minor,"Okay comm yep . "
C,Minor,"So "
C,Task,"we have the three birds comm "
C,Task,"we have the design comm "
C,Minor,"that "
C,Task,"we have the the fancy bit comm "
C,Elicit,"right comm "
C,Task,"the voice recognition's fancy comm "
C,Task,"it's cool comm "
C,Task,"it's different comm "
C,Task,"it's radical comm "
C,Minor,"so comm "
C,Task,"and then we have an extra bit "
C,Task,"I don't remember "
C,Minor,"so "
C,Task,"I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote comm "
C,Elicit,"but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control comm "
C,Task,"I think is a big question . "
C,Elicit,"Um comm will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote comm "
C,Task,"'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user comm "
C,Elicit,"but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait comm "
C,Elicit,"are you willing to have a bad remote control . "
C,Elicit,"And uh what if you have visitors come round comm "
C,Task,"they stay the night comm "
C,Task,"they wanna use the T_V_ comm they can't use the remote "
C,Task,"because they speak differently to you . "
C,Elicit,"Um comm how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . "
C,Elicit,"Uh comm will people return the remote control comm "
C,Task,"I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control comm if they have the money comm "
C,Minor,"you know comm so comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . If you could uh "
C,Task,"do our audience have the money comm "
C,Elicit,"but would they return it after a while "
C,Task,"because it's not as fast as pressing a button comm "
C,Task,"it's not a practical . "
C,Minor,"So . "
C,Task,"These are things I think we should consider . "
C,Task,"I think it's cool comm "
B,Other,"sor "
B,Task,"if you could speed it up a bit comm yeah . "
C,Other,"I'm sorry ? "
B,Task,"If you could uh speed it up a bit please comm yeah . "
C,Task,"Sure . "
C,Task,"I'm about to end comm yeah . "
B,Other,"Sorry . "
B,Task,"Cool . "
C,Task,"I think it's cool "
C,Task,"but there are definitely some considerations . "
B,Task,"Okay . Excellent . "
C,Minor,"So comm "
C,Task,"yeah . "
B,Minor,"Right . Um . "
B,Task,"Hear from the User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Um comm you've got your presentation now comm "
D,Minor,"How did where did "
A,Task,"Yeah comm "
B,Minor,"is it on the "
A,Task,"it's in the it's in the folder "
D,Elicit,"where did you get all your in information ? "
A,Task,"yeah . "
B,Elicit,"is it ? "
B,Other,"Okay . "
C,Task,"There was uh a website comm uh comm "
D,Other,"Oh . "
C,Task,"right here . "
D,Other,"Ah comm okay . "
B,Elicit,"Technical functions ? "
A,Task,"Mm . "
B,Other,"No . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay comm "
A,Task,"this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote . "
A,Minor,"As um is uh the the "
A,Task,"the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete "
A,Task,"because I had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices "
A,Task,"but uh there's still stuff of relevance comm "
A,Minor,"so "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Other,"press on . "
A,Task,"I've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . Um "
A,Task,"and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say "
A,Task,"so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on . "
A,Task,"Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance comm in this case the television set . "
A,Task,"Um to save you getting off your backside . "
A,Task,"Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . "
A,Task,"On the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it "
A,Task,"so about the size of the television set . "
A,Task,"Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has comm the remote control controls . "
A,Task,"And most of these functions are not going to be used comm "
A,Task,"it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . "
A,Task,"And on the other hand there's a user focused approach "
A,Task,"that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used . Um "
A,Minor,"With uh a and a "
A,Task,"and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously comm "
A,Task,"but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . "
A,Task,"And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use comm "
A,Task,"and um well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume . "
A,Task,"Um and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a D_V_ D_V_D_ or uh V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play comm pause comm stop comm rewind comm fast-forward comm record comm so forth . Um . "
A,Task,"My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . "
A,Task,"Um but uh the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance "
A,Task,"about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most . "
A,Minor,"So comm "
A,Task,"something that's uh something that is more programmable comm "
A,Task,"that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it "
A,Task,"but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . "
A,Task,"Um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls comm "
A,Task,"um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons comm "
A,Minor,"and have a disp "
A,Task,"you then have some sort of basic display on it "
A,Task,"so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . "
A,Task,"Um comm this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"you know "
A,Task,"the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons "
A,Task,"that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes "
A,Minor,"but the "
A,Task,"and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified . "
A,Task,"And so it's taking taking the lead from that . "
A,Minor,"Um . "
B,Minor,"Okay . Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Right . Um comm "
A,Task,"That's it . "
B,Task,"if we could hear from our Industrial engineer comm or Designer . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Uh comm I was still working on stuff comm "
D,Task,"I hadn't got it finished . "
D,Minor,"Um comm alright . "
D,Other,"Click to save in "
D,Elicit,"where do I have to save it ? "
B,Task,"If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder comm or project documents . "
B,Task,"If you save it in there we can open it up from here . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm what I've done with it comm "
D,Other,"I'm sorry . "
D,Other,"Shit . "
D,Minor,"Um "
B,Elicit,"Are you finding it okay "
B,Minor,"or ? "
D,Other,"I'm just closing it now . "
D,Task,"where I've saved it . "
C,Minor,"Well like "
C,Task,"if you go to one comm uh whichever one you were working "
D,Task,"that's it there comm "
D,Task,"yeah . "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Task,"and you just click file save as . "
D,Task,"Oh right . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"Uh comm right "
D,Task,"I'm responsible for working design comm "
D,Task,"uh comm this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control . "
D,Task,"So we have the energy source comm "
D,Task,"we have the user interface comm "
D,Task,"this this is what I've seen . "
D,Task,"Uh the sender will push the button comm "
D,Task,"the chip will respond comm "
D,Task,"uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_ . "
D,Minor,"So uh uh comm "
D,Task,"if you go to next slide comm "
D,Task,"you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface . "
D,Elicit,"Do we need uh many buttons comm "
D,Elicit,"or do we need l many light bulbs "
D,Task,"that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not . "
D,Elicit,"Um comm comm or would that take too much power comm "
D,Elicit,"would we need more um components in there to supply the power ? "
D,Task,"Um comm the joystick is another thing comm "
D,Task,"if we were gonna add that comm um comm there'd be more components to deal with that . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
D,Minor,"Um comm so uh "
D,Minor,"we need to "
D,Task,"I dunno exactly what "
D,Task,"That's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design comm "
D,Task,"um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Minor,"So comm "
D,Task,"that'll be decided comm I guess . "
D,Task,"Uh comm and the next slide . "
D,Minor,"Oh comm yeah Um comm "
D,Task,"if you go to the next slide then . "
B,Other,"Oh . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"I just used the "
D,Other,"it was a mess comm "
D,Task,"uh I was just putting adding it together at the end there . Uh "
B,Minor,"Ah comm "
B,Other,"don't worry about it at all mate . "
D,Minor,"Uh so "
D,Task,"you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip comm "
D,Task,"and the user interface obviously contains everything . "
D,Task,"You have the switch turn it on comm "
D,Task,"infrared bulb comm uh will contact the T_V_ "
D,Task,"and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player comm the bulb will turn on to say it's on . "
D,Minor,"Uh comm so "
D,Elicit,"do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide comm or different light bulbs comm "
D,Elicit,"would it be easier ? "
D,Task,"Um comm I dunno what we should decide on that . "
B,Minor,"Okay . Well . "
B,Other,"Oh sorry comm "
B,Elicit,"I'm I'm interrupting you . "
B,Minor,"Are you is it "
D,Task,"No comm "
D,Task,"it's finished comm yeah . "
B,Other,"yeah ? "
B,Minor,"Okay . Right . Um comm right "
B,Task,"we can probably skip that for now . "
B,Minor,"So comm "
B,Task,"we've had some stuff put forward comm um "
B,Task,"along with the new user requirements comm "
B,Task,"um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far . Um "
B,Task,"I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about um voice activated control . "
B,Task,"However I've got a couple of worries about that . "
B,Task,"The power required comm um and the ability to the cost comm it seems like for uh an embedded system comm this could cause us issues . "
D,Task,"Cost . Mm . "
B,Task,"Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice comm "
B,Task,"I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"but these require a lot of memory "
B,Task,"and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . "
B,Task,"Um voice activation could be an interesting idea "
B,Task,"but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible . "
C,Minor,"'Kay . "
B,Task,"Um that's just my view right now comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far comm "
B,Minor,"it's almost like having a small "
B,Minor,"T_ not T_V_ to say comm "
B,Task,"but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display comm I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"but it might be quite low ? "
D,Elicit,"L_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on comm or uh comm interactive L_C_D_ or "
C,Minor,"I uh "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone comm "
B,Task,"something where you can read an an um fair amount of information comm "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"traverse maybe quite a few menus comm "
B,Task,"if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example comm "
B,Task,"they usually incorporate they have the keypad comm "
B,Task,"and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"That could be one possibility . "
B,Task,"Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say comm volume control comm changing channels "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"I I was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume comm left and right for channels . "
B,Minor,"We "
D,Elicit,"Do you think that people will get mixed up comm "
D,Minor,"like comm "
D,Task,"they'll be looking at this screen and that screen "
D,Task,"and then comm you know comm trying to get everything working comm "
D,Elicit,"would it be a bit confusing ? "
A,Task,"Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"um but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing comm um . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"And I think and I think that size of uh display was about what I had in mind . "
A,Minor,"Um though I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo "
A,Task,"most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour "
A,Task,"but we should probably try to stick to black and white . "
B,Task,"I would agree with you . "
A,Task,"Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . "
A,Task,"Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development "
A,Task,"but uh you know cost a bit of extra money "
A,Minor,"f w w w w w "
A,Task,"once everyone's got the first comm you know comm oh colour's out comm we'll have to replace it "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Elicit,"won't we . "
A,Task,"It does nothing extra . "
B,Task,"That would be my feeling as well comm "
B,Task,"I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface . "
B,Minor,"Um now I mean "
C,Minor,"Sure "
C,Task,"but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one comm "
B,Minor,"I don't "
B,Other,"sorry comm "
B,Task,"go for it . "
C,Task,"but I think we don't have a specific audience comm "
C,Minor,"you know comm "
C,Elicit,"like what is our target audience comm "
C,Elicit,"what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner . "
C,Minor,"You know comm "
C,Elicit,"you know what I'm saying comm "
C,Minor,"like comm "
C,Elicit,"for whom is this intended ? "
C,Elicit,"Everybody ? "
B,Task,"I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . "
B,Task,"And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people . "
C,Other,"Most people comm yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm if we are if we were to follow that avenue comm we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"But that does cover a very large section of the people out there . "
C,Task,"Sure . I think that's fair yeah . "
B,Minor,"Um comm I mean "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . "
B,Task,"Which maybe doesn't get used as often comm "
B,Task,"maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off comm d up and down comm "
B,Other,"it depends comm "
B,Minor,"I mean "
B,Task,"maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then comm "
B,Task,"that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"So like "
B,Task,"we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control . "
B,Task,"So that literally anybody can come along comm pick up the remote and still know what do do . "
B,Task,"And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T_V_ "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and who would normally use the unit . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Mm . I th the thing I like about the uh the uh joystick "
B,Task,"I dunno . "
A,Minor,"is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for for T_ T_ for T_V_ remote alone comm you could put "
A,Minor,"um I mean there are like I say the the "
A,Task,"the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel . "
A,Task,"You can pack all that onto was onto a single control . Um . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"But uh but the but then o uh obviously if "
A,Minor,"uh you know "
A,Task,"if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation . "
A,Task,"I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with comm most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway "
A,Task,"so this would be a fairly rational way of integra "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling . Um "
A,Task,"concern about our market . "
A,Minor,"Um comm if we are "
A,Task,"I mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation . "
A,Task,"Um comm you've got twenty different devices in your living room comm "
C,Minor,"Yeah . Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Um comm if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room comm um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else . "
A,Minor,"I just think that uh possibly "
B,Minor,"Well "
B,Task,"this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid comm "
A,Minor,"mm . "
B,Task,"this isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed comm for now . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Minor,"So "
B,Other,"I can understand your point comm "
B,Task,"and I would agree with you comm "
B,Task,"but this is our design spec for now . "
B,Other,"'Fraid to say . "
B,Minor,"Um "
A,Minor,"Does that "
A,Elicit,"um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ? "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"I would say so comm yes comm "
B,Task,"because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes comm "
B,Task,"and that is a separate unit . "
B,Minor,"Um I think that it "
B,Task,"I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that . "
C,Other,"Hmm . Okay comm specifically television . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Task,"Maybe we'll hear differently comm "
B,Minor,"but for now "
C,Elicit,"So the joystick is just for differentness . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"It would be ease of manipulation of certain functions comm yes . Um "
C,Other,"Okay . "
A,Other,"Just a thought . "
A,Task,"Um maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers comm rather than the public . "
A,Task,"Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with um "
B,Task,"There is that possibility comm yes . "
B,Minor,"B "
B,Task,"However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that comm "
B,Task,"but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert comm "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"that might be sales comm "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"who are not in this meeting . "
C,Task,"It's just comm the way I figure it comm twelve point five Euros per unit comm we have to sell at least like three million or something like that comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys comm "
C,Minor,"you know comm like "
C,Task,"if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it comm then we have to sell a lot of remote controls . "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Minor,"We just "
C,Elicit,"Is this gonna be enough to to sell ? "
B,Minor,"Well comm "
B,Task,"something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote comm "
B,Task,"which as you said you've done comm "
B,Task,"in fact we've probably all done . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Um comm I don't know if it's a gimmick or not comm "
B,Elicit,"but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings "
B,Task,"where if you whistle comm it will beep and you tell you where it is . "
C,Task,"I had one of those comm "
A,Task,"Mm comm yeah comm I've seen them . "
C,Task,"and my brother comm and my dad comm could have beat me up "
B,Minor,"Um . Well "
C,Task,"because it it went off all the time accidentally . "
B,Task,"the other option of course is that um the "
C,Task,"The clapping one . "
B,Minor,"well "
B,Task,"I was going to say clapping comm um "
B,Minor,"Um digital telephones comm uh for example comm one unit has "
B,Task,"of course you have to have that base unit comm "
B,Task,"somewhere where there's a button comm "
B,Task,"but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ . "
C,Task,"To a television . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Something which you when you press that comm it would beep to give its location away comm on the remote unit . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"And that could be something could um separate us a bit . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm I think that's a good idea . "
C,Task,"Yeah comm that's a good idea . "
B,Task,"And that way comm because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ comm "
B,Task,"again say what comm it would be a small transmitter comm um watch battery type scenario I would say comm "
B,Task,"or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't power "
B,Task,"that might be something that we could look into . "
D,Task,"Yeah "
B,Elicit,"Yep . "
B,Minor,"Yeah comm "
B,Task,"it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there comm "
B,Minor,"so I mean "
B,Task,"that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well . "
C,Task,"I think so comm yeah . "
B,Minor,"So . "
B,Task,"To go on from here . "
B,Task,"Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . "
B,Task,"Before we leave this meeting comm it would be best to say this is what we're going "
B,Task,"this is the design we're gonna try and get comm "
B,Task,"this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique . "
B,Minor,"Do we go for maybe a remote contro "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Other,"uh sorry comm "
B,Task,"we're gonna go for a remote control obviously comm "
B,Elicit,"do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels comm up and down comm "
B,Elicit,"and then comm what comm another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ . "
A,Minor,"Mm yeah . "
D,Other,"We're just saying volume . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm "
A,Minor,"I think that's "
D,Elicit,"Should volume be important in the joystick comm do you think ? "
B,Task,"We could use say the left and right for changing channels "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"and the up and down for volume comm "
A,Task,"For volume . "
D,Other,"Yep . "
C,Task,"But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most . "
B,Minor,"and "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
C,Task,"Um comm power is used like once per hour comm "
D,Minor,"I "
C,Task,"channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour comm "
B,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"that's by far the biggest one comm "
C,Task,"and then teletext comm is still here comm "
C,Task,"that's like fourteen comm "
B,Other,"Vol Volume selection okay comm yep comm "
C,Task,"and volume selection . "
B,Task,"the teletext we're gambling with comm "
B,Task,"and we're gonna say it's dead comm the way of the dodo "
C,Minor,"No comm "
C,Minor,"yeah comm "
C,Other,"okay okay . "
C,Minor,"Yeah comm um "
B,Minor,"So we "
B,Minor,"well comm "
B,Other,"sorry comm "
B,Task,"we could maybe even go as far as saying power button comm small joystick comm L_C_D_ comm "
B,Elicit,"and then what "
B,Task,"maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system comm "
B,Task,"and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? "
B,Task,"So we're having very very few buttons involved comm "
A,Minor,"Actually how "
B,Task,"but navigation around a menu for most things . "
A,Task,"Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons comm the y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button . "
A,Task,"I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Or vice versa . "
A,Task,"And that's really irritating . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly comm "
A,Task,"um comm so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick comm you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand "
A,Task,"and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"So um "
B,Task,"we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . "
B,Elicit,"Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? "
D,Task,"Yeah comm think so . "
B,Minor,"Do you mind looking ? "
C,Task,"Um comm I think because it's so small "
C,Minor,"it might be an "
C,Task,"uh I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that "
B,Elicit,"The ability to locate it again . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ comm "
B,Task,"just so that it says find me comm "
B,Task,"and what comm a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit comm "
B,Task,"can maybe hide it in the base . "
D,Task,"Light bulb as well comm "
A,Minor,"Oh . So so "
D,Elicit,"no ? "
B,Other,"Sorry ? "
A,Task,"a small speaker you mean . "
C,Task,"Speaker "
B,Task,"Some speaker comm "
B,Other,"sorry comm "
B,Task,"yeah . "
C,Task,"yeah . "
D,Task,"And a light bulb ? "
D,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"To flash . "
D,Task,"No . "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Task,"Nah comm "
D,Task,"you'd see it anyway comm if you hear it . "
B,Minor,"E us "
B,Task,"we might be better with the sound possibly "
C,Minor,"W "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"we could maybe incorporate "
C,Task,"those little key-rings have both comm "
C,Minor,"so "
B,Task,"th e the true fact comm considering the cost of an L_E_D_ comm we could just incorporate it anyway . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Um . So "
A,Task,"Blue ones particularly . "
A,Task,"Plus that's a nice wee design touch . "
C,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"by the sounds of it comm with what we're suggesting so far comm your design um the user interface is still quite open comm "
B,Task,"you could go for quite an interesting design . "
B,Task,"Because we're only going to have a very few key "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and you've got "
B,Task,"you know a small L_C_D_ comm joystick comm "
B,Minor,"e "
B,Task,"I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes comm "
B,Task,"something that can make it stand out slightly . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"Um if you could look into what we've suggested so far comm the feasibility of um small transmitter comm um and such comm maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power comm or such . "
B,Elicit,"Ebenezer comm um comm Marketing Expert "
C,Minor,"Well "
C,Task,"I can give you the frequency comm what people what options people use most often comm "
C,Task,"I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface comm "
C,Elicit,"right . "
C,Elicit,"You want the stuff . "
B,Minor,"If comm "
B,Task,"yeah "
B,Task,"if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken comm "
B,Task,"where of a joystick to control the very basic functions comm "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile . "
C,Task,"Okay . "
B,Task,"I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame comm "
B,Task,"but could be something we could maybe look into . "
C,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
C,Task,"Sure . Sure . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ? "
B,Elicit,"Anything that they think has been missed out . "
B,Task,"Bit of a wide open question there of course . "
C,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible . "
C,Task,"Sure . 'Kay . Yeah . "
B,Task,"Right . "
D,Minor,"So "
D,Elicit,"I should just look at um the speaker comm the speaker and an L_E_D_ . "
D,Minor,"And "
B,Task,"Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating comm um comm "
D,Task,"Yeah comm "
C,Task,"Transmitter . "
D,Task,"and a transmitter . "
B,Task,"transmitter "
A,Other,"Actually one one wee thought about that . "
A,Task,"Um comm if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television . "
B,Minor,"getting the external power source comm "
B,Task,"yep comm that's quite true . "
B,Task,"Um comm and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally comm "
B,Task,"makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control comm "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"so that's good . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Elicit,"'Kay . "
A,Minor,"You know I think "
D,Minor,"P "
A,Task,"I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that comm save us the bother comm then that's you know vast amounts of sales . Quite quickly . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm "
B,Task,"one thing that we've almost not talked about at all comm "
B,Other,"my apologies for that comm "
B,Task,"um comm user interface comm we also need to maybe get the slogan in here comm "
B,Minor,"um it's comm "
D,Task,"Fashion . "
B,Task,"I'm pointing at my laptop comm "
B,Other,"what in God "
B,Task,"Real reaction comm and such . "
B,Minor,"So um "
D,Minor,"The slogan is "
D,Minor,"yeah comm "
B,Other,"Oh comm sorry . "
D,Task,"the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics comm "
D,Elicit,"isn't it ? "
B,Other,"My apologies . "
B,Minor,"No "
B,Task,"it could well be comm "
B,Task,"I've probably missed that . "
B,Task,"Um comm I think that's l almost the last minute thing "
D,Other,"'S also look cool . "
B,Task,"we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top . "
B,Task,"So I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that . "
A,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Task,"But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ? "
B,Task,"In fact we might like to put a slogan on comm "
A,Task,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Task,"and um possibly the two R_s to signify the company . Rather than real reaction . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Mm . Yeah . "
A,Task,"I thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button . "
B,Task,"Sounds good . "
B,Task,"And I'd say that that's us for now . "
A,Minor,". "
B,Task,"Okay . "
