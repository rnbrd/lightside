D,Other,"Hello . "
D,Other,"Dang it . "
A,Task,"And then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"It's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Other,"No comm that's okay . "
B,Elicit,"Joost comm your mouse . "
D,Other,"What ? "
B,Elicit,"No mouse needed ? "
D,Task,"I've got a touch-pad . "
D,Elicit,"Do you know how how I can wake it up ? "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
B,Elicit,"A touch-pad ? "
D,Task,"No comm my laptop . "
B,Other,"Slap it . "
D,Other,"You with your brilliant ideas . "
D,Task,"I don't know if I can touch the power button . "
D,Elicit,"Do you know how how I can wake it up ? "
B,Minor,"Is "
A,Task,"No . Yeah . Try the power button . "
D,Other,"Oh . "
D,Other,"Come on comm move it . "
B,Minor,"Um "
D,Other,"Now comm wake up comm bitch . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Task,"F_ five . "
B,Task,"F_ five . "
C,Task,"I've lost my screen . Uh "
D,Task,"Yeah comm so did I . "
D,Task,"I closed it . "
B,Minor,"I don't . "
D,Task,"That wasn that wasn't very smart comm I guess . "
D,Other,"Come on . Get back to me . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"I closed the "
D,Task,"I closed it . "
B,Task,"You've got your name . "

D,Task,"Alright . "
C,Task,"No . "
B,Task,"Never close your laptop . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? Everybody's ready ? "
D,Task,"Great . Thanks . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Great . "
A,Task,"Well comm welcome to the kick-off meeting . "
A,Task,"I uh forgot to put my name over here comm "
A,Task,"it's uh it's Martin . "
A,Task,"Uh comm so you all know . "
A,Task,"Well comm this is the agenda for today . "
A,Task,"Well comm the opening is what I'm doing right now . "
A,Task,"Uh comm we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things . "
A,Task,"Uh give some um "
A,Task,"examples of the tool training comm project plan discussion and the closing . "
A,Task,"We have twenty five minutes . "
A,Task,"Okay comm the project aim is to design a new remote control . "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"Uh comm some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original comm trendy comm and user-friendly . "
A,Task,"So now we all know what our "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"goal is . "
A,Task,"Um comm I oh forget I forget the whole acquaintance part comm but we we all know each other . "
A,Task,"We all know each other's names . "
A,Task,"Joost comm Guido comm Antek . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Elicit,"What is your name ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
C,Task,"Antek . "
B,Task,"Antek Ahmet . And Joost . "
A,Task,"Okay . I think we uh al already uh been through that part . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay comm it consists of uh three levels of design . "
A,Task,"Uh we begin with the functional design comm then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . "
A,Task,"Every uh level of design consists of some individual work comm and we uh close it with a meeting . "
A,Task,"You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions comm "
A,Task,"and uh you p you probably read that already comm "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yes . "
A,Task,"so I don't have to tell you about that . "
A,Task,"Okay comm first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here comm so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . "
A,Task,"We have the smart-boards comm uh the thes those two boards . "
A,Task,"This is the presentation boards comm wh which one I'm using right now . "
A,Minor,"You can uh um "
A,Task,"there's a document folder called um the sh shared document folder . "
A,Task,"You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here comm "
A,Task,"so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . "
A,Task,"We also have the white-board . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm we're gonna skip through th "
B,Elicit,"Can we see the white-board on our laptops ? "
A,Task,"No comm no . Just on the on the screen over there . "
B,Task,"No comm I saw I saw the file comm the smart-board that X_B_K_ but "
A,Task,"Oh comm no . Probably is comm but I don't know if the software is on the laptop . "
A,Minor,"Is is if "
A,Task,"it's mainly a thing for in the meeting comm so I don't think it's I don't know if it's important . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"This an explanation of the smart-boards . "
A,Task,"There is a tool-bar over here . "
A,Task,"It's quite simple . "
A,Task,"You have the the pen function comm eraser function . "
A,Task,"It's like a very simple uh paint application . "
A,Minor,"Uh comm we well comm "
A,Task,"we use the same file during uh the whole day comm "
A,Task,"and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . "
A,Task,"It works like this . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"If pen is selected comm yes . "
A,Task,"Oh comm no no . "
B,Elicit,"With that pen ? "
A,Task,"It's not But it is pen . "
A,Task,"It's not working like a pen yet . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
B,Minor,"Mm . "
A,Task,"It's doing some stuff now . "
B,Task,"Little bit slower . "
A,Task,"So you can use a pen . "
A,Task,"You can use an eraser . "
A,Task,"And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks comm "
A,Task,"and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward comm "
A,Task,"which y you have to select pen format . And then select current colour or line width . "
A,Task,"So comm it's quite easy . "
A,Task,"Uh well comm now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools . "
A,Task,"Right comm we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . "
A,Task,"Uh comm every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics comm "
A,Task,"on blank sheets with different colours comm with different pen widths . "
A,Other,"Uh comm I'll start off then . "
A,Other,"I'll use this uh same sheet . "
A,Other,"Alright . "
A,Other,"Oh comm let me think . "
A,Other,"Different colours . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Other,"Well comm I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh comm a fish . "
B,Task,"piranha . Okay . "
A,Minor,"Uh . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
B,Minor,"Oh . "
A,Other,"I'm gonna use some different colour now . "
A,Task,"Some a little white . "
A,Task,"Looks like a fish . "
A,Other,"Think it is . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Other,"Uh comm colour . "
A,Elicit,"This is black ? "
A,Task,"I think so . "
B,Task,"Yellow "
A,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"Oh comm this is just uh useless uh drawings but "
A,Other,"Oh teeth . I need teeth . "
A,Task,"Well comm they're not supposed to be green comm or whatever colour this is . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"What was uh "
A,Task,"I have su to sum up its favourite characteris "
B,Task,"Different . "
A,Task,"Well comm I like its uh sharp razor sharp teeth . "
A,Task,"Plus comm uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh comm well a small actual face . "
A,Task,"And I like its overall uh aggressive look and "
A,Task,"Well comm that's what I like about uh piranha . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be . "
A,Elicit,"Well comm who wants to be next ? "
D,Other,"Nobody comm I guess . "
B,Other,"I will try . Yeah . I will try . Uh "
A,Task,"You go comm Guido ? Okay . "
A,Task,"Uh comm make a new sheet . "
A,Task,"Uh comm it's by pressing on blank . "
B,Elicit,"Blank ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
B,Elicit,"Then pen again ? "
A,Task,"Yep . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths . "
B,Task,"Okay comm "
B,Minor,"um "
D,Task,"Format . "
B,Other,"control . "
B,Minor,"Uh "
B,Other,"Ah comm purple . "
B,Task,"Um comm I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is comm "
B,Task,"but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird . "
B,Minor,"Uh I will "
D,Task,"You know comm I thought of that actually . "
B,Task,"That's my bird . "
B,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Minor,"Isn't it quite "
B,Task,"it's a little bit light . "
B,Other,"Uh comm another colour maybe . A red one . "
B,Other,"A small one . "
B,Other,"Uh comm line width . "
B,Other,"Two ? Three . "
B,Other,"Oh that's okay . "
B,Task,"That's another one . "
A,Task,"Well comm tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds . "
B,Minor,"Ano Uh uh it's a "
D,Task,"Its simplicity . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's uh the most simple uh animal I know comm I think . "
B,Task,"Um comm I don't know . "
B,Task,"Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that . "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay . Okay . "
B,Task,"Maybe a little bit . "
B,Task,"Yeah . I don't know . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"No comm uh it's clear . "
B,Other,"So more uh birds ? "
A,Other,"N no no . "
A,Other,"We get your point . "
B,Task,"Okay comm okay comm okay . "
A,Elicit,"Okay . Who wants to be next ? "
D,Other,"Yeah comm whatever . I'll go next . "
D,Other,"Thanks . "
D,Task,"I haven't got a favourite animal too comm so "
B,Minor,"M "
B,Other,"Pictionary . "
D,Elicit,"Oh . What should I draw ? "
B,Task,"A cow . "
A,Minor,"Oh . "
D,Other,"Thank you comm "
D,Other,"I'll draw a penguin . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"Yeah . "
D,Other,"I'll draw a penguin . "
D,Other,"Whatever . "
D,Task,"I can't draw comm "
D,Other,"so you can start to laugh already . "
A,Other,"I'll do so . "
D,Other,"Whatever . "
D,Task,"Something like that . "
D,Other,"Come on . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm it's little bit hard . "
D,Other,"Mm hmm hmm comm orange . "
B,Task,"Orange comm of course . "
D,Other,"Whatever . "
D,Task,"Oh comm it's better than your bird . "
B,Task,"Uh yeah . "
D,Other,"Everything's better than your bird . "
B,Other,"Yeah . True . "
D,Other,"Whatever . "
D,Task,"Hey comm it's blue . "
D,Other,"No . Whatever . "
D,Task,"Um comm I like its ugliness "
D,Minor,"and uh Yeah comm whatever . "
D,Task,"The way it walks or whatever . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Your turn . "
C,Other,"'Kay . "
D,Other,"Drawing . "
C,Other,"I'm going to draw a cat . "
C,Task,"I don't know why comm but a cat is a very uh smart animal . "
C,Task,"And you can have them at home . "
C,Task,"Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and "
A,Task,"Well comm you can have a piranha at home . "
C,Task,"Ye yes comm yeah . "
A,Minor,"Huh . "
D,Other,"Or a line . "
B,Task,"A little bit . "
D,Other,"I mean a bird . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Other,"Don't mess with my birds comm yeah . "
C,Task,"It's not very uh very good drawn comm but you can see a cat from it . "
D,Other,"Hmm . It's a handicapped cat . "
B,Other,"cat . "
A,Other,"I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that . "
C,Minor,"It's "
C,Task,"Ah comm it's not scared . He's crying but "
A,Minor,". "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Other,"He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness . "
A,Elicit,"What do you like about it then ? "
C,Task,"Uh it's i most cats are small . "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
C,Task,"You can handle them . "
A,Task,"Okay . Okay . Okay comm "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"and then we are uh through the tool training comm I guess . "
D,Task,"I wouldn't call it training comm but "
A,Task,"Okay comm this is uh something about the project finance . "
A,Task,"The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . "
A,Task,"And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . "
A,Task,"We're very ambitious on this one . "
A,Task,"The market range is international comm so it's gonna be sold world-wide comm "
A,Task,"and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . "
A,Task,"So that's clear . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah ? "
B,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"Okay comm we're now gonna discuss some stuff when "
A,Task,"well comm we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . "
A,Elicit,"Uh comm well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . "
A,Elicit,"Do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls ? "
A,Elicit,"Or do they annoy you sometimes ? "
C,Task,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"Are they difficult to understand comm or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ? "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
D,Task,"I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls comm "
D,Task,"but if you see elderly people comm all these buttons comm and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . "
A,Minor,"Yeah comm okay . "
B,Minor,"Different . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places comm and half of the functions a are removed comm or whatever . "
D,Task,"Uh comm so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with "
D,Task,"uh grouped buttons comm you know . "
D,Task,"All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh "
A,Minor,"Different functions of of uh "
D,Task,"Well comm one area or whatever comm "
D,Task,"not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um comm yeah comm to minimise it to this this or whatever o o other functions totally somewhere else . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I think we should group them . "
A,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"And uh comm is it gonna be a remote control that's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment comm like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? "
D,Task,"Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder comm and not with a stereo comm I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players comm recorders . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Minor,"Uh "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"But uh comm the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"It's what comm from my experience . "
B,Minor,"But isn't it "
D,Task,"I don't know . "
D,Task,"Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"But we gonna "
B,Task,"It's only for television comm I thought . Not "
D,Task,"Yes . "
A,Elicit,"Oh comm it is only for televis "
B,Task,"I thought it was only for television . "
B,Task,"So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ . "
D,Task,"Yes comm it is only for television comm but uh "
A,Minor,"So wha what "
D,Minor,"Well "
A,Elicit,"What wha what uh what document "
D,Task,"well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . "
D,Task,"If we think it's useful comm we do it . "
A,Elicit,"But comm where where did it uh Where did you find that ? "
B,Task,"Uh comm in the email . "
A,Task,"Oh comm okay . "
D,Task,"That's right . It's a television remote control . "
B,Minor,"I thought it said uh "
D,Task,"But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_ "
B,Task,"Yeah comm television remote control . "
C,Minor,"Yes comm "
A,Task,"Yeah comm but most television remote controls support other functions as well . "
C,Task,"Yes comm that's uh something extras . "
A,Minor,"So we can "
A,Task,"No comm we have to think about that . "
B,Task,"True . Yeah . "
B,Task,"True . "
A,Task,"Okay comm uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness comm is a is a pri priority in this case comm or "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm also no one's gonna buy it . "
C,Task,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Yeah comm yeah . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
B,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"I guess . "
C,Task,"Only the experts . "
B,Minor,"True . "
A,Task,"Well comm this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh comm or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"That w Well comm then you're you're the usability uh man comm so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then . "
B,Other,"Oh my God . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
B,Task,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Elicit,"Well comm other ideas ? "
A,Elicit,"How can we make it trendy or something ? "
A,Elicit,"Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ? "
C,Task,"Uh comm to go with to go with fashion and "
A,Task,"Maybe a can opener underneath it ? "
A,Task,"I don't know . "
B,Other,"For the bear . Uh "
A,Task,"Or someth something special comm like uh M_P_ three player inside of it comm or uh "
B,Minor,"I I uh comm no I think it "
A,Task,"Oh comm well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably . "
D,Task,"Yeah comm way too high . "
B,Task,"Uh comm I th I think yo we have to keep it simple comm to get a whole market . "
D,Minor,"Yep . "
B,Task,"It's international comm so we have to use a standard . "
A,Task,"Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh "
A,Task,"Well comm m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it "
D,Task,"Well that's an idea of course comm yeah . "
A,Task,"We gonna skip back to the goals probably . Uh comm "
D,Minor,"Mm-hmm . "
A,Task,"original comm trendly comm and user-friendly "
A,Task,"Well comm we al also already talked about user-friendliness . "
B,Minor,"Hmm . "
A,Task,"No comm well something trendy and original comm "
A,Task,"well that that goes hand in hand I guess . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"When something is original comm it tends to be trendy comm probably comm "
A,Task,"or we should make it combination of that . "
A,Minor,"'Kay comm so you "
A,Task,"the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for comm "
A,Task,"so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh comm you know comm you want to manage with it . "
A,Task,"Well comm and that's an important part for you then comm with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it . "
B,Task,"Use friendly . "
B,Task,"Yep . "
A,Task,"Well comm and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . "
A,Task,"Well comm you know comm y like some special feature . "
A,Task,"Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something . "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yes comm what the market wishes . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Well comm the closing . "
A,Task,"Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . "
A,Task,"Individual comm I think so . "
A,Task,"The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design comm of course comm "
A,Minor,"we will uh "
A,Task,"Already s said that . "
A,Minor,"The User Interface Designer "
A,Elicit,"is it a User Inter User Interface "
B,Task,"Yeah . Yeah comm yeah . Interface d "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"the technical functions design . "
A,Task,"And the Management Expert of uh the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi "
A,Task,"Well comm this one was already clear to us . "
A,Task,"Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . "
A,Task,"I don't know how much time we have left . "
A,Task,"Oh comm not many I guess . "
A,Task,"We started at twelve . "
D,Task,"You just got a message . "
A,Elicit,"Oh comm and what does it said ? "
D,Task,"And it said uh five minutes comm so we got four and a half . "
B,Minor,"Oh comm I don't "
A,Minor,"W "
A,Minor,"Okay comm well um "
B,Task,"I didn't get a message . "
D,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"He's the whatever . "
B,Task,"Oh comm the Project Manager . "
C,Task,"Team Leader . "
A,Task,"No comm we're uh ahead of schedule then . "
D,Task,"Team Leader . "
D,Other,"He is the whatever . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm close it . "
A,Other,"I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Task,"And uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations . "
D,Minor,"Yes . "
B,Minor,"Okay . "
A,Minor,"You can all Or we're all uh "
D,Elicit,"Project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white-board . "
A,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"Yeah comm but we're all familiar with uh uh Microsoft PowerPoint comm are we ? "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
D,Task,"Yes . "
B,Task,"Yeah . "
A,Task,"Yeah comm okay . "
A,Other,"I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down "
D,Task,"Alright . "
A,Task,"and then we're ready . "
D,Task,"Okay . "
A,Task,"Or we can leave already I guess . "
A,Minor,"or uh or sh or should we uh "
D,Minor,"Yeah . "
A,Elicit,"or is important that we leave at exact uh "
C,Task,"No . "
D,Task,"No . "
A,Task,"Okay . "
D,Task,"I don't think so . "
B,Task,"I don't think Oh "
D,Elicit,"Yes ? "
A,Task,"Yes . "
D,Task,"Great . "
C,Other,"Oh . "
A,Task,"We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes . "
D,Task,"Yeah . "
