ironically  one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life .  unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest  because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes  watching this sad excuse for a movie .  actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldnt be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie .  not only is it a pathetically bad film overall  but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever .  the plot is scattered  thin and predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video .  it is december 31  1981 and the big party is at monicas ( martha plimpton ) house .  but no one has arrived yet .  her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups .  some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica  and some are total strangers .  but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before nights end .  those who are invited are the ones that have the issues .  it is up to those who arent to help them come to terms .  first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monicas and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance  or lack thereof .  he is one of the most bland characters  in a film full of dullness  because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical  a common trait of this poor production .  bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new years eve and tag along to the party with them .  they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections .  he is nether sexually deprived  nor uncertain about his future  as he is in law school .  his lack of flaws is both boring  unrealistic and painful to watch .  as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy .  moving on  there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie  ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts .  val is monicas cousin and a true fan of the new york scene .  on the other hand  stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just cant find .  paradoxically  it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence  but arent successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds .  of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples  only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot .  wisely  the movies creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless .  paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship .  however  the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends  and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening .  finally  there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film .  jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindys virginity the night before .  while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self  he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy .  very often  when a film is as putrid as this production  there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory .  however  this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted .  instead  what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts  bad continuity and inaccuracies .  first  and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another  there is no apparent order that it follows  and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot .  at other times  objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot .  there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish .  not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver .  and yet  no matter how miserable this film may be  and no matter how poor the acting is all around  there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots .  perhaps  if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or  perhaps  even three  there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development  or quality acting  or even a decent plot payoff at the end .  but it didnt happen that way .  the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance  and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight . 
1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject  or  to be precise  same  high concept  .  in summer 1994  that  high concept  was  mad bomber action thriller  .  in few weeks   thrillride of the summer  actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away  so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes .  the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland  where gaerity ( tommy lee jones )  ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material  escapes from prison .  he comes to boston  where he accidentally notices jimmy dove ( jeff bridges )  dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police .  few people except gaerity know the doves violent past  when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence  betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose .  gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror  directed specifically at doves colleagues  friends and relatives .  dove  who is just going to retire and start family  now must confront the mad bomber .  while speed doesnt even try to bother with plot and characters  using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes  blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story .  and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed .  badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all .  screenplay by john bateer and john rice  barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland  using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama .  the plot is  of course  full of implausibilities .  the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual  no matter how brilliant he is  can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay .  those questions  same as in the case of speed  could be forgotten while the action goes on  but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters .  because of them  movie seems a little bit too long  and boring at times .  the most annoying element of the film  however  is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber .  his acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself .  this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive .  the film have few bright points  though .  some of the action scenes are fine  which should be credited to director stephen hopkins ( predator ii  judgement night ) .  and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of doves colleague .  but  all in all  blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous  yet hardly unforgettable competitor . 
dont get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate bessons naive  unashamedly romantic worldview  an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood .  his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving  thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman  and 1997s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love  l-u-v  thats even more of a hoot on repeated viewings .  but his joan of arc is a mess  despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close-cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself .  jovovich  bessons own personal muse through the making of his last two films ( though theyve since separated )  is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan ( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior  but also a fabulous  supermodel-level babe ) .  and besson remains a servicable action film director  though not an especially facile one .  leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english  joans struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring  and besson helps you understand how the french could believe  fervently  that god is on her side .  bessons big mistake  i think  is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject .  yes  joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue-eyed christ figure on display in bessons hallucinatory dream sequences .  the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman ( billed as  the conscience  ) shows up  spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell  babbling like ally mcbeal .  thats kind of a shame  since she does quite well up to that point  charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness .  that darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that shes as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels  in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing shes overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady whos about to take a fall .  as the story winds down  with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire  besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance .  trouble is  hes chosen a lurid  often jokey tone for the balance of the picture -- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes -- and its impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is  to a great extent  nothing more than a put-on .  this glib  pre-fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyers the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 )  a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joans trial  and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema .  compared to that film  the messenger plays as a crime against history .  -------------------------------------------------------------- directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france/usa  1999  theatrical aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 -------------------------------------------------------------- 
delicatessen ( directors : marc caro/jean-pierre jeunet ; screenwriters : gilles adrien/marc caro ; cinematographer : darius khondji ; editor : herve schneid ; cast : dominique pinon ( louison )  marie-laure dougnac ( julie clapet )  jean-claude dreyfus ( clapet-the butcher )  karin viard ( mademoiselle plusse )  ticky holgado ( marcel tapioca )  anne-marie pisani ( madame tapioca )  jacques mathou ( roger )  rufus ( robert kube )  howard vernon ( frog man )  edith ker ( granny )  boban janevski ( young rascal )  mikael todde ( young rascal )  chick ortega ( postman )  silvie laguna ( aurore interligator )  howard vernon ( frog man ) ; runtime : 96 ; miramax/constellation/ugc/hatchette premiere ; 1991-france )  reviewed by dennis schwartz  a black comedy set in the near future in a boarding house run by a depraved butcher .  the comedy is played more in comic strip style for entertaining value than for deeper satire  as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags and relies heavily on special effects .  the world has fallen on hard times and there are food shortages which include no meat  so the butcher serves up meat from human flesh to customers who pay with grain  almost as valued a commodity .  thats the big joke in the film and the novelty of that cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast  as the characters are too absurd and sketched too thinly for us to care about them .  this tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy is a first feature for the co-directors marc caro/jean-pierre jeunet .  it failed to reach my funny bone and instead left me mostly annoyed at its slight story and its dark projections for the future .  an ex-circus clown named louison ( dominique pinon )  the films too-good-to-be-true hero  answers an ad for work as a handyman for clapet ( jean-claude dreyfus )  and the butcher and landlord  offers him room and board in his house .  the butchers clumsy and near-sighted daughter julie ( marie-laure dougnac ) falls in love with the skinny  weird looking clown  and the two make some music together  with her playing the cello and him a saw .  they are the innocents  surrounded by a boarding house of misfits suffering from fear and watched over by her overbearing father  who has lured into his tenement the clown  as he has his past innocent victims  so that he can put his cleaver to him and then sell him as meat  which he intends to do as soon as the clown fixes up the tenement .  the entire film takes place in the shabby tenement  and the tenants are an odd lot of bizarre malcontents  who do not trust each other .  there are two youngsters ( boban janevski & mikael todde ) who do any kind of mischief they can .  a frog man ( howard vernon ) who lives with water on the floor so he can raise his frogs and snails that he eats .  two brothers ( mathou & kube ) who create little cow-moo novelty toys .  a man ( holgado ) who sells a bullshit detector to the butcher for his piece of meat .  a slutty woman ( karin viard )  who lives with the butcher and only wants his meat .  the aristocratic woman ( silvie laguna ) who tries numerous times to commit suicide but is too inept to do it right .  the tenants are too afraid to come out at night because they know what the butcher is up to  so they are forced to communicate with each other through a pipe that runs through the building ( in one scene they are all in musical harmony to the lovemaking of the butcher and his gal  as their bedsprings squeak ) .  there is also a sex-crazed postman ( chick ortega )  who lusts for the butchers daughter and carries a gun while delivering the mail .  there is also an underdeveloped subplot about a band of incompetent underground veggie fanatics  called trogolodistes  who have been summoned to rescue the clown and steal some grain .  the directors overloaded the film with too many eccentrics  as the comedy seemed forced while the surreal look of the film added no dramatic intensity .  delicatessen could have some appeal to the cult film crowd who like their meat sliced thin  monty python fans  and those who liked terry gilliams brazil  a film similar in spirit . 
its a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise .  the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying .  osmosis jones is crude  gross  disgusting  and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind theres something about mary  me  myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt .  not that theres anything wrong with scatology .  i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was .  its merely that with osmosis jones  the farrellys humor is too juvenile  too predictable .  you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn .  osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho .  the trouble is  the animation may please the very young  but the jokes may be over their heads  while the teen-age audience may find it too tame for their tastes .  adults ? well  lets just say most will find it unappetizing .  osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby .  the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray )  who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe .  he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower .  frank  much to the consternation of his daughter  is a fast-food addict  eating anything - and everything - that can kill you .  he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does .  franks body is invaded by thrax  a lethal virus  after frank eats a hard-boiled egg that had fallen to the ground .  its not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth .  nope  the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg  wresting it from the primates mouth .  like i said  the gross meter tips the scales on this one .  after ingesting the egg  the movie begins its animated sequences .  here  osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock )  a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasiers david hyde pierce )  a 12-hour  painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) .  basically  what we have is a cliched cop-buddy movie  rife with all the clich ? s of that genre .  and this is why osmosis jones doesnt click .  it merely falls back on tired  familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations .  the jokes and puns are lame : osmosis searches out a snitch  a former flu virus .  after pumping him for information  drix tells osmosis   funny  he doesnt look fluish .   and the jokes dont rise above that level .  the live action scenes are no better .  frank is such a slob  so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child .  hes almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters .  osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left .  the animation is rather two-dimensional and flat .  it lacks scope and depth .  it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head  and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater . 
has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot-driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs ?  in enemy of the state  that is exactly right .  a few parts the net  and a few parts conspiracy theory  enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997s lame brained men in black .  will this guy ever get a real role ?  he has the bruce willis syndrome .  the plot is bascially smith  playing a lawyer  getting into hot water with some high government murderers  who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie  when a tape of the killing gets into his hands .  he inlists the help of an old conspirator ( hackman )  and  at the end  er . . . you  know .  enemy was one of the worst films of last year .  not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight  the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven  and i didnt like how smith always magically out-smarted the badies when all the other extra characters  seeming more intelligent than smith  somehow got run over by a truck .  enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek : insurrection .  i know these two films are different in  well  everything  but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me .  somehow  quality cant overshadow quantity . 
vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly dangelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family .  as with the other three films  their two children  rusty and audrey  are played by a revolving series of actors .  this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles .  also back  is cousin eddie ( randy quaid )  the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes .  in vegas vacation clark griswold ( chase ) decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen ( dangelo ) can renew their wedding vows .  it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue .  apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldnt bother to write any jokes into the script .  at least thats the way it looks when watching this turkey .  about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film  since there had been none up to that point .  by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times  and i had smiled at a couple of gags .  i might add that none of the funny ( and i use the term loosely ) moments came as a result of anything chase  dangelo or quaid were involved in .  they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film .  the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids  who manage to have a couple of their own adventures .  rusty becomes a vegas high roller  providing most of the films best moments .  every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag  it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film .  which brings me to the best moment of the film .  the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road ( the theme from the original vacation ) begins to play .  christie brinkley and her red ferrari ( also from the first movie ) drive by .  it was a cute moment  but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been  and just how far that this series has fallen .  too bad . 
burnt money is the perfect festival film .  it will show once or twice  and then no one  thankfully  will ever have to hear from it again .  this film from the seattle international film festival 2001s emerging masters series is easily one of the years worst .  billed as a gay `bonnie and clyde  this gritty film from director marcelo pi ? eyro has its only highlight in a well-designed title sequence .  two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader  whose plan they screwed up  angry .  this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys  one of whom may not actually be gay .  hiding out in a prostitutes apartment  the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movies conclusion .  if caught  they risk losing all the money  and their love .  as an added emotional bonus  one of the gay men is dying .  or something like that .  everything that happens is so quick and confusing i was completely lost .  clarity isnt exactly this movies striving virtue  so it was a little hard to pick up .  not much could have really happened though .  the main events in this long two-hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex  graphic drug use  extreme violence  and strong language .  lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when theres a reason  but theres no purpose to anything in this film .  most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly  while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing .  it appears pi ? eyro ( who co-wrote with marcelo figueras  from a novel by ricardo piglia ) purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement .  he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible  makes them snort cocaine  gives them guns and condoms  and lets them go .  burnt money is pointless .  the performances are bad .  it tries to thrill and shock  but only causes boredom .  god forbid it will ever get a distributor .  another disappointing film from this years so-called emerging masters series .  pass on by . 
claire danes  giovanni ribisi  and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists  but theyre just about the only palatable element of the mod squad  a lame-brained big-screen version of the 70s tv show .  the story has all the originality of a block of wood ( well  it would if you could decipher it )  the characters are all blank slates  and scott silvers perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come .  by sheer force of talent  the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever theyre on screen  but the mod squad is just a second-rate action picture with a first-rate cast . 
the haunting  a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us .  if youve ever seen a movie  which you probably have considering you are on this website  you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie .  they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film .  but  the one i always like are the &quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film .  for instance  the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film  small soldiers .  they had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ?  well  after seeing the haunting  i had a few particular names for it as well .  unfortunately  i can only post one of them  otherwise  id be getting some pretty angry e-mails from overprotective mothers .  that title would be the confusing .  ok  that is a pretty bad title  but it fits this film perfectly .  it basically serves up no purpose  and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot  it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb .  liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth  but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth .  the haunting is nothing but trash  but unfortunately  will still make a boatload of money .  before i rant and rave about how bad this film is  let me point out the few  and i stress the word few  bright spots in this film .  first  the house is great- looking .  it looks beautiful  but this is also a dark spot .  it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it .  this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film .  things look so great  that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight .  haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie .  the hill house is not eerie .  it is beautiful  but not the least bit frightening .  ever heard of lili taylor ?  before this film i did not  but i am glad that i do now .  she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film .  despite the dry dialogue and boring/confusing concept  she manages to light up the screen every time she appears  but unfortunately  her co-stars are usually following right behind .  owen wilson  who plays luke  is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance  other then taylor .  he is basically there for the comic relief  and his character development is poor in all other areas .  all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped .  wilson had potential as luke  but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs .  liam neeson and catherine zeta-jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film .  their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot .  they just are not believable and this is the final nail in the hauntings coffin .  the plot is terrible .  the opening scene of the film is very important  but the director makes it too obvious by getting close-ups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film .  as i sat through the film  i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish .  nell  lili taylors character  goes from the hunted to the savior .  it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film .  he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in-depth information .  for instance  the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program .  but  we get zilch for the other four .  plus  two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes .  and the worst part : most horror films have killings .  for some reason  they kill off luke at the end of the film .  no reason whatsoever  just off with his head  literally .  overall  the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie .  bad plot  confusing storyline and a waste of good talent .  hopefully  liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential .  hopefully  lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film .  and hopefully  other horror films  such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house  will not be as bad as this one . 
in 1989  director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama   glory   but since then  he has made continuous disappointments  to me at least  with 1994s  legends of the fall   and 1996s  courage under fire .   those two films werent bad  just not very good  but with zwicks latest film   the siege   he has finally made one .    the siege   is a modern-day action-thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city .  investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) and frank haddad ( tony shalhoub )  who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it .  later  a bomb goes off in a broadway theater  killing even more .  they soon meet cia operative elise kraft ( annette bening )  who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist .  there are some movies that simply dont need to be made  and   the siege  may very well be one of them .  oh  sure  zwick thinks he is making a  meaningful  action film  since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism  but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than  say   die hard   which also starred bruce willis .  this time  willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u . s . army  who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax .  whatever points   the siege   earnestly tried to make  were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen  or maybe  zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place .  the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical  just as women were in the recent   john caprenters vampires   by placing them all in the category of  bad guys .     the siege   contains three fine actors---washington  bening  and shalhoub---but washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development .  bening has slightly more to do  and has an intriguing character to work with  while shalhoub pretty much steals the show  even though  again  he has no real character .  by the climax of   the siege   with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so-called  message  of the story  i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to   on deadly ground   in which steven seagal gave a 10-minute speech at the end about preserving the environment .    the siege  is constantly heavy-handed  not entertaining or insightful  and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay . 
i guess that if a very wild bachelor party had gone really bad  there would be broken furniture  traces of smack and cocaine on the floor  and a dead prostitute in the bathroom .  i guess that if a movie had also gone really bad  there might be the same elements present .  coincidence ?  poor kyle ( a meek looking jon favreau ) . . . he is about to marry his radiant fiancee  laura ( cameron diaz ) .  but before he exchanges his vows  he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout .  but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get .  the prostitute has met a horrible  though accidental death  and drugs are everywhere .  the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time .  a surprisingly calm robert boyd ( christian slater )  who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions  ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where shell never be found .  although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body ( which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases )  when they return from their trip  guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends .  one is adam ( daniel stern ) he grows increasingly agitated .  whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way  his blood pressure increases .  or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family .  another is michael  who was actually responsible for her death .  he tries to bury his feelings  but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well .  boyd is the ? doer of the group .  seemingly suffering from a long psychosis  when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed  he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks .  kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to lauras demanding expectations .  then  theres moore ( leland orser ) who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face .  the problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a cruel comedy  but it presents things in a manner that just arent funny .  drugs  mutilation  and killing your own friends isnt something to be laughed at .  as a straight psychological drama  i could see how it might have worked  as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimes-sick ways .  but this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for 2 hours .  if you do like this movie  i dont think that i want to know you .  i did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the ? smart play .   and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a wedding-needing fiancee .  but her talents are essentially wasted here .  its obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone .  but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless .  do not make a very bad decision by seeing this film . 
i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year  when matthew perry had just signed on .  im big fan of perrys subtle sense of humor  and in addition  i think chris farleys on-edge  extreme acting was a riot .  so naturally  when the trailer for  almost heroes  hit theaters  i almost jumped up and down .  a soda in hand  the lights dimming  i was ready to be blown away by farleys final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perrys big breakthrough .  i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farleys best  in spite of david spades absence .  i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran .  sadly  none of this came to pass .  the humor is spotty at best  with good moments and laughable one-liners few and far between .  perry and farley have no chemistry ; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade  for its his type of humor  and not at all what perry is associated with .  and the movie tries to be smart  a subject best left alone when its a farley flick .  the movie is a major dissapointment  with only a few scenes worth a first look  let alone a second .  perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie  and not surprisingly ; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley .  and farleys classic humor is widespread  too .  almost heroes almost works  but misses the wagon-train by quite a longshot .  guys  lets leave the exploring to lewis and clark  huh ?  stick to  tommy boy   and well all be  friends  . 
the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride  and its sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics  both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the years finest films .  so  naturally  when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found  this notion left me puzzled .  it is a rare thing for a childrens movie to be praised this highly  so wouldnt you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly  magical  piece of work ?  a tad bewildered  but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films  i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind  having great expectations for the film .  looking back  i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater .  believe me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city .  the plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original  babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon .  but after a fateful encounter with a water well  arthur hogget ( james cromwell  who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially .  the only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski  going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public ) .  problem is  the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded  city   a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion .  setting the main plot in motion  mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals  despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels .  it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters  the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright .  here is where the film took a wrong turn .  up until this point  i had being having a rather enjoyable experience .  the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accused of smuggling drugs .  unfortunately  the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel  none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe .  the main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children  and i believe it is .  at one point  a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown .  at other times  we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs . hoggets full cavity search at the airport .  in fact  the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing .  however  that is  as they say  neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway .  the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half  let alone entertain a child .  another problem i found with the film was its sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story .  if youre going to make a darker and more sinister sequel  fine .  it may not be my cup of tea  but at least it is a noble ambition .  but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs . hogget swinging from wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ?  it just didnt feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining  and the same goes for the rest of the movie . 
to put it bluntly  ed wood would have been proud of this .  a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor  hokey drama  zero logic and a crap screenplay .  also  a beautifully anti-climactic ending .  not to say it didnt look intriguing when i saw the previews .  so much for truth in advertising .  roland emmerich  whos later  independence day  would look like  the 400 blows  compared to this  co-writed and directed this inane sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens .  in a useless opening sequence  men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it .  it wouldnt be till present day ( 94 ) till they would actually figure it out .  theyre decipherer ?  a slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist )  dr . dan jackson ( james spader  doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) whos life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word .  why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ?  so there is a hokey ending !  duh !  he figures it out in about a minute .  yea .  and then they get a suicidal colonel or something   jack  oneill ( kurt russel  with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) .  why a suicidal colonel ?  for the ending !  youll get the hang of this .  they open the stargate  a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad .  after an overdone special effects thing  theyre . . . inside a goddam pyramid .  so they went to egypt  right ?  wrong .  theyre on another planet that was filmed in egypt .  they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra  the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson  with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma )  and there are fights  explosions and a kiss between two people .  yea .  also melodrama  stupidity  hokey scenes and a bizarre language .  an anti-climactic ending ends with stupid lines (  say hello to king tut  asswhole !   - the quintessential line  lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-character development .  by the end  you just wanna go home and watch  i dont know  the  outer limits  or something .  the scripts terrible .  the special effects are okay  but nothing great .  the storys so weak that its almost opaque .  the whole experience just isnt worth it unless youre so bored that youd consider watching a  full house  marathon . . . or  this .  id pick this  obviously  but still  its just not fun at all .  and i cant wait for it to premier on mst3k . 
i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick .  take the professional  for example .  it boasts extremely glossy cinematography  a couple of recognizable name actors  and a couple of fairly impressive explosions .  its also basically about violence and cheap titilation  and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension .  the professional is all over the map  and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant .  the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno )  brutally efficient but also very isolated .  one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door .  her name is matilda ( natalie portman )  and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a .  agent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matildas father tried to rip him off .  leon reluctantly takes matilda in  then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother .  the two become closer  which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much  and sets out to eliminate them both .  writer/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita  a slick potboiler about a female assassin .  there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast  he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting .  but beneath the shiny wrapper  there isnt nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe .  the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop .  leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits  all intended to show us that for a hired killer  hes really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk  takes meticulous care of a potted plant  and enjoys gene kelly movies .  jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality  but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda .  natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality  but she doesnt have too much to work with  either .  besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life  and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing .  a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place  as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag .  gary oldmans entire part is something of a cheap gag  wild-eyed and way over the top  but at least he is interesting to watch .  there isnt a real person to be found anywhere in the professional  which isnt always a problem in an action thriller  except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more .  a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way .  there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matildas relationship : confront it head on  or ignore it entirely .  but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that hes going to show them a forbidden love story  while choosing simply to focus his camera on portmans rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing .  this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol  or the blood which is spilled aplenty .  a great deal of the time  the professional is just plain sleazy  and all the soft filters in the world cant disguise that fact . 
one of these days  ill make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie .  king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single  emotive viewing )  his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house trappings .  its a perfume-drenched  coke-addled visit to the seedy pornography shop  where beautiful models ( no  hookers -- no  courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains .  ferraras only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again  since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever hes onscreen .  his 8-minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal  unwatchable  and pretentious failure .  when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements  or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch  theres a much-needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair .  you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know theyre actually having fun ?  the addiction is that movie .  walken  sadly  does not appear in the blackout .  the central role of matty  a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction  is played by matthew modine ( who takes what he can get after cutthroat island ) .  much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonionis terminally bored cultural elite  matty is involved in a bitter pill  relationship  with high fashioned model annie ( at least i think shes a model . )  mattys lady is played by french actress b ? atrice dalle  arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that  but it lends credence to the idea that ferraras entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout .  no kidding .  requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferraras movies and his controversial urban lifestyle .  matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him .  no doubt  he was off chasing the dragon .  in his despair  matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery  tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper  in full  dirty ol man  mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs .  wider ! )  toward the end of the night  they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez )  start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene  then matty thankfully blacks out .  something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie  and its exactly what you think it was .  suffice to say  theres some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two  or anyone at all .  the blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of  plenty of raunch  and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in his hotel room by the sea  by the sea  by the beautiful sea .  cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu-style sleaze ( and were back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits .    yeah ! ! !  yeah ! ! !  arrrghhh !   says mr . hopper .  dirty old sod . )  its compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way  leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny .  hows that for cryptic ?  never fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what hes all about .  i can picture it now .    take off yer clothes  kid -- its essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist  and youre his visual id .  youre the soul  the heart  the bloodstream of the picture .  take it off !  take it all off ! ! !  ha ha ha !   friggin vampire .  yeah  you  ferrara .  a final word about matthew modine : hes actually a fine actor when properly cast  but theres something too squeaky-clean in his demeanor .  hes ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations  such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time-bomb nebbish in short cuts ( who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene  though no one seems to notice him ) .  [he was in that scene ?  -ed . ]  here  hes asked to let it all hang out  sporting a three-day stubble and oily bangs .  he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski  but its somehow lacking .  modine lacks the feral intensity of brando  entirely miscast in ferraras flesh fair .  better luck next time  matt .  someday  youll be forgiven for cutthroat island  which wasnt really your fault in the first place .  maybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere  and all will once again be well in your world . 
making your first feature film aint easy .  assemble a decent  if not  strong cast  as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eyed king  and youre already ahead of the game .  but rehash old plot lines  tired dialogue  and standard clich ? s  and a well-intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film .  how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ?  the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another  but here we have it .  again .  five irish kids in nycs hells kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop .  with teary music .  and slow motion .  in the films first scene .  the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults  unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen .  leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good-hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante .  id like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah  blah  blah  but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points .  hes concerned about buddy jason gedricks heroin abuse .  he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwins characters sister .  he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic-looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch ) .  but none of this ever really amounts to anything .  it seems that morescos greater concern is to provide that intangible  slice of life   that flavor of the neighborhood that everyones been trying to evoke since scorseses early work .  so  we get the drunk guys  hugging and singing together at the local bar  to prove to us that they really love each other .   ( do people actually do this ! ? )  we get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word  whether it sounds like it fits or not .  we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose .  bruno kirby  chazz palminteri  you know  guys youve seen in movies just like this one before .  assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears  and baldwins performance is adequate  but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that its almost funny .  moresco  a theater guy and sometimes tv writer ( including the series falcone )  obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child  but the content is probably too personal .  as a result  the movies style is heavy-handed  in need of a considerable amount of toning down .  nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids  moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us .  with slow dissolves to the earlier scene  running in slow motion  complete with dialogue from the present  just in case we dont comprehend the link to the past .  moresco needs to either trust his audiences intelligence  or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it .  his next project should have a little more personal distance  and a lot more subtlety .  if he actually gets that chance .  reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage ( feature story coming soon ) . 
whenever u . s . government starts meddling into other countries affairs  under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political  religious or ethnic persecution  the other side is ready to use mantra that says  look whos talking !  what have you done to the indians ?   however  even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes .  hollywood is just another example  with its revisionist westerns  made in early 1990s .  those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness  coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus discovery of america .  one of such examples is geronimo : an american legend  1993 western directed by walter hill  film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers .  the hero of the film is geronimo ( played by wes studi )  leader of apaches  fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century .  when the movie begins  in 1885  geronimo and his apaches made peace with u . s . government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation .  however  broken promises  injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless .  with not more 30 or so of his followers  he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign .  general crook ( gene hackman )  commander of u . s . army forces  respects geronimo and knows that even his 5  000 force isnt enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest .  instead  he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches - lt . charles gatewood ( jason patric ) and indian hunter al sieber ( robert duvall ) .  together with young lt . britton davis ( matt damon ) they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo .  geronimo : an american legend  like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness  try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities  but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors .  so  the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies .  almost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people .  although such elements of john millius screenplay do indeed have some basis in history  they harm the story of geronimo .  to be honest  walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film  but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time .  instead  they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band .  to make even worse  hill has some real problems with pacing and style  and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one - story about geronimo and story about his pursuers .  the movie should have been better if it turned to geronimos life before and after his last uprising  in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood .  the difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting .  wes studi  cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans  was perfect choice for geronimo  not only because he resembles geronimo  but because he induces a lot of passion in his role .  contrary to him  we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies .  while this could be expected from someone like jason patric  it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall .  even hills directing is bellow expectations - battle scenes are too short and  like in many of his late films  force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s .  even his old associate  music composer ry cooder  disappoints  with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic .  on the other hand  photography by lloyd ahern ii  with the use of red lenses  gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere  ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic .  all in all  compared with some of the hollywoods examples of political correctness  this film isnt so bad  but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better . 
aspiring broadway composer robert ( aaron williams ) secretly carries a torch for his best friend  struggling actor marc ( michael shawn lucas ) .  the problem is  marc only has eyes for  perfect 10s   which the geeky  insecure robert certainly is not .  meanwhile  marcs spoiled ( hetero ) female roommate  cynthia ( mara hobel )  spends her days lying about their apartment and harrassing magazine editor tina brown .  writer-director victor mignattis  very romantic comedy  ( as the ad campaign states ) is supposed to be ( pardon the pun ) a gay ol romp  but its hard to have much fun with these annoying  self-absorbed characters and their shallow personal problems : marc and cynthia have sitcom-level domestic  crises  ( such as trying to kill bugs--how hilarious ) ; robert and marc go to acting class ( how riveting ) ; the zaftig cynthia goes on eating binges ( how original ) .  but more than anything else  the three whine .  constantly .  marc whines about his turbulent romance with an apparent  10   david ( hugh panaro )  the hunky musician from across the way ; robert whines about not being able to find the right guy ; cynthia whines about having to find a job ( horrors ) .  the terrible trio whine their way to a happy ending that is wholly undeserved .  add in overly broad performances and some laughable lipsynching by panaro  and youre left with one astonishing piece of cinematic damage . 
  easely one of the worst films of the year . .   with the millenium just around the corner  hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century .  this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil .  the result is somewhat predictable .  i didnt have high hopes about arnolds  much anticipated  return to the big screen .  schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased  action lovers wont be bored  and the catholic league will be angry .  everyone else will see end of days for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture .  think of it as hollywoods own y2k bug .  did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 youll get 999  as in 1999 ?  yes  you better believe it . . satan is here on earth  working on his latest project -- the end of days .  this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and  although not al pacino  he is fun to behold .  he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker  wreaking  as they say  havoc .  the way it works is he smirks and something explodes .  before the stroke of the new millennium hes got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations .  only schwarzeneggers cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him .  films like this has one serious weakness -- logic .  no matter how you twist the  plot   youll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! ) .  the incredible fact is that such directors never learn .  after thousands of headless productions  this theme has become one big clich ? .  here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution .  he is walking around n . y .  blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius .  all he wants is the girl  that is somehow special .  but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks  he has hidden her in a church  where satan dare not enter .  so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information :  you can have your wife and daughter back . . i  can give you happiness that you can only dream of . . just  give me the address . .   indeed with a script like that  you could make a wonderful parody  but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously  attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller .  and for you who have awaited arnold swartzeneggers comeback  will not be very satisfied .  weve not seen him in a while .  thats because he didnt have a worthy opponent .  he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars .  he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop .  so  after all those fights  whats left for arnold schwarzenegger ?  how about satan ?  in my opinion  he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in camerons  terminator  .  and that is schwartzeneggers strength -- muscles and no emotions .  here he tries to achieve an artistic level  moving towards the oscar .  this is called  an adult turn  if successful and  a flop  if unsuccessful .  make a wild guess !  his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems .  this requires at least some acting skills .  regrettably  the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles .  the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters .  the movie is otherwise technically impressive  with a solid cinematography and fine lighting .  but the movie doesnt serve neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) .  the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry .  the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular .  so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody .  unless you are a die-hard schwartzenegger fan  stay away .  as for schwarzenegger  hell be back . 
these days  people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run .  1970s nostalgia is already wearing off  and now  people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s .  few years in the future  early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia .  however  i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period .  one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoons loaded weapon 1  that  in many ways  symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas .  being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series  this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez )  burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge  and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson )  by-the-book policeman  days away from retirement .  two of them  following the murder of lugers ex- partner  must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner )  crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies .  the authors of this films ( whose director  gene quintano  worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects  and that reflects in the lack plot  characters  and  even original lines .  the plot  or what goes for the plot in this movie  is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series  this film  borrows  its female lead from basic instinct ) .  the best gags  are  same as with many other similar movies  shown in the trailers .  the rest simply doesnt work .  only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh .  others would probably wince at the lameness of humour .  some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while .  but  at the end  spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort .  the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones .  the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel . 
paul verhoeven  the dutch auteur who dragged his violent  sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film  has never been what id consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films  notably starship troopers  have been lauded as artistic achievements )  but he is the kind of hollywood film maker whos managed to  no matter what the budget  make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils .  starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film thats nearly impossible to find on video  yet showgirls is everywhere )  in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone )  in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage .  its not a completely successful film  but as a failure its certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one .  my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters  a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( havent yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) .  i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop  a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero thats as touching as schwarzeneggers in t2 .  that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics .  its violence seemed to be there for a purpose  namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread  not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience .  theres a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him .  he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victims every fearful tic .  its a startling moment of barbaric  maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir .  in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just wont shut up  he impales a co-worker  drowns another and so on .  but why ?  his character is introduced as a smug genius  the kind whos always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear  sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place  though once the character becomes invisible  this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster .  the kind who just wont die .  hollow mans protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue  acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover  a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin whos saddled with the films worst lines (  ive lost cohesion again !  ) .  theyre a typical aaron spelling couple  good-looking but as vacant as george w . bushs republican national convention speech ( i . e .  bush referring to clinton ;  ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ?  to what end ?  --  this actually got applause !  suddenly warren beatty doesnt look so absurd ) .  the rest of the films characters are all well past thirty  though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywoods new character developing technique ?  ahh  what a cynical time we live in ? ? ?  as the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon )  an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentations ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at ) .  theyve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine  in a twist worthy of the films 1950s late show origins  to impulsively experiment on himself .  caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead .  our mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications )  then he inexplicably ( its hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures  but this is never explored  and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? )  begins raping  assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases  always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger .  it grows abundantly clear with each new release that its verhoevens films that have become hollow .  like the rest  this one is cold  heartless  and full of contempt for humanity  but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit  insight and makes no statement other than  audiences will pay for anything these days  .  its an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level  or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun  thrill-a-minute ride .  verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care .  the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick .  how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ?  a couple weeks ago  after seeing the trailer  a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability .  hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa  in a serious manner to boot .  but oh yeah  it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway .  verhoeven delivers the sleazy  goods   but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner  here it just feels icky and uncomfortable .  the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses  caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background .  its plainly obvious that verhoeven isnt exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well .  its funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a womans naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand .  most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks .  in fact its largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since  by the end  most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat .  as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre )  and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked .  the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy .  it happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens  who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon  suddenly pauses .    are you looking at me ?   she queries  obviously haunted .  its a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 ( the apex of the mad slasher craze ) .  those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer .  and theyre the only reason to check out hollow man  preferably as a mid-week bargain rental .  youve been warned .  but you probably wont listen  will you ?  tis a pity ? ? ? 
fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade .  tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies  but the quantity .  most of those movies were produced by cannon group  company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus .  those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman  b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends .  unfortunately  that didnt happened  and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade  behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage  that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal .  sadly for bronson  that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead  and lowering his own reputation in process .  on the other hand  bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular  especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself .  one of such movies that seriously marred bronsons reputation is death wish 3  third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 .  in the original movie  bronson played paul kersey  mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence .  that movie was far from masterpiece ; yet  in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry ) .  unfortunately  six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didnt stop the rapid decline of the quality .  death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend  living in the urban wasteland of east new york  populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out .  before the reunion  kerseys friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( played by gavan oherlihy  probably the only noteworthy role in the film ) .  kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade  while the police inspector shriker ( ed lauter )  ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime .  bronson  the main asset in this movie  plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine .  although bronsons charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower )  the lack of emotions or bronsons own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film .  the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness  so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kerseys crusade .  on the other hand  emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding  yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks  and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey .  unfortunately  michael winner doesnt know how to work out the plot  and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations  ends this movie with a bang .  the big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie  because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget .  in short  this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia .   ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis  the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife ) . 
overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name ( based on shirley jacksons novel  the haunting of hill house  ) stars lili taylor as one of three  lab rats  that participate in a supposed  insomnia  study being initiated by liam neeson .  he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it .  he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of  creepy  cgi effects scare the cast and try the audiences patience .  i know this question has been posed before  but why do people keep remaking good movies ?  the original was a great psychological horror film .  this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary .  in fact  i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg-13 horror movie that is scary .  unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening  then theres nothing in this film that will raise hackles .  i nearly fell asleep twice during the film  and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didnt seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed .  its sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly .  owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house  and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability .  catherine zeta-jones ( always nice to look at ) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi-sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs .  liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about whats going on as the rest of them do .  finally  poor lili taylor  the center of the film  gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her .  apparently  a subplot involving a tryst between zeta-jones and taylors characters was filmed but removed .  thats too bad  because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative .  this is jan de bonts second straight misfire ( speed 2 : cruise control being the first ) .  when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better ?  robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that .  one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset .  if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything  it would have served to make the film terrifying .  what our mind fashions on its own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything .  apparently  yet another version of this story is being filmed under its original title .  i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bonts version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had .

  tarzan and the lost city  is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while .  not only it is poorly written  badly acted  and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas  it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid .  unfortunately  its not bad in the way great  colossal misfires like  heavens gate  ( 1980 ) or  ishtar  ( 1987 ) were bad .  instead  it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with  which begs the question of why it was made in the first place .  with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced  how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ?  of course  tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films  which have ranged from the very good ( 1984s  greystoke : the legend of tarzan  lord of the apes  ) down to the really bad ( 1981s  tarzan  the ape man  with bo derek ) .  most of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties  starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps .  therefore  if another tarzan movie is to be made  one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle  an original storyline  anything to set it apart from all the others .    greystoke  added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale  and even  tarzan  the ape man  at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo dereks bare breasts .    tarzan and the lost city   on the other hand  has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue .  the script  by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come .  comic books have better plots than this .  the movie is so bad  in fact  that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summers comedy  george of the jungle .   didnt the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ?  the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes  and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage .  when the movie starts in 1913  he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent )  and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week .  however  when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar  one of africas last great secrets  the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle .  at first  jane refuses to go  pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down  therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man .  once the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way )  it delves into a series of jungle adventures  as tarzan  jane  and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city .  most of the so-called adventures are cheesy  predictable  and unexciting  with no pace  tension  or action to speak of .  there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies  ranging from  raiders of the lost ark  ( 1981 ) to  the goonies  ( 1985 ) .  when the movie is running short on action  it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals  releasing a baby elephant from a trap  and throwing ivory tusks into the river .  the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality .  for instance  when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra  he doesnt even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do .  instead  he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival .  of course  one cant help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is .  not to ruin the ending or anything  but there is no lost city .  there is  however  a lost pyramid  which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) .  which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid  when its sitting right out in the middle of an open field ?  strictly speaking   tarzan and the lost city  isnt even bad enough to have camp quality  although casper van diens laughably stiff performance comes real close .  this movie proves what  starship troopers  only hinted at : he cannot act  but he sure looks well-groomed  even in the deepest heart of the african jungle .  van dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; hes a calvin klein model in a loin cloth .  i also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut .  waddington makes a decent villain  although hes like a charmless version of belloq from  raiders of the lost ark .  as jane  the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan .  she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two  but whenever a snake comes into the picture  she is reduced to a hysterical mess .  however  amidst all this complaining  i do have one piece of good news .    tarzan and the lost city  is so lacking in ideas both new and old  that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid .  so  we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short . 
everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here .  wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence .  billy zane is wooden as the hero .  kristy swanson is given very little to do  and does very little with it .  treat williams  looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse  is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie .  only catherine zeta jones  as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance .  she has energy and spunk  which the movie needed much more of .  oh yeah  the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you wont even care .  about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones  and some colorful scenery .  however  if youre looking for a fun family movie  go watch the underrated flipper .  this is not a good movie . 
a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title  a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided  for this confused  confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle  producer andrew macdonald  and screenwriter john hodge .  at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and  yes  ordinary--premise .  after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor )  an aspiring writer of trashy novels  is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation  he kidnaps navilles ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom .  the joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially  so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme  teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . .  and  ultimately ( didnt we see this one coming ? )   love .  so far  so mediocre .  but mediocre is better than dreadful  which this film is  thanks in no small part to the hodges contextual frame for the romance .  it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth  so the chief of heavens police  gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels  oreilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo )  to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status .  this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture .  but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands  it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand .  not that there is much of a romance to begin with .  try as diaz and mcgregor may  celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters .  celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard .  as such  it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again  they never seem to really connect with each other .  when celine and robert start to overtly act on their  feelings   it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural .  but i am not exactly sure if boyle and companys point was romance ; honestly  i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish .  boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz  but it remains just that--energy  not energy in service of a story or even acting .  the cast seems lost  especially hunter  whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling .  and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels  who are not exactly angelic--in fact  they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue .  watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell  stockpiling quirks in the name of cool .  instead  the film just gives quirky a bad name .  my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes  misspelling intended ) whimsy  which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing  beyond the sea  at a karaoke bar .  after a verse or two  the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos  and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter .  the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard  just relying on the innate charm of the leads  allowing them to build a romantic rapport .  alas  not nearly enough is built  for this moment comes to an abrupt end .  i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses  but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill .  a life less ordinary certainly delivers something  different   but by the time the film was over  i was clamoring for a life more ordinary .    i can accept failure .  everyone fails at something .  but i cant accept not trying .  it doesnt matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart .   --michael jordan 
how could a g-rated disney film based on meg cabots novel  the princess diaries  be anything but cute  harmless fun ?  easy .  take all the cute  harmless fun out of it .  and while youre at it make it borrr-ring .  thats what director garry marshall  screenwriter gina wendkos and  not to be outdone  producer whitney houston have done with the g-rated disney film  the princess diaries .   you couldnt tell it from the audience though  a braintree  mass . of growing  glowing pre-pubescent girls ( and the odd parental  popcorn perched about their persons )  who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ( ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy-duddy old me ) .  well  i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over  but that would have been too obvious .  too obvious is the least of the problems with marshalls film ( garry made a couple of other  princess  movies--  pretty woman  and  runaway bride  --but this ones way without julia roberts so maybe * thats * its problem ) .  in addition to being predictable as molasses   the princess diaries  has hardly got a laugh in it ( its a comedy )  could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long  long stretches  and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we havent even seen yet ( and probably never will except  perhaps  in the dvd edition ) .  marshall should take virtually all of the blame here  since hes been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two isnt working . . .  and hardly * any * of  the princess diaries  works (  works   alas  implies cleverness and theres none of that here either ) .  newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis  a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom ( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of ( the filmmakers go out of their way * not * to call it serbia  which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words ) and now she  mia  is next in line to rule  genovia  ( hence the headphones/tiara combo in the print ads ) .  julie andrews  with the luminous factor cranked to 11  plays mias grandmother ( aka queen clarisse renaldi )  who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating  talking  and looking like a princess department ( although mias big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan ) .  does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh ?  not really .  consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets .  also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock  an evil cheerleader  a dorky-looking best friend (  welcome to the dollhouse  s heather matarazzo )  a sensitive auto mechanic/musician  and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver  imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mias chauffeur-driven limousine at every intersection .  a non-animated g-rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts  all the good stuff  has been exorcised from the finished product .  lame  labored  and lamentable   the princess diaries  is recommended for eight-and-a-half year olds of the feminine persuasion * only * ; all others would do well to avoid it ( like potholes  the plague  and  the perfect storm  ) . 
the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie  complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence .  its not abhorrent  or even blatantly unlikable  but it doesnt make a shred of sense .  and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ?  james foley knows a lot about characters and acting  and those are the strengths of the corruptor .  but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense  and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train .  at least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role .  chow plays nick chen  a chinatown cop .  hes a good cop  as the first few scenes establish  and hes very familiar with chinatown .  thats probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) .  nick and danny begin by stepping on each others toes  but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other ones life .  what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me .  im fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons  led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) .  im also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young )  a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff .  im not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny  although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way .  theres also an interesting subplot revolving around dannys father ( brian cox )  but it doesnt have much to do with the main story .  one of the problems  as i said  is that the movie doesnt make any sense .  i dont blame this entirely on foley  because hes obviously a good director .  im more inclined to point my finger at robert puccis script  which doesnt seem to be in tune to the way normal people act .  one scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because hes angry about his new white partner .  hes shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture  and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me .   ( in addition  the film takes a bite into race-related issues  and never develops them at all . )  there are a lot of scenes like this one  and none of them are very coherent .  theres also a considerable language barrier  given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents .  the plot itself never straightens out .  im not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are  or why henry lee is associated with them  or what they do as a group .  the corruptor is an action movie  and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences .  the sequences arent bad  but theyre not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ?  on that note  how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ?  one too many  id imagine .  foleys strength is clearly in characterization  and he does a pretty good job here .  the scenes between nick and danny are very good  and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together .  chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro  and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep .  wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere  but hes still fun to watch .  i also liked the subplot involving dannys father ; brian coxs performance is powerful  and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny .  but the film ultimately fails  mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes .  a complicated plot can be successful  but the story needs to make sense when its over .  the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until  finally  theres nothing left to hold on to . 
  return to horror high   wants to be a couple different types of movies at once .  the film tells the story of a low-budget horror movie being filmed at the closed-down crippen high  a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before .  but what the cast and crew dont know is that a real killer  maybe the same one that was never apprehended  is going into action again .  on one level   return to horror high  is a slasher movie  and it is at this level that it works the best on .  watching the film  which was made in 1987  i couldnt help but take notice that the killers costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in   scream   and  scream 2 .   on another level  the film wants to be a slapstick comedy  and there are many hints of this throughout .  unfortunately  most of these jokes fall flat .  and the last thing the film wants to be is a  behind-the-scenes  look at an exploitation film being made .  the only problem is that  while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made  no cameras are shown filming it  thus making it far more confusing than it had to be .  and to top it all off  the  twist  ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever  and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time .  there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous  and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through .  if you see the film  or have seen it  youll know what i mean .  the premise of  return to horror high   is admittedly pretty crafty  and i liked the atmosphere of the school  which is where the whole thing takes place .  but director froehlich  judging from this movie  is an incompetent director  except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene .  well  come to think of it  there is only one scene that is actually scary  and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in .  but other than that two-minute distraction   return to horror high   is certainly no great shake .  note : look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film .  and strangely enough  he is the first character to get the ax . . . literally . 
the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffanys in which the audience is rooting for some sweet  vulnerable  irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness .  the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo ( played by sook-yin lee ) as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible .  alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene .  this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland .  one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa .  she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window .  next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild ( adam beach ) .  he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating .  ben gets emotionally involved with alessa .   ( as alessa so delicately puts it   we were bosom buddies  now were fuck buddies .  )  but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor .  the real problem with the film seems to be helen lees inability to decide what she wants to be saying .  she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa .  alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients .  this appears to be a high profile and well-paid job .  we are supposed to care about alessas feelings  but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father .  alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint .  this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double-zero .  i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
capsule : a science fiction allegory .  at the millennium a lethal contagious virus has hit taiwan .  officials have cut off water and other services to the center of contagion .  life there devolves and degenerates .  a man in an apartment has a hole in his floor and with it harasses his downstairs neighbor .  a slow but harrowing film to be missed if possible .    low -1 ( -4 to +4 )  - the taiwan virus is ravaging taiwan and the part of the city that is the center of the contagion has been evacuated of anyone who will go .  one apartment building still houses people .  a woman  formerly an office worker  ( yang kuei-mei ) is tormented by her upstairs neighbor ( lee kang-sheng ) who has a hole cut by a plumber in the floor and is using it as a drain .  neighbor runs a small failing grocery store .  - to make things more depressing  it is constantly raining hard .  - upstairs neighbor vomits through  pours water  etc . a small and almost entirely one-sided war starts .  allegory about callousness and selfishness .  - woman is living on a pile of rolls of toilet tissue .  - incongruous songs added to show downstairs neighbors dreams .  these are the songs of popular taiwanese singer grace chang .  - apartment is falling apart .  wallpaper is separating from walls .  plumbing is failing .  - boredom shown by long cuts in which nothing happens .  a lot of film seems to be used up .  - this story might have been done much better as a ten-minute animated film .  - stars are considered to be great dramatic actors by one reviewer .  - this film seems longer at 95 minutes most two-hour films . 
seen december 2  1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida  ny )  theater #3  by myself for free ( free pass ) .  [theater rating : * * * : good seats  sound  and picture]  there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons .  they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context  from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation .  watching  flubber  really clinched this idea for me  because its just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy .  it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality  and how important it is to actually have a story .  the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted  cartoony atmosphere .  we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams )  the typical  supposedly likable mad scientist .  within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is .  phillips memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemers disease - isnt this rather lowbrow comedy ?  he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids movie if i ever saw one ) .  we learn he has stood his up fiancee  sara ( harden )  twice at the altar simply because hes forgotten .  sara claims to love him  but says if he forgets the wedding again shell stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) .  but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve  and its no surprise the major conflicts here are related .  christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft  a scientist who not only wants to steal phillips ideas  but his woman too .  whats worse is that sara actually seems interested in him !  wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield  which is going broke  unless phillip can invent something to save the day .  one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film .  the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced  but is all but forgotten about thereafter .  its obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber  a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy  and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny .  unfortunately  the flubber  like all the special effects in this film  looks very fake and unconvincing .  flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality  and by the time it performs a song and dance routine  you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object .  most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillips absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along .  but its clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse .  all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving  flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that dont fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air .  its all presented with complete logic  and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes .  during the basketball scene  the coach for the rival team actually says   i think they might be cheating   to which the referee replies   theres no rules about jumping too high .     predictable  doesnt begin to describe the motions the film goes through  especially after the halfway point .  and its not how terribly contrived the plot is  its the way its broken down scene-by-scene  with absolutely no transition .  not only that  but all the actors here  especially williams  seem bored to tears .  id say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen  so its almost forgivable when you realize theyre talking to nothing and interacting with nothing .  its safe to say everything that could be bad about  flubber  is .  the only original element the film has is the worlds first romance between a machine and a human .  but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it  and  like the rest of the film  you wont . 
plot : a down-and-out girl moves in with some over-the-top models and falls in love with a goofy-but-loveable guy from across the street .  aaaaaaaaah !  then one day  she sees him knock a woman upside the head with a baseball bat .  ooooooooh !  she must then join together with her model-friends to find out whether or not this guy is really goofy-but-loveable  or a psycho killer .  aaaaaaaaah !  critique : completely idiotic .  okay  so maybe im being a little too nice .  this movie starts off dumb  moves into the ridiculous and eventually graduates to idiocy .  there . . . thats  more like it !  and how  you may ask ?  well  its simple really .  four of the dumbest stereotypical models in the world ( oh my god  i just found out that the actresses playing the parts are models in real life . . . yipes ! )  join monica potter ( in a role which can only be described as an obvious cry for help ) and freddie prinze jr . ( not the actor  but the character better known as freddie prinze jr . )  in a plot so stupid and far-fetched  that you have to wonder once more  how crap like this gets by the hollywood bigwigs .  this thing stinks to high-heaven .  its just plain embarrassing for everyone involved .  i even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humor somehow worked its way into this so-called romantic-comedy-action movie ?  ugh .  what a pile of dung .  hey  im actually starting to sound a little like harry knowles here  but i guess i could see where his frustration comes from time to time .  its sad really .  a movie which actually had quite a few people in my audience laughing at its idiocy  including the over-used  folks hiding in the bathroom while someone else comes in to take a crap and fart  gag .  and how about that dumb blonde model who keeps running into things .  pure hilarity !  or maybe im just too jaded  too much of a critic  not relaxed enough to enjoy this fluff-piece . . . uuuhhmmm . . . naaaaah ! !  this movie sucks the big one .  its chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into a preposterous plot .  this is the kind of movie that has one character inserting another character into a car headfirst to the floor only because . . . well   its supposed to be funny  see ?  you see  that person then has their legs swinging in the other persons face as they drive and that distracts the driver  see  and well  thats kinda funny  no ?  harumph . . . yeah   well . . . you  get the picture !  anyhoo  freddie prinze jr . . . . nuff  said .  monica potter  a bad career move  but we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit .  the rest of the model girls . . . well   thanks for being there so i had something to look at  but please apologize to the entire modeling community as a whole  for making them all out to be complete imbeciles ! !  so why the three points out of ten  you may ask ?  well  its simple really .  one point goes to the russian model girl and that cool accent ( dont ask me why  but it actually turned me on ) .  one point goes out to all of the model girls for being in the movie ( nice window decoration . . . natch ! ) .  and one last point goes out to the makers of this film  who spared us any long sorted story  and made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving the theatre after only 90 minutes of manufactured garbage  so that we could run out as fast as we can  grab the next person that we see walking down the street and warn them of the devil that is . . . freddie prinze jr . . . i  mean  head over heels .  youve been warned  good people .  ps : didja notice how i didnt even mention rear window once in my entire review ?  i didnt want to taint the memory of the classic flick by having it uttered alongside this thing  but then again  i just did mention it  but i guess it doesnt count in the ps section . . . or  does it ?  ooooh  whatever . . . i have a headache !   ( i think my brain is coming back to life )  wheres joblo coming from ?  10 things i hate about you ( 7/10 ) - coyote ugly ( 6 . 5/10 )  - down to you ( 6 . 5/10 )  - save the last dance ( 7/10 ) - shes all that ( 6 . 5/10 )  - the wedding planner ( 4/10 ) - youve got mail ( 5 . 5/10 ) 
for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or whats left of it in mainstream hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things .  as a rule  the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor .  an actor might be chosen on the up-and-up  to give him exposure ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck .  generally  though  the actor doesnt matter  and soldier  the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers  exemplifies this : the picture lacks pizazz .  the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell  otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less .  russell plays todd  a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought .  the movie lets us see this degenerate process  but by the time the real plot starts  were into todds later years .  hes about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers  ones who  instead of being trained * from * birth  are genetically selected * before * birth .  the pride of this class - caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) - will be our villain  and you know hes the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movies start .  between the two leads  less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken  and its possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction .  director paul anderson  who helmed last years icy thriller  event horizon  doesnt show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam .  todd  upon being replaced  is left to die on a garbage planet ; but in order to stretch the running time out  the villains return to the garbage planet on a  routine patrol  and set the stage for the final firefight .  events are predictable from the time that the setups are made  and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here .  the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be : todd fails to show physical superiority against caine - in fact  not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry .  its not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story  and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it .  the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit  and treat it as a parody of typical action fare  like universal soldier .  a strict interpretation  however  reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style  class  or substance ; and by next year  a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television . 
director doug ellins kissing a fool  released earlier this year  is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story .  like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it  the movie meanders along insulting the viewers intelligence in almost every frame .  the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines youve heard before .   (  im not wearing any underwear   the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster  max  in what she assumes will be a sure-fire come-on line . )  max  chicagos biggest playboy  decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam  short for samantha .  max and sam possess two irritating personalities  and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience .  max is played without any style by david schwimmer .  schwimmer  whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality  makes an unlikely lover .  his costar  mili avital as sam  is cut from the same cloth  so they can be argued to be a matched pair .  after all  people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other  ditto for similar looks  so why shouldnt the personality-challenged be attracted ?  the implausible plot has max asking his best friend  jay ( jason lee )  to hit on sam as a test .  jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him  but stop short of the actual act .  max  being promiscuous by nature  worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does .  the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work .  neither the script nor the actors make this test believable .    the 64  000 question is : how do you know youre with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life ?   jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film .  finally  there is the films attempt at physical comedy .  jays ex-girlfriend natasha ( vanessa angel ) becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else .  natasha rips jays shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa .  as she throws her hair on his bare chest  she demands he pull it .  this is supposed to be funny ?  most films have some saving grace .  some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasnt .  kissing a fool  on the other hand  has nothing to recommend it .  kissing a fool runs 1 : 45 .  it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers . 
i am continually amazed at movies like this .  that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind-boggeling  but it seems to happen a lot nowadays .    wild wild west  is a beautifully filmed  well acted  and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault .  in short  this movie is a comedy without laughs .  so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal .  the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco  but its still pretty boring .  will smith stars as jim west  an old western  r&b variation of the james bond character .  west is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline )  and theyre pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets  gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach .  talk about deeply developed characters .  at any rate  this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies  none of which are funny .  the year is 1869 .  several top scientists have been abducted  and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general  bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levine ) .  president grant sends west and gordon to investigate .  theres evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana .  west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh )  another disgruntled former confederate .  as it turns out  loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon  which he will use to conquer the united states .  id go further with the plot  but there isnt any point .  this films narrative is little more than a jumbled  unfunny mess .  i only laughed at a couple of jokes  and then only lightly .  there isnt one truly uprorously funny moment in this film  and thats pretty disasterous when you consider that its primarily a comedy .  as i said  the fault is totally that of the script .  when you consider their respective roles  will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done .  the leads couldve been played samuel l . jackson and robert de niro and the film still wouldve been awful .  no one  and i mean no one  can make a line like  bye bye  mr . knife guy !   sound good .  still  this film has a lot going for it visually .  the set design is fantastic  maybe even oscar worthy .  the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus ( who was also behind camera in martin scorseses brilliant  goodfellas  )  is absolutely stunning .  he lends the film a much needed exciting  comic bookish look .  i wont fault barry sonnenfeld either .  he does a fine job of directing the proceedings  but  like the rest of the people involved with the film  there really isnt anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw .  despite being beautifully made   wild wild west  becomes quite boring after the half-way point .  the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does .  if  wild wild west  didnt look so good  it would be almost insufferable .  as it is  its somewhat tolerable  but not very entertaining .  it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low  but there isnt anything much worse than an unfunny comedy . 
this talky  terribly-plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux  an ex-new orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder- mystery after a light-plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat .  he and his wife annie ( kelly lynch ) rescue a little salvadorian girl ( samantha lagpacan ) from the wreckage and thats when the trouble begins .  the other major players include a local drug lord ( eric roberts )  his scheming wife ( teri hatcher )  a soused stripper ( mary stuart masterson )  and a shady dea agent ( vondie curtis hall ) .  everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective thats curious but never compelling .  based on the book by james lee burke  heavens prisoners is so badly plotted that entire * scenes * seem to be missing .  early on  we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves .  nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa .  later  dave is reunited with a drug-abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation .  huh ?  the whole movie is like this  perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf .  whatever the reason  somebody should tell director phil joanou ( final analysis ) to recut this mess .  in its present form  heavens prisoners runs only two hours plus change  but it feels like four . 
spoiled rich kid kelley morse ( chris klein ) receives a new mercedes for a graduation present .  he and his buddies take it for a joyride to a small nearby town  where he proceeds to torment the locals simply because hes rich and theyre not .  he ends up provoking jasper ( josh hartnett ) into a race and as a result  the local gas station and diner are destroyed when they crash into it .  kelley is sentenced to rebuild the diner  and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his familys barn .  jaspers girlfriend sam ( leelee sobieski ) soon takes a liking to kelley however  despite the fact that 1 ) it was her familys diner that was destroyed and b ) all kelley does is sit around  sulk  and smart off to the townspeople .  but when she sees him sweaty and shirtless  thats apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper ( whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case of hat hair ) .  so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley  especially after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech ( which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people ) .  in the speech  kelley quotes a poem by robert frost  which just so happens to be sams favorite poem as well .  awwwww .  soon theyre frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town ( especially jaspers best friend ) see them together .  kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town  especially when he shows up at the town dance  drunk and steaming because sam went with jasper .  kelley runs off and decides to leave town .  sam catches up to him at the bus station and he asks her to come to boston with him .  jasper shows up and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her  and sam  without even breaking stride basically says  see ya !   and takes off to boston with kelley .  here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around  its completely worthless .  chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers  and its because of their presence that i watched this film in the first place .  however  not long into the proceedings i wanted to just reach into the film and strangle them both .  i shouldnt have such feelings towards people i like  but their characters are so infuriating that . . .  well trust me  youll feel the same way .  even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong  kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two  simply because his jerkish actions are calculated .  he intends to be a jackass each and every time he does it .  jasper on the other hand  only reacts to kelleys provocations  and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions .  but  as in life  nice guys finish last .  for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the films only sympathetic character gets completely crushed .  then  a cancer subplot comes into play ( where things get even more infuriating  if you can imagine that ) .  what  things werent depressing enough for you mr . screenwriter ?  who greenlit this project ?  who  on earth  thought this would entertain anyone ?  perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people .  but even after hes destroyed these peoples lives he continues to be a snob to them  and ruins one more for good measure .  here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment .  it contains the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions .  extras include jessica simpsons music video for  where you are   a commercial for the films soundtrack ( which by the way is the only good thing about the film )  the original theatrical trailer and five tv spots  trailers for other fox releases ( anna and the king  anywhere but here  the beach  drive me crazy  ever after  romeo + juliet  simply irresistible )  as well as that new fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that i really enjoy .  the picture and sound quality on the disc are fine . . .  nothing that will challenge anyones audio/video systems of course .  fans of this movie ( if any exist ) should enjoy the dvd release .  here on earth is not entertaining nor is it compelling .  no joy or entertainment value can be derived from any of the events of the film .  it is merely a waste of time  money and talent . 
some movies pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when theyre finally released  everyone just goes along with it .  thus sometimes  films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations .  last year it was the thin red line .  this years  winner  is the hurricane  pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool .  acclaimed director norman jewisons biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun .  and thats supposed to be ok because  see  its a true story .  its about rubin  hurricane  carter ( denzel washington )  a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! )  detective ( dan hedaya ) whos had it in for the  big-shot  hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares  right ? )  when rubin was only ten .  he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole .  most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison .  to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives .  lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna  unger  schreiber ) to get an education .  lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book --  the sixteenth round   rubins autobiography .  immediately thereafter  schreibers character tells lesra  sometimes we dont pick the books we read  they pick us .   hmmm .  after a few visits to the prison  they become convinced of rubins innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him .  they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricanes innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings .  of course  were already told that hes innocent .  a movie like this is especially frustrating because were not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life .  all too obviously  were getting the hollywood watered- down version .  that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it .  its almost cruel .  the melodrama isnt of the entertaining kind either ; its the hokey  rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity .  witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists .  the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except its a no-frills courtroom movie .  its formula stripped to the bare necessities .  you have your wrongly accused black man .  you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene .  but theres nothing else .  youd expect some sort of involving investigation .  but thats not necessary since were implicitly informed of his innocence .  thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding .  brooding to himself .  brooding to other inmates .  brooding to lesra .  brooding to lesras canadian friends .  brooding in letters .  i dont think ill ever look at brooding the same way again .  it wasnt long before i got tired of hearing the hurricanes exceedingly deep meditations on his condition .  i wanted something to happen .  as for washingtons performance in the title role -- i figured id have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention its received -- he is top notch  though still boring .  how is that possible ?  well  he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly .  unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap .  what a waste of a great performer .  speaking of wastes  why the hell did john hannah agree to do this ?  hes an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly  but what is he doing here ?  to call his character ( along with schreibers and ungers ) a stick figure would be a gross understatement .  all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas  as benevolent as do-gooders come .  if theyre to play a major part in this movie  why not make them real people  with real feelings and emotions ?  look : if youre going to make a formula movie  dont undermine the formula .  courtroom dramas can be fun  but this is ridiculous .  not only is it trite  its boring . 
all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos  please raise your hands .  thank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away .  your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade  and it shows no sign of abating any time soon .  it isnt just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing  or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised  featuring the music of . . .  no  it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected  banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles .  welcome to the club  scott kalvert .  your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional  serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole .  dicaprio stars as jim carroll  the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based .  as the film opens  jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey ( mark wahlberg )  pedro ( james madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw ) .  one night  jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine  and shortly thereafter to heroin .  jims addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral  as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach ( bruno kirby )  kicked out of his home by his mother ( lorraine bracco )  and drops out of school .  along with mickey and pedro  jim becomes a victim of the street  living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower .  the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years  but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner .  screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carrolls posse  resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic  but now with equally unsympathetic friends .  as a film  the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale  a 100 minute long  just say no  public service announcement  but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie .  jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie  but i suppose that his pseudo-sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out .  perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those  good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd  that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd .  without a character who changes in any appreciable way  the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts  all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack .  director scott kalvert doesnt have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work  so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography  self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing .  on only one occasion  when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in  are any of the gimmicks effective .  mostly  they just draw attention to how hollow the story is .  they also dont allow leonardo dicaprios performance to be as strong as it could have been .  for every impressive moment  like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money  there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics .  dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors  particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out  but kalvert wont let character interaction define this story .  he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star  shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting .  at isolate moments  the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprios talents .  far more frequently  it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like . 
depending on your degree of cinematic acumen  last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawas 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leones 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line .  new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined  much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons .  the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing  which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material  the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ .  it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself .  this time around  the man with no name is played by bruce willis  a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico .  by all appearances  jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town  with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border .  one is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) .  calling himself john smith  the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict  and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyles side .  but smiths allegiance is as uncertain as his name  and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them .  viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint  and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations .  there is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern )  the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses affections ( karina lombard )  the barkeep who becomes our anti-heros only friend ( william sanderson )  suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses trust in smith  a brutal beating  and a big fire .  director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids  including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity  but at least he doesnt try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture .  what he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake  and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction .  yes  that narration is full of cliches  but those are are not particularly troubling .  the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters .  they were a mystery  to the other characters in the film and to the audience  their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted  and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status .  with john smiths voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought  he becomes more mundane  just another tough guy trying to stay alive .  it feels like a hammett novel  all right  and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice  but it simply doesnt work .  the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence  and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence .  even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate  i cant imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction .  willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith  but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else .  christopher walken plays doyles brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos  and there isnt another single character whom makes even the slightest impression .  with no compelling antagonist for smith  there is no build-up towards the expected showdown  and when it does come  that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about .  cinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hills 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas  but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration .  sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original  theyll wonder what all the talk was about .  in the case of last man standing  it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . 
okay  bear with me yall  cause first off i have to get this off my chest :  what the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ?  whew . okay .  cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end  as cute as the crab maybe .  even i know that you need more footage than * that * .  and that wasnt the only thing getting on my nerves .  the cutesy gimmicks  saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during  oh  say the first 10 minutes of the movie .  at first the movie moves along at a quick  interesting pace .  it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street  whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesnt * die .  a ridiculous concept  yes  but at this point im willing to accept it because im willing to accept that this is how amandas life is changed  how her powers are received .  later on  the movie cant seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom .  and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying ; they werent just repetitive  they were out of place and unnecessary .  the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed  sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef  her falling in love with tom  etc . )  sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good .  some places the plot just doesnt make sense  sometimes its way too contrived ( the crab bit  for example )  and sometimes too corny ( peaches emitting dry ice .  cant beat that ) .  all in all the plot seemed fragmented  unconnected .  not romantic at all  and only funny in some places .  so  okay  do the magic powers come from the crab ?  or the fairy godfather ?  she can * float * now too ?  and all of a sudden  instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches  she can put her emotions into her food ?  tom all of a sudden just accepts amandas  witchcraft  in the end ?  would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupacs video ?  what the hell is up with that damn crab ?  it is unfortunate  because i liked the basic premise of the movie  until it became too fantastical and tiresome .  the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while  but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables .  the humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits  including that incomprehensible  totally random thing with the dolls ) .  gellar and flannery are qualified actors  and gellar has a particular charm  but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy ( or even annette in the upcoming  cruel intentions  ) than this sorry excuse for a character .  its almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is  or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible .  the supporting character nolan was a highlight  though he reminded me a bit of kevin in  youve got mail  ( see footnotes ) .  and  as always  typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy  theres a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background  cued up at all the right places .  this sort of got on the nerves after a while  too .    simply irresistible  is not hard to understand  light  funny in some places  and generally disappointing because it cant draw the line between romance and protracted sap  between humor and tired slapstick .  and how could i refrain from making a pun ?   .   .   .    simply irresistible  is all too easy to resist .   ( first viewing  2/6/99 )   * did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to  youve got mail  ( or  the shop around the corner  ) ?  business rivals fall in love .  female counterparts business is in danger of being shut down .  female as mother- like figure guiding her .  the annoying  hysterical ex-girlfriends .   * i _really_ like sarah michelle gellars wardrobe . 
i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes .  the original film  released last summer  was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor .  unfortunately  my hopes were soon dashed .  as the movie opens  the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville  maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie .  its a mostly humorous  self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film .  during this segment  we are introduced to the protagonist  a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website .  the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously .  we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia  but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies .  we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him .  we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him .  no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact  these scenes are barely referred to again .  i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally  a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting  filthy interiors  and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie .  the movie cuts again  this time to the present .  the young man  whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie  the character names are identical to the actors names  although this movie admits up front that it is fictional  so theres no reason for the practice this time around )  is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the  blair witch hunt   which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website .  we meet tristen and steven  a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience .  steven is a skeptic  believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria .  tristen  on the other hand  believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence .  she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly .   ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant  and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out .  how did i know ?  because in bad movies  nauseated women are always pregnant . )  the fourth member of their party is erica  a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch  not evil .  they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery .  kim is dressed completely in black  has extreme goth-style makeup on  and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities  but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch .  presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; its never explained .  the party of five heads off into the woods as promised .  they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parrs house and set up camp  complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the nights events .  there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well  but after a few words are exchanged  the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere .  the movie veers off at this point to spend many long  long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down .  sexual innuendoes are tossed around  much hard liquor  beer  and pot is consumed  and nothing much else happens .  this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary .  the next day  the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed  and that steven and tristens manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds  like snow .  the videotapes are missing  but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim  they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house   right where the original blair witch tapes were found !   ooh .  spooky .  the team goes back to jeffreys house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes .  they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night .  wacky hijinks ensue .  tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch  everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies  steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations  and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket .  throughout the entire ordeal  jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes  which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in  mutters something about  reverse   and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards .  when they do this  they discover what really happened during the five lost hours .   ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes .  okay  if the videotapes were being buried  then how were they recording themselves . . . oh   nevermind . )  this movie was awful .  simply awful .  the characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development .  erica is the nature-loving wiccan .  tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman .  steven is the overbearing asshole .  kim is the antisocial goth girl .  old  tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures .  how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ?  because shes pregnant !  how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ?  because she wears a lot of eye makeup !  how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ?  because he has jagged teeth and talks like hes straight out of  deliverance  !  this is weak storytelling at its worst .  rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic  the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics  in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action .  it didnt work .  on top of being poorly developed  most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid .   (  honey  you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie .  lets get on a plane home .     no .  i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out whats going on .     ok .  )  frankly  by the end of the movie  i was rooting for the witch .  i also felt that there was simply too much blood n gore in this film .  the first movie worked by never showing us the horror .  the witch was a palpable presence in that movie  but we never saw it ; we never saw anything  in fact .  the horror was all off-screen  and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be .  this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie .  blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out .  this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffreys throat  and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort .  knives plunge into flesh  bloody fingers trail off into the darkness  and none of it is explained until the very end  when it was too late for me to care .  this movie didnt stop with showing us the gore  either ; it went for broke and showed us everything .  by the end of the movie  there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours .  it is all explained ; in fact  it is all shown on-screen in loving detail .  i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster  or see only brief glimpses  mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying  but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying .  i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no  monster   that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind .  i found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the directors intent  then he needs to have some words with the writer  because it was not made clear at all .   ( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so .  and if there was no witch  then what about the vanishing tree ?  the snowfall of manuscript paper ?  hm ? )  blair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie .  from the poorly-written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross-out shots  it was a bad effort through and through . 
im giving this stinker .  normally  the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be .  but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is  compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive  helped me come to the big goose egg .  im not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing  or if he was even thinking at all .  maybe in mels little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny .  in mine  its not .  or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking .  because only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one .  at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing .  brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it .  wrong mel !  i would call you a boob mel  but that insults breasts everywhere .  this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governors ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad .  he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out .  but the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired  and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them .  the governor pawns the task off to kormans character hedley lamarr .   ( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name . )  lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave .  hold on  ive got to stop while these gales of laughter pass .  its just too funny .  racism passing as humor -- gosh why didnt anybody ever think of that one before ?  oh wait  i think somebody might have -- they are called the kkk .  im not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldnt know what was funny if it hit him over the head .  but i digress .  anyway  the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n-word .  golly  will the hilarity just never end ?  he ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder )  who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west .  together  they save the day from evil .  not one person in this movie gives a decent performance .  wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie  and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie .  ok  he really didnt -- but he should have .  the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day .  i did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience .  i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions .  actually  the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise  but alas  it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie .  i can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever .  mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film . 
2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off .  it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways .  im not going into much greater detail than that  since it would take forever to explain  and quite frankly  im not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that ive already wasted .  while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction  2 days in the valley falls way short .  this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello  james spader and jeff daniels .  while the story isnt much  and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better  2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots .  james spaders character  while not much better than the rest  is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way .  and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron ( in her first role ) .  you know a movie isnt that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women .  even if they are both gorgeous .  i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted .  but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result .  while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting  they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about .  if i were to put a number on it  only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch .  this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent  and even then prepare for disappointment .  not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again .  or at least not all of it anyway . 
what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie ?  a better question  what would inspire a studio to produce said movie ?  if you have an answer  let me know .  foolish  the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw-droppingly horrible film  one with no redeeming value socially  cinematically or otherwise .  comedically it has some potential  but only in its stand-up comedy moments  which i can turn on comedy central for .  master p stars as fifty dollah ( beat that ! ) as a mobster ( i think ) who is trying to start a comedy club/act with his little brother foolish ( eddie griffin ) .  but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay  for the very first time entertaining )  a stubborn club owner and family problems ( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger eberts  idiot plot   if everyone here wasnt an idiot  there would be no problem )  so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names ?  not a hell of a lot .  as i have mentioned  master p cannot act or write .  he acts like the rapper that he is .  the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced  as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro .  as for his script -- well  i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience .  if you havent yet figured it out  that is not saying much .  co-star eddie griffin ( really the star of the show ) is quite a different story .  the fact of the matter is that griffin  whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network  is an extremely talented comedian  stand-up and otherwise .  he has much in common with chris tucker ( rush hour  money talks ) in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips .  he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity ( to the extent which that can be done )  and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie .  and indeed  i laughed at a few stand-up scenes here  but from a feature-length movie i expect more .  foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters .  every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke ( in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers  foolish blurts out towards his jewelry-sporting sibling  you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush  ) or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car ( to which i said  a bit too loudly for the occasion  huh ?  ) after getting slightly upset with his wife .  believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard-earned $8 .  youll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you dont have cable .  eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative ( although offensive ) yarn  but everyone else should stay the hell away .  &#137 ; 
synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar .  the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary  while his wife disapproves .  meanwhile  a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession .  comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ?  its hard to speculate .  most of this film takes place during the day  and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky  pulsating  bubbling brain thingie in a jar .  in case you havent picked up on this yet  possessed by the night is a bottom-of-the-barrel  thriller  ( i use the term  thriller  loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad .  the plot  which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s  actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible .  writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging .  theres really not much to say .  the acting is lousy ; although  occasionally  the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience .  most humorous is frank sivero  who plays murray  the novelists agent .  he is so horrible in this role that one cant help but be amused .  the plot sucks .  nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession  even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole .  the dialogue stinks .  a loan shark  for instance  tells another how much he loves bimbos  which is something the audience really doesnt need to know .  everything about possessed by the night is second rate  even the film credits .  as the names of the not-so-talented film crew scrolled by at the end  joseph scales came up  credited as being  assistsant to foley artist .   someone could have used an editor !  to be honest  the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes .  playboy playmate shannon tweed  after all  is the star here .  i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing  he would like this movie .  why did i give this turkey two stars and not one ?  as a bad movie  it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film .  if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night  however  id recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else . 
okay  okay .  maybe i wasnt in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii  even while admitting that it wasnt as good as the others .  howewer  the latest segal picture didnt look that bad  and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them  i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash .  boy  was i wrong !  in the first half of the movie  we are already assaulted with segals acting  ( he is not simply wooden ; he is like a wall )  gratuitous violence  an incredible plot  sexist and even more gratuitous nudity  and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes .  by the end  it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers .  not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided  which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense .  of course  in movies like these  there must be a sidekick  and a love interest .  in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model ( in the movie )  which only functions as a supposed comic relief ( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines )  and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie .  oh  of course  she appears naked from the waist up  and  of course  segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interested in each other .  i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie .  often  the villain saves the movie ; unfortunately  the villains here are cartoonish  stupid and unfunny  unmenacing .  how many movies have psycho ex-special forces bad guys ?  too many .  i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie  including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death  the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him  the scene where we are shown the heros superiors are stupid  the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand  etc . . .  simply said  this is movie-making by the numbers  boring  and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience .  my recommendation : if you go see it  bring a watch .  youll be looking at it for most of the movie .  my .  rent die hard .  read a book .  stare at the sky .  do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid .  the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen ; once again  dragged in by my friends  which by the way  liked the movie halfheartedly .  they probably like wrestling too : - ) . 
kevin smith is like a big kid .  his humor is that of a sophisticated juveniles .  he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books  having also written a few .  he also has a cult following  mostly composed of teenagers  college students  and smiths own fellow adolescent-minded grownups .  smith is hilarious in person and in writing  but when he tries to be earnest and moralize  that is when he goes wrong .  kevin smith is a better writer than director  and hell be the first to tell you that .  that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed .  great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them .  this was true in the overrated chasing amy  and it is true for dogma as well .  that is not to say smiths message is a bad one .  in dogma  smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and gods desires is superior to anyone elses .  basically  dogmatism is bad .  changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible  and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight  they also know what is best for you  whether you like it or not .  this is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind )  but i have no problems with recycling old ones  particularly since dogmas protesters are proving smiths point .  smiths own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book .  but this is smiths personality  and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran  etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns .  the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god  metatron ( alan rickman )  to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels  bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death  loki ( matt damon ) .  along the way  forgotten thirteenth apostle  rufus ( chris rock )  stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek )  and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethanys aid .  fallen muse  azrael ( jason lee )  proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery .  the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smiths points  and in itself  has little dramatic momentum .  among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman  jesus was black  and the bible was written by a bunch of racist  misogynistic white men .  of course  kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself .  they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic .  smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie .  when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes  smith thought it might give validation to protesters claims that the film was sacrilegious  but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke .  the films humor is uneven .  some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance .  but many of the films jokes just bomb  as in virtually anything involving salma hayeks serendipity .  also  some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away .  still  smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace .  among the actors  fiorentino and rickman stand out by far .  fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight .  damon and affleck are fairly lackluster .  rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith .  but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob  who recur in all of smiths movies  are much more in line with smiths brand of humor .  bud cort  george carlin  janeane garofalo  guinevere turner  and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances . 
review : ghost dog : the way of the samurai ( 1999 )  cast : forest whitaker  henry silva  cliff gorman  john tormey  gene riffini  victor argo  tricia vessey  isaach de bankole  camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch  rating : good shot ( stars )  languid  yet pointed and focused  ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek  ultra-cool  cinematic image of the hitman .  juxtaposing the samurais honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia  it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptors precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber  dinosaur-like  to function in the modern era .  director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast  ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit .  using a palate of bleached colors  jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film .  he doesnt cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized  stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies .  the action is presented in flat  brutal codas .  bullets have permanence .  death has consequences .  the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty .  it is an anti-movie  of sorts .  there are few photogenic  empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with .  this isnt a film that lovingly holds your hand .  there are dark  contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder  just so  asserting itself for all to see .  the fulcrum for the movies thematic balancing act is ghost dog  a mafia hitman .  a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer  ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms .  unlike the sleek  muscular killing machines one is accustomed to  we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly  replete with chapped  dirty hands and rumpled clothing .  he wears a hooded sweatshirt  which he often pulls over his head  giving him a monk-like appearance .  there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal .  he uses old  worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical  efficient and pleasureless fashion .  ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai  distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book  which he reads daily  hagakure : the way of the samurai .  life consists of simple pleasures for him : ice cream  warm rooftop naps and good books .  ghost dog lives  as it were  by the basic tenet expressed by his book ; one should start each day considering oneself as dead .  living atop an abandoned building  surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons  ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends .  he craves nothing more .  as he puts it late in the film   ive seen all i want to see .   he exists in a spiritual world of the mind  gaining moral sustenance from his readings .  ghost dog wasnt always as he is presented .  in several roshomon-like flashbacks  its shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan  that  samaritan  being a foot soldier in an aging crime family .  ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man  louie ( tormey )  as repayment .  after years of loyal service  ghost dog is sent  by louie  to kill  handsome frank   a made man within louies organization who has run away with the crime bosss daughter  louise ( vessey ) .  ghost dog wordlessly executes his task  witnessed by louise  whom he spares  as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon  clutching a copy of the book  roshomon .  in a bit of synchronicity  louise loans the book to ghost dog .  upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family  the mob bosses  in turn  put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade .  the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict .  the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again  each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dogs world .  each time a character is shown watching a cartoon  its from the same era  betty boop  felix the cat  etc .  a reflection of days gone by .  near the end  louise is watching a cartoon thats a departure from the previously shown ones .  its a bit of audacity on jarmuschs part that is nicely effective  despite its surrealistic nature .  as ghost dog floats through his world  his life is touched by two people .  one is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading .  she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities  just as louise ultimately does .  by films end  the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer .  the other person in ghost dogs world is an ice cream ( de bankole ) vendor who only speaks french  yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog .  the vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land .  jarmusch  through rapper/composer rza  underscores his film with rap and reggae music  which at first blush seems dichotomous  but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie .  ghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars .   ( which  in and of itself  presents another paradox about ghosts dogs sense of honor . )  the head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation .  of all the cartoonish mobsters  he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world .  gorman plays sonny  a lieutenant who respects the old ways  yet has a quirky affinity for rap music  a love comically shown in several impromptu displays .  ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia .  he is a husk of a man  assisted by two hearing aids  who barks out advice without truly hearing what he  or others are saying .  whitaker carries the film by using what truly great actors use  his face .  ghost dog is reticent to speak  often going for long periods without doing so .  the fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent .  although the film has a deliberate pace  some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down .  truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob .  he reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world .  carried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker  ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon  into a figure that garners sympathy  if not a bit of pity . 
i rented  brokedown palace  last night blind  having heard nothing about it beforehand  and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws .  for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety .  that is no easy task .  superficially  it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies  notably  return to paradise  and  midnight express .   as a result nearly every review of  brokedown palace  i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons .  the consequence was nearly universal condemnation  which is a shame as this is a fine film .  for those who have yet to view the movie  let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was  midnight express  ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of  return to paradise .   in my view  if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrads acclaimed novel   lord jim .   problematically  the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man  a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world  justice  system .  the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) .  theyre life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii  and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents .  once there  they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing  which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside .  they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room  a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them  but they are saved from hotel security by a charming  friendly australian  nick ( daniel lapaine )  who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girls scam .  he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves  first toward alice  then toward darlene .  by now alarm bells are going off among viewers .  the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories dont add up ( to us ) --the girls  of course  are too naive to notice .  long before it happens  were anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin .  just as predictably  the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch .  left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice .  for those in need of a ready answer  might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girls fleabag hotel .  as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed  the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer  yankee hank  ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife .  a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the films tag lines   who do you trust ?   and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullmans oeuvre will find few surprises .  much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion .  lou diamond phillips  for instance  plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who  while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank  withholds vital information at crucial moments .  is he part of a wider conspiracy ?  with an inherently powerful  if somewhat tired premise  the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama  a prison story  and a potential character study of american teens  their relationship  and what constitutes friendship between them .  the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful  with the girls interaction  hanks investigation  and the various trials and hearings  offering hope for their release  delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape .  if  brokedown palace  has a major flaw  it is its creators tendency  like time-constrained tourists  to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the storys main avenue .  and  if that were all there was to  brokedown palace   it wouldnt be a very good movie .  but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and  in this  they succeeded .  for the main theme of the movie  like the proffered name of its location  is freedom--in all its permutations .  ultimately  the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing .  young and pretty  alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild  streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure .  presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang  dark and light  is her cautious best friend  darlene ( beckinsale ) .  clear-eyed and straightforward  alice is more complex than her friend .  she comes from a poorer background  has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) .  whereas darlenes life is  on-track   aimed at college  marriage  kids  a career  a suburban home  middle age and  fulfillment   alices is uncertain  unfocused  and yearning .  one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home  whose lives continue while hers is in limbo .  tellingly  alice is present but not included .  just as revealing of their different personalities  when alice and dar first come to thailand  the openness and delight on alices face doesnt read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat  reaching toward the sun  she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom  while  dar  remains seated in the shade .    brokedown palace  begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank .  however unintentional  its all alices fault .  shes responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents  to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand  to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick .   ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a films beginning  darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . )  dar  of course  is the willing dupe which  in her view  confers innocence .  never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate .  dar is innocent .  it doesnt matter .  alice is the subject of this movie .  she and her journey toward personal freedom .  along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals .  in the end  that culture  like its representatives   yankee  hank and dars father ( a  man who knows how to grease the wheels  )  proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girls tragedy .  thailands culture  contrary to most opinion  comes off much better by comparison .  it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes .  i believe the filmmakers view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior .  the thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles .  the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born .  their prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole  being relatively clean and sunlit .  the prison authorities demanded good hygiene  provided medical care when needed  and  hard manual labor  consisted of picking grass !  the thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic .  as for the thai justice system  the reasoning of the thai judges  during both an appeal hearing and in the films penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality .  freedom has many faces and  brokedown palace  explores many of them .  in the extreme  we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit .  some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter .  but freedom seldom comes without a price .  which is why the movies other tag lines are :  what is your dream ?   and  how far would you go ?   i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom  incarcerated or not  by films end is alice .  she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility .  i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact .  kate beckinsales character might more properly be likened to the  released  temple bird referred to twice during the film   trained to fly back to its cage .   as the thai magistrate observed in the films climactic scene  the issue was always one of  character ;  and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that  freedom  is achieved within oneself .  if one thinks back over the movie  which character was transformed by their experiences ?  increasingly  the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of kung fu woman--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures .  here  at last  is the story of a modern heroine .  in reading the many users comments  i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie  almost everyone praised the actors .  think about that .  when was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it  but raving about all the performances in it ?  do yourself a favor : rent  brokedown palace  and watch it with a open mind .  theres more there than meets the eye . 
everyones heard about this movie  and more specifically  * the * scene .  everyones heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over .  and everyones got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance .  good !  thats what youre supposed to do !  oh  if you are one of the ones who hasnt seen this yet  or you ( somehow ) havent heard about what happens  heres your spoiler warning .  deliverance was a real shocker for its time ( 1972 ) .  major advances were being made in films  and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry .  when it was first released  it literally shocked the audiences .  it was something that  for the most part  had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating ) .  but by todays film standards and in todays world  such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isnt as shocking  although they can be even more graphic ( e . g .  pulp fiction ) .  pulp fiction did it in a way  and expanded on it in a way  that it could even be interpreted as funny .  but in 1972  deliverance was no laughing matter .  the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory .  the initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime )  a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others .  joining him are ed ( jon voight )  bobby ( ned beatty )  and drew ( ronny cox ) .  the groups first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip .  they make arrangements with a few mountain men  who accept $40 . 00 for the task .  drew also has the famous  dueling banjos  competition with a local who is  let us say  genetically challenged .  the men then set off down the river  with lewis  also the master at canoeing  leading the way .  everything seems to be going fine  until the two canoes split up  leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone .  they encounter two hillbillies  armed with a shotgun  who captured them .  ed is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men .  ed nearly receives the same cruelty  but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapists back .  the other hillbilly gets away  and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body .  disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film .  while attempting to make a quick  paddle for it   both canoes tip over .  drew  who was without a life jacket  was possibly shot and cannot be found .  lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition .  this leaves ed and bobby .  ed decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly  alone  with the bow and arrow .  the question arises if he will be able to handle himself  as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer  to which his comment  i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing  will have more meaning in the future .  deliverance is definitely a wild ride ( oops  im doing it again ) .  it is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic .  its definitely one of those  must see  movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade . 
in october of 1997  audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer .  the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u . s .  and even developed a cult following  much like the previous years 100 million dollar grossing scream .  when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend  it looked like a wonderful follow-up .  did it live up to the first film ?  the answer is no .  jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james  a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before .  she has been so upset since the incident .  nightmares haunt her all over the place  but she has to move on .  she know attends college  and is best friends with a funny  outgoing girl named karla ( brandy )  who is trying to hook julie up with will benson  played by newcomer matthew settle .  karlas boyfriend is tyrell  the funny  outgoing type  who is played by soul foods mekhi phifer .  freddie prinze jr . also returns as ray  julies boyfriend from a year ago .  one morning  julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil .  of course  they answer it correctly  and they are off to the bahamas .  julie wants ray to come  but he declines the offer  so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie .  after they arrive at their hotel  it is just them and the staff on the island .  it starts off as the weekend of their dreams .  something just had to come to mess up the one care-free weekend of julies life though .  ben willis ( muse watson ) is back  and he isnt letting anyone survive this time .  will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ?  jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances .  brandy in particular was impressive  considering this is her first feature film .  you could see that the characters were horrified  and they would do anything possible to survive .  matthew settle and freddie prinze jr . are a completely different story .  lets start with settle .  matthew is completely fake in this film .  you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth .  you could tell he was acting  and its reasons like him that this one isnt as good as the first one .  he does do a good job towards the end  but that doesnt clear up the scars he already left on the film .  freddie prinze jr . is almost as bad as matthew settle was .  he is almost completely unbelievable  and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place .  we dont see him as much as settle  otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did .  mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell  but yet again the dialogue is out of place .  the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie .  i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment  but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one  it would have been a bit better .  the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful .  there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel .  the sound is pretty good  but still not as creepy as the first films .  jennifer love hewitts song   how do i deal  is also played for about thirty seconds .  i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film .  the first film was very suspenseful  and it contained some very memorable scenes .  the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up  and almost reached the same level as the first film .  before this part in the film  there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares .  that is okay though  because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes .  i think the reason this film wasnt as scary as the original was because in the first one  the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident .  he made them suffer for what they did .  in the second film  ben willis just kills anyone he feels like .  he doesnt stick with ray and julie  who were the ones he is actually after .  he had to go after karla  will  and tyrell .  if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie  ray  helen  and barry  it could have been much better  and it would have made a lot more sense .  the bottom line- not a disappointment  but a third in the series would be out of hand . 
brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly .  since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987  depalma has seen casualties of war  raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames .  consequently  it would be easy enough to consider carlitos way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma  reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes .  it doesnt hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn .  carlitos way  while hampered by depalmas characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism  is a truly tense and engrossing drama .  carlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance .  in 1975  carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality .  he declares himself reformed  tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas .  among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn )  carlitos crooked attorney and childhood friend  and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) .  carlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller )  and seems ready to retire in peace .  old ways die hard  though  and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he cant seem to shake .  carlitos way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film .  in the first  carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station .  both highlight depalmas gift for choreographed mayhem  and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely .  yet for all the viscera  i found the character study even more compelling .  carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him  an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit .  but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera  theres more of an immediacy to carlitos way  an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion .  you sense that theres no way  after so many years  that carlito can stay out of trouble .  indeed  he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart :  you dont get reformed ; you just run out of wind .   pacino captures carlitos dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy .  sean penn is even better  turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld .  a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys  kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder .  he could have been simply pathetic  a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league  but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct .  he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink  making the moment he goes over quite jolting .  as compelling as the narrative is  viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu .  depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors  this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas .  he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms  like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables .  from a story standpoint  theres an obligatory love story with a cliched long-suffering girlfriend character .  penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesnt do anything new with the role  and eventually she becomes just a distraction  never integrated fully enough into the story .  still  its easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid .  the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention  one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldnt break .  carlitos way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate  confident and powerful .  those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded . 
ive never been a huge fan of jeff bridges  but i loved him in the big lebowski .  the part of jeff  the dude  lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind  and the fit is perfect .  the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles  a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians .  hes enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes .  after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy  but not before they urinate on his rug .  the dude assumes that these  collection agents  were after another jeff lebowski  a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug .  the millionaire refuses  but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped .  he wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers .  dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task  and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers  millionaires  high schoolers  nihilists  artists  pornographers  thugs  and league bowlers .  comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres  so take my recommendation as you will : for me  the big lebowski is very funny .  it is an incredibly successful comedy  the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films .  not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together  but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure .  all the characters end up as the butt of jokes  but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived .  each person may be a comic caricature  but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension .  the characters are firmly established  and they never change their behavior for a quick  cheap laugh .  its not what they do thats funny  its who they are  which is why the acting is so important  and so successful  in this movie .  worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( thats jee-zus  not hay-soos )  the greaser bowler whos in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as  vaginal ;  steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling  long-winded narrator .  aside from the performances  what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue .  people lose trains of thought  they interrupt  they boast  they repeat themselves  they repeat their friends . . .  they sound natural .  taken with fargo  the coen brothers last film  it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers .  ethan coen is not just good at directing actors  hes also good at technical directing .  he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film .  perhaps  beautiful  is the wrong word ; nihilists  carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty .  but the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed  as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film .  all around  the big lebowski is great  solid comedy .  outstanding acting  writing  direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success . 
synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600  the baku  from the evil admiral dougherty and ruafro .  the enterprise crew  in the meantime  experience the rejuvenating qualities of the baku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple  data sings opera pieces  picard scores with a baku chick  riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi  and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts .  comments :  star trek : the next generation  was a hugely successful sequel tv series to  star trek   a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s .  even though it still enjoyed high ratings   star trek : the next generation  ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original  star trek  s cast in paramounts film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise .  star trek : insurrection is the ninth  star trek  movie and the third to focus on the  star trek : the next generation  crew .  star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans  such as myself  would rate somewhere between  okay  and  good .   after star trek v : the final frontier  a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant  star trek : voyager  tv series   star trek  fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise .  i dont wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies .  most people reading this probably havent followed  star trek  anyway  so a comparison would seem tedious at best .  let me  thus  make my comparisons briefly so that its out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment  star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrections comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie .  okay . lets move to the movie itself .  star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise  humanitys exploration and colonization of space  with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners .  this combination works well more often than it fails  but when it does fail  the humor really seems cheesy .  much of this film appeals to trek fans nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprises crew .  audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times .  star trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the baku homeworld .  forget the actors and special effects  the beautiful setting of this movie  with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys  steals the show .  this tranquility  however  is broken by data  an android  who reveals to the baku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies  the sona .  it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth  sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young  healthy state .  the enterprise crew  led by captain picard  investigates datas actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the sona and an enterprise admiral to relocate the baku and plunder the planets youth-restoring properties .  sound pretty heavy ?  it is  though this plot  anything but unique and groundbreaking  is undermined by the films constant barrage of humor .  when going after data  for instance  picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) .  in a much more funny sequence  work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the baku homeworld  a pimple which his crewmates  try as they might  cannot avoid looking at .  the acting in star trek : insurrection is  for the most part  pretty good .  since theyve been playing these characters for years  those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough .  the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech  picards trademark  with his usual aplomb .  brent spiner  another fine actor  plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) .  the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good .  despite many other critics negative opinions  f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ruafro well enough .  ruafro reminds me  somewhat  of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune .  like the baron  ruafro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants .  in one particularly memorable scene  ruafro becomes very agitated  and his facial skin splits open and bleeds .  ruafro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations .   ( okay  i promise  no more comparisons . )  donna murphy must also be noted as a baku woman  anij  who picard falls in love with .  murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance .  this is the type of woman whom picard  for those who know the character well  would be enchanted with .  in fact  the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here .  a particular plot point involving anijs ability to slow time down  an ability which she shares with picard  becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie .  for as good as the actors and setting were  star trek : insurrections special effects were surprisingly disappointing .  they proved adequate  sometimes barely  for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film  but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) .  the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships  in particular  seemed trite and unsuspenseful  and the final confrontation between picard and ruafro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite .  the new enterprise itself  only seen in this film and its predecessor  remains largely unexplored  though its exterior doesnt look quite right for a reason i cannot explain .  despite star trek : insurrections frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects  i enjoyed the film .  it maintains roddenberrys largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors  particularly star trek : first contact ( though  dont get me wrong  the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) .  id recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon  especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general .  rated pg  i cant see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience  young or old . 
us critic-type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies arent thrill rides  but i think that  back to the future ii  is one of the few exceptions .  if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s  then this has the spirit of the 80s : full of fights ; chase scenes ; cliff hangers ; special effects ; some detective work ; and of course the vision of the high-tech future .  the film picks up exactly where the first film left off  with doc ( lloyd )  marty ( fox )  and jennifer ( elizabeth shue ) travelling 30 years into the future  because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifers kids .  doc tells marty he must take his sons place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr . says yes to griff ( wilson - in one of four different roles ) .  whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasnt joking  especially when it comes to the movies .  essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015  but its not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself .  at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better  and it seems like everythings copasetic right ?  wrong .  since when do things go according to plan in the  back to the future  movies ?  there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i wont even bother to list them all .  basically we get to see marty as an old man  his house  his family  etc . we also go back to an alternate 1985  and then back again to 1955  with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath .  the films best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle .  its difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail .  the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense .  instead of a grand finale  we get lots of little victories .  by the end everything is back to normal  but something happens that leads to yet another sequel  but it doesnt seem gratuitous .    back to the future part ii  is a really great adventure movie .  it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor . 
magnolia left me relling from the theatre  staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft .  at nearly three and a half hours  magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film .  it not only demands your attention  but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions .  it is delirious  depressing  heady  pretentious  surreal filmmaking .  its also a movie that will polarize its viewers .  director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast  wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesnt let up until an oddly exhilerating  biblically influenced pseudo-climax .  the characters make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives .  there is frank mackey ( tom cruise )  a slithery snake charmer of men whose  search and destroy  seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants .  there is earl partridge ( jason robards )  a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son .  there is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall )  a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public .  and there is police officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly )  who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system  perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process .  given equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters )  a former tv quiz show champion ( william h . macy ) .  a materialistic  adulterous wife ( julianne moore )  a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent  and a caring  empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman ) .  hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death  lies and despair .  it is not a pleasant movie .  there is not one bad note in the acting .  it is affecting and layered and wonderful .  there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films .  then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene .  walters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing .  robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man  who still hears a lions roar when he speaks .  director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote .  the problem is that he stays on them too long .  julianne moores character  linda  quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt  tears  screaming and remorse and never backs off from it .  after a few hours  it turns from interesting to chinese water torture .  quite a few scenes  such as the game show  go on just a bit too long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around .  and just what is the theme ?  alienation ?  hopelessness ?  anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesnt make it easy .  the film starts by showing three  strange and seemingly unrelated events .  its a harbinger of the synchronicity to come .  at times  different stories reach reach key moments at the same time .  other times  stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory  regardless of what else is happening .  anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film !  whats surprising is that it mostly works .  if you have doubts about andersons intentions  ill ask you to pay attention to the final frame .  despite all the sturm und drang  magnolia ultimately speaks to mans capacity for hope and attempts at redemption .  despite magnolias needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur  showing off fro the masses  i have to admire his guts .  this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling .  my rating : a bulleye .   ( stars )  a side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann .  her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful .  when she sings  save me  at the end  it enhances the yearning felt by the characters  just as  wise up  mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives . 
a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why todays youth seem attracted to black culture .  the review  if black & white  the new film from writer/director james toback  is eventually remembered for only one thing  it will be the revelation that brooke shields  claudia schiffer  marla maples and mike tyson can act .  however  this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that .  black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about americas youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious .  featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller  robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips )  tobacks is a complex film worth seeing .  black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other  a la robert altman .  there is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game .  this eventually spills over into the life of deans long-time friend rich ( power )  a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem .  rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf .  meanwhile  the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr . ) .  others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will  joe pantoliano as his district attorney father  jared leto as a high school teacher  marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens  claudia schiffer as deans girlfriend  and mike tyson as . . .  mike tyson .  the stories ebb and flow through the film  losing and gaining prominence over time .  friendships are lost  lovers are gained  and there is an occasional burst of violence .  originally rated nc-17 in the united states  black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls .  while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating  viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing .  the three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for  and several audience members got up and left at that point .  the frequent sex is one of the films few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film .  to tobacks credit  the level of violence in black & white is almost nil .  these gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns  and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way .  whenever a character finds himself on donagers handheld digital camera  he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence  but not everyone has fully bought into the idea .  charlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop  but admits that  in ten years time  ill be way over this .   these youth know they are going through a phase  and are simply enjoying it .  toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny .  most of the humour comes from mike tyson  who provides the films comic relief without really trying .  he is given big words like vernacular to say  and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson  he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better  playing on tysons image as a dimwit .  but tyson also gets the films scariest moment .  as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry  tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm .  the scene is entirely improvised  with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction .  the reaction he gets  being slapped and then choked is astonishing  as downey jrs face turns a frightening shade of purple .  black & white is a film about hip-hop culture  and the films omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this .  but toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does  toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one characters struggle .  thus black & whites message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself .  toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way .  and we do . 
one year has passed since the last time we saw them  and but wayne campbell and garth algar are back but  theyve moved out of their parents homes  and now have their own pad in an abandoned warehouse .  waynes still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend  cassandra  and of course garth is still having his own  personal growing pains .  they guys are just finishing off one of their shows  and head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra and her new manager  a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film .  again  the promoter is not only after the money that cassandras talent can bring in .  the storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original   guy loses chick  guy realizes mistake  and guy gets chick back .   fortunately  there is more to this movie than this somewhat sheer plot .  the wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color .  highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park  garths seduction by a married woman  a surprise appearance by charleton heston  a 1960s batman setup in the guys pad  and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison and some  naked indian guy   an unexpected lip-sync of ymca ( you could see that one coming a mile away ) and of course a hilarious parody of those badly-dubbed kung-fu movies we love to laugh at .  and if youve ever wondered why theres always boxes of watermelons  chickens  and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets  youll find out here .  this movie also explores wayne and garth a little more .  garth has somewhat of a  coming of age  and wayne gets to learn a little about himself ( with a little help from our old friend  jim morrison ) .  a few old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again  but this time with a few twists to keep them fresh  and luckily  few  if any of them are overused .  overall  the movie has plenty of continuity flaws ( especially in the fight scent between garth and cassandras dad )  but these are easily overlooked as this is  after waynes world .  the plot is flimsy but manageable .  there are a few special effects  but they are fairly seamless  and fill nicely into the plot .  the acting is good  for this sort of movie  but there are some very bright spots .  in the big picture  this movie is just plain fun .  there is lots of intelligent humor that makes this film special .  during the whole one hour and 40 minutes  i didnt even think about looking at my watch a single time .  silly  but riotous at times  this is an excellent movie even better than the original . 
john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has its good side and its bad .  its held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending thats pretty satisfying .  james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie .  the good side : some neat scenes of vampires and violence .  the bad : no scares .  yes thats right  even though being directed by one of horrors most cherished directors  vampires is the least bit scary  if not at all .  james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the master vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight .  daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya  a wise-cracking guy who really isnt that funny .  in the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters  find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy .  of course we all know sunshine kills vampires  and that is just how they kill these vampires : hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death .  after throwing a party for what happened  the vampires that did not die come back to trash it .  they kill almost all of jacks team  leaving only a few alive .  sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek  but not yet turned into a vampire .  she is rescued by jack and ? flees with them on their search for valek .  they have to fight theyre way against vampires  leading up to a finale that is well-done with great special effects .  vampires definately could have been done better .  the make-up  special effects and story are first rate  but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had .  it to me had more humor than horror  almost being compared to fright night with the mix of violence and comedy .  john carpenter does a great job of directing this film .  he eases through some tough times and saves the flaws  which are noticeable but forgettable .  the script is clever and funny  with many lines that make us laugh out loud .  i much enjoyed vampires with a few exceptions .  its one of those films you see but dont take to heart .  you enjoy the time you spent and go on .  the recently released psycho is the same way  its not as good as youd hope but it is fun and entertaining .  vampires is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer . 
in the wake of the smashing success of  rumble in the bronx   its looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release .  rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii .  the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; its widescreen and bilingually-subtitled  as are most hong kong films these days .  availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng .  the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small .  although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed  this review is of the subtitled version  so please keep that in mind if youre reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it .  to be fair  i must admit that ive never been very fond of  period-piece  martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past .  perhaps its because most of those ive seen were filmed on inferior stock  with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling  or perhaps its because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and  in many cases  all but nonexistant .  in fact  many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end .  or  for that matter  it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god  rumble in the bronx  etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts  often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions  whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts .  having said that  i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above  is one of the better martial arts films ive seen  and i quite enjoyed it .  surprised ?  well  so was i .  drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu .  where he learned this style is uncertain  as his father  wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hongs practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu .  apparently  fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore  rather like paul bunyan is for americans  but ive heard very little about this  and could quite well be wrong  so ill leave analysis of that to the people who know it better .  one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the  once upon a time in china  movies  but i have not yet seen those .  the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy  as are the plots to many such films  but if youre watching a jackie chan film  odds are you arent expecting something on the order of  war and peace  .  the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence  chinas cultural heritage ) while overworking  underpaying  and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill .  however  this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hongs perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend  supplicate his father  keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting  and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs .  the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners .  in the beginning  fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer .  in the process  he clashes with another thief  who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng .  after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners lackies  thanks to some timely intervention by a generals son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau  who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! )  comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng .  and so it goes .  and the plot thickens later on  such as when fei-hongs girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival  or when fei-hong and the thief  now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners  are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition )  but i think ive already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves .  lets move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the  action .  theres plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of  course  in a kung fu film  thats to be expected .  however  this isnt just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography  and jackie chan is a genius .  the primary martial arts  style  featured in the film is drunken boxing  a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk .  further  for the purposes of this film at least  drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but  theres a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor .  under normal circumstances  the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid  but jackie pulls it off with flair .  the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper  so ill just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching .  another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work .  even without motor vehicles ( well  not counting a train )  there are some remarkable stunts in this film .  among other things  jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once  but at _least_ twice  if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) .   ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . )  unlike in american films  these stunts are _not_ faked .  drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene  including jackie  ti lung (  a better tomorrow  1 & 2 )  and anita mui ( the  heroic trio  series   rumble in the bronx  ) .  the performances are first-rate  especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film .  the scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hongs fathers back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious  as is the scene where fei-hongs mother  having just revealed that she is pregnant  is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husbands anger away from fei-hong ) .  jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years  and hes in fine form all through drunken master ii .  as far as cinematography is concerned  it certainly works for this film .  its nothing spectacular  but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s .  the picture is crisp and clear .  one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that  at least in the copy i have  the screen was wider than any film ive ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below .   ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . )  it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release .  drunken master ii shows the full potential of  period piece  kung fu movies  and its good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies .  the plot does meander a bit  but thats to be expected in this type of film .  if you like this kind of movie  youll love this movie  and if not  well  give it a chance anyway .  if nothing else  the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . 
at first glance  three kings looks to be just another war movie  the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember .  the 90s version  it definitely is  just another war movie ?  not in your dreams !  imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan  thats three kings for you .  believe it or not  it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter .  the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war  with the allied troops victorious .  majpr archie gates ( clooney ) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree ; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert .  as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home  this `wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum-vee ( the vehicle of choice of the us army ) .  they soon find out that they have much resistance  as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces .  frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men  they become consciously attacked by their own morals .  as the film begins to roll  it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it .  `special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie .  three kings is much smarter than that .  as the conflict becomes more and more complex  the audience will be trapped in a limbo  trying to stay focussed on that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray .  i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film ; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity .  this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant .  action sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in-your-face war violence .  they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses  right before the action starts .  not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style ( tons of them starring clint eastwood ) .  great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film ; the screenwriter and the director .  three kings ranks among the best films of the year  well  for me at least .  highly recommended . 
mickey mouse had better watch his back -- theres a new critter in town  and hes the nameless animal attraction of  mouse hunt   dreamworks skgs clever first foray into family fare .  although it runs out of steam towards its end  this live-action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disneys entire 1997 non-animated  kiddie-oriented catalog . . .  but consider that list includes dismal tripe like  air bud    flubber  and  that darn cat   and its really not such a difficult feat to pull off .  still  throw the two rodents in a boxing arena  and ill be hoping that the mouse from  mouse hunt  knocks some sense back into mickey .  nathan lane ( robin williams significant other from  the birdcage  ) and lee evans ( last seen as a nervous bellhop in  the fifth element  ) play ernie and lars smuntz  befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father ( william hickey  in his last role ) -- a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion .  although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former  he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect .  but theres a lone obstacle in their way -- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house  and hes not about to give up his place of residence without a fight .  movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite .  the effects blending the talents of 60-some live mice  one animatronic mouse and one computer-generated mouse are pretty seamless .  the splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burtons mind ; the smuntzs architecturally-unsound mansion is like something straight out of  the nightmare before christmas   and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent prices warped contraptions from  edward scissorhands .     mouse hunt  is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim -- but its hardly ever mean-spirited .  the star of the show is neither the top-billed lane nor the titular mouse .  its lanky british comedian evans  whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned-up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill ( note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease ) ; evans banter with the ever-affable lane is funny stuff  too  and holds its own against the movies more flashy physical shtick .  vicki lewis ( beth from  newsradio  ) is solid in a supporting role as lars money-grubbing wife .  and in a nifty bit of novelty casting  christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously  popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a  calcium deficiency .   blech .  a basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans -- is given a rather engaging execution .  their sparring is imaginatively realized ( i dont think ill ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda )  and although you really never fully root for either side  thats okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share .    mouse hunt  may take a while to get going ( the rather lengthy set-up could test the patience of some of the younger children  although i rather liked it  much in part to lane and evans )  and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long  but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable  not unlike the original  home alone .  
a miracle of filmmaking   some like it hot  is a brilliant film  and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists .  it is the pinnacle of writer-director billy wilders career  a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make .  jerry ( lemmon ) and joe ( curtis ) are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig  trying to earn enough money to feed themselves .  one night  as theyre playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy  the place is raided .  as it turns out  the owner  spats columbo ( george raft ) was ratted out by toothpick charlie ( george e . stone ) .  several weeks later  on valentines day  jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage .  eager to escape  the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid .  the only catch . . its a girls band .  so josephine ( curtis ) and daphne ( lemmon )  make their way onto the train and go to florida .  on the way there  they meet sugar kane ( monroe )  a bombshell singer who is looking for love .  jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer  but theres two problems : 1 ) theyre in drag  and 2 ) millionaire osgood fielding ( joe e . brown ) falls madly in love with daphne .  what follows in pure hysteria  still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the  italian opera lovers festival  .  tony curtis is hysterical as joe/josephine  especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar .  marilyn monroe  in a wonderfully comic performance  is sugar  providing incredible timing and sex appeal  along with true sincerity .  the scenes  however  are all stolen by either brown or lemmon .  lemmon is hysterical as daphne .  cast as the less rational one  lemmons performance is ridiculously crazy  it is disorder in the style all billy wilders .  brown is particularly hilarious as osgood  as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony .  he manages to use lemmons ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire .  every set-piece is flawless  as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly  and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture .  wilders script is stunning  as he carefully combines gangsters  cross-dressing  romance  sex  music  gender roles  and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness .  wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria  so pitch-perfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece  the final line of this absolutely incredible film .  wilders is dead wrong when he says nobodys perfect : billy wilder is  especially when he makes something this disastrously funny .  nobodys perfect but billy wilder . 
a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings .  a prime example of this is 1999s 10 things i hate about you  which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school .  less successful was last years adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp . here the setting was the corporate world of new york .  now comes o  a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeares tragedies .  like 10 things i hate about you  the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general  the basketball teams standout player .  julia stiles  featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawkes hamlet  plays desi brable  odins girlfriend  whose father also happens to be dean of the institution .  josh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy  playing the scheming hugo  who sets the tragic wheels in motion .  o was actually filmed a couple of years ago  but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy .  the movie  directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother  where art thou ?  - and written by brad kaaya  is very grim .  an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits .  and that is how it should be .  of all of shakespeares tragedies  othello is the most harrowing  not because of any body count  but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago  whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery .  kaayas profane-filled script - after all  these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts .  the young man considers himself the basketball teams prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass  shoot  rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin .  plus his father  the teams coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood .  the script follows the familiar lines of the classic .  hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desis fidelity  eroding the stars confidence in those he considers closest to him  affecting both his relationships and his game .  it all ends in blood  of course  which is why the movie was originally shelved .  the performances in o vary .  phifer is at first cocky and self-assured  emotions he handles with ease .  he also does quite well displaying odins darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution  his growing distrust of those he loved  his rage and the erosion of his belief system .  hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit  turning friend against friend  and lover against lover .  stiles seems a bit stilted  but occasionally also rises to the occasion  moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight .  the film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugos theft of the school mascot is left hanging .  also desis actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan )  odins former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugos machinations  is puzzling .  why she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back .  it is irrational .  but these are minor carpings .  overall  o is a stylish and faithful adaptation .  if nothing else  it may encourage some people to read the original text  and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature . 
there is a scene early in soul food  george tillmans comedy-drama about a large african-american family and the ordeals they go through during a crisis  that caught me completely off guard .  during a wedding  the groom is flirting with some tramp  and in an attempt to to prevent a scene  his mother in law  played by irma p . hall  comes to the rescue .  the way in which she does this makes me think irma p . hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now .  however  this is just one magical moment in a movie filled with them .  vanessa williams  vivica fox  and nia long star as three sisters who have each gone their own way in life .  williams is teri  a successful lawyer  who is frustrated by her husband miles attempts at a music career .  fox is maxine  the strongest of the sisters  which can be confirmed by the stability of her marriage and the wisdom of her son ahmad  who narrates the film .  long is bird  a hairdresser who is the last of the three to get married .  her husband lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving .  at the center of everything is irma p . hall  as big mama jo .  every sunday  the family gathers together for dinner at mama jos house .  there is lots of conversation  lots of laughs  and the occasional controversy .  mama jo presides over the family like all mothers should .  she is stern and disciplined  but also caring and forgiving .  everything is going fine  until a tragedy befalls mama jo .  all of a sudden  a chain reaction of events begin to destroy the family .  it gets so bad  sunday dinner is even cancelled .  without mama jos guidance  there is noone to keep the family together  which frustrates ahmad .  miles and maxines marriage begins to fall apart  as he focuses on his music and flirts with the troublesome faith .  lems temper gets the best of him when his convict past starts to catch up to him .  and teri tries to prevent maxines efforts to sell mama jos house .  the third act of the film deals with ahmads attempts to patch things up .  he decides to take over where mama jo left off  and tries to get the family back together for one more sunday dinner .  the acting by everyone in the ensemble is outstanding  with special notices to irma p . hall and brandon hammond .  hall gives a performance that deserves to be recognized by the academy .  her mama jo is one of the most memorable characters i have ever encountered in a movie .  brandon hammond is an actor with a bright future .  he is wise enough not to play cutesy and shows an admirable range and depth  and speaks the final lines of the movie on the perfect note .  tillman obviously based this movie on his own memories of growing up .  every scene in the movie is purposeful and convincing ( except maybe an odd flashback sequence ) .  the dialogue is beleiveable and funny .  and then theres the food .  tillman gives us several close ups of the soul food  and it indeed looks very tasty .  i can see why sunday dinners became such a tradition for this family .  soul food is one of the most purely entertaining movies of the year . 
director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) .  film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story  but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something .  but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story .  so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential  the film almost automatically deserves a good review .  and when they add a fascinating story to it  you have nearly perfect entertainment .  finchers the game is no exception to this .  the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time .  fincher hasnt made a film since  seven   his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever .  so it is about time he made another film .  and what a ride it is .  the game isnt quite as powerful as  seven   but in some ways it is better .  overall  the game could have used a little more clarity  or a little more uncertainty .  it walks a line of insanity and reality  but it never goes either way until the very end .  the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events  and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight .  unfortunately  unlike  the usual suspects   we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening  whether it be true or false .  however  this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent .  the game is told completely from its main characters point of view .  nicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman .  he lives alone in his giant mansion  divorced from his wife elizabeth  and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at  in the same mansion .  for his 48th birthday  conrad ( sean penn )  the rebel of the family  gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services .    it will make your life fun again   his brother promises .  as skeptical as nicholas is  he is somewhat intrigued  and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates .  seeing a billboard in an office  he decides to visit the mysterious company .  jim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process  which consists of psych-tests  physicals  emotional responses  and other mind games .    each game is suited to each persons emotional and psychological needs   explains feingold .  one day  nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests .  even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up  he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company .  what he doesnt realize is that the game has already begun .  the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas way .  how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive .  the detail involved in finchers shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them .  with  seven   fincher had almost every single shot mean something .  he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to .  compared to  seven   though  the game is light and comical .  because of this films sense of humor and self-awareness  nothing can be taken quite seriously .  so dont try to make much sense of what goes on in the game  because it doesnt want you to .  what does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear .  if taken as it is  the games ending makes complete sense .  but if you try and critique every minute detail  then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility .  perhaps that is the reason i docked the film .  while trying to remain realistic and plausible  the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen .  we dont really care if douglas character lives or not because it isnt believable .  the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously  but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is  you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller .  michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas .  douglas has played lonely businessmen before  but here he adds another level to his performance .  his character  who is normally level-headed and relies on facts  is forced to trust nobody .  can he believe the waitress he bumped into ?  what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ?  douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well  and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his  falling down  persona ) .  the supporting cast is essential in this film  and casting was critical .  sean penn is always good  and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas brother .  deborah kara unger ( from  crash  ) is the waitress he bumps into  and her performance is extremely good .  in fact  she almost steals the film from douglas .  james rebhorn portrays his character very well  and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas predicament .  another good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from  shine  ) as the book editor .  but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game  he not only commands this cast  but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life .  the game is rated r for language  violence  some gore  and some nudity and drugs .  what is essential for this film to work is the writing .  john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue  and some very funny moments .  this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects did .  however  the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot .  and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen  you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this years best films . 
originally launched in 1978  this popular film was re-introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers .  based on the mighty successful musical from broadway  grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2 ( 6 . 5/10 )   starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles .  plot : high-school musical set in the 1950s showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia .  the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song  dance and humour .  critique : fun-loving  energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler .  this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950s  with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers .  admittedly  i am somewhat biased in this opinion  since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth ( grease was one of schmoes first big-screen experiences  and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble-gum card collection )  and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time .  but apart from the nostalgic vibe  i was still extremely impressed by this film  as it continued to amuse me  despite my previous dozen or so viewings .  this film took john travolta from a dim-witted  sweathog  on tvs welcome back kotter  and transformed him into a movie-star of spectacular proportions ( saturday night fever ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity ) .  unfortunately for the rest of the cast  his popularity was not terribly contagious  despite their effective showings in this classic movie .  on the down side  some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off ( like when sandy sings about  drinking lemonade  and  staying out until 10  with danny in  summer nights  )  and the plot isnt exactly the most elaborate story-line ever created  but despite these small reservations  this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time ( and believe me . . . i  am not a fan of the musicals ! ! ) .  make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player  as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the films absolute highlights .  and dont forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards  so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever youre feeling a little blue .  little known facts : henry winkler  of tvs happy days fonzie fame  turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career .  both travolta and conaway were smitten by newton-john during the filming of this picture .  conaway eventually bowed out of the woo-fest  and married newton-johns sister a year later ( divorced after five years ) . 
set in the late 80s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie  less than zero )  american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie  genre  that ellis helped to create .  christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman  a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues .  it seems that bateman is a serial killer and  unfortunately for his contemporaries  his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip .  as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies  his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel .  i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school .  i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it .  as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out  but i soon forgot about the novel and didnt end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore .  i picked it up and read it  but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers .  the movie has a similar effect  but at least its less cryptic than ellis novel .  for once  a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on .  both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout .  the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in batemans impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does .  as a result  the film is immensely more entertaining .  lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smiths catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference .  screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it .  some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17  mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women  and initial reports said the film was unwatchable .  thankfully  it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger  longer & uncut .  side note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of batemans who  after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute  proclaims that shes not a lesbian nor has any interest in it .  the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian .  its a subtle in-joke and its one i found to be pretty humorous .  despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon )  most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos .  the real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman .  whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters .  i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman  but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being .  to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that hes as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger .  one sequence in particular  involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song  hip to be square  right before burying an axe in a co-workers head  features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film .  side note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis  hip to be square  and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film  dont expect to see them on the soundtrack release .  huey lewis expressly requested that his song  featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of  stuck in the middle with you  in reservoir dogs )  not be included on any soundtrack release .  im assuming that collins requested the same .  on a similar note  whitney houstons cover of  the greatest love of all  is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isnt the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source .  apparently  houston wasnt as open about the use of her song as the others were .  a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the films release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film .  dont look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more .  several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but im still undecided .  there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops  old ladies  and cleaning staff with equal gusto .  the scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example  bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) .  i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there  but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence  though comic  throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) .  other than the few flaws i have mentioned  american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in batemans reality ) .  i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such .  it may not change anyones life  but it will certainly have an effect .  i know i will certainly hear  hip to be square  in a different context the next time i hear it .

ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ?  you remember  he was the title character in that 70s sitcom   welcome back kotter .   always trying to help out the sweathogs  frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman  ever wary of his wifes tuna casserole .    so   you ask   where is he now ?   mr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker .  thats right .  im not sure if its his main source of income  but from what ive heard  the guy occasionally comes away with $20  000 at a time .  and there you were  thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater .  you silly goose .  well  gabe kaplan isnt in the movie rounders  nor is the film about the actor come gamblers life .  but rounders is about poker  and gabe plays poker  and i thought that was kind of a neat connection .  sorry about the segue  or lack thereof .  matt damon plays mike mcdermott  a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker .  hes been playing for a while  and more than being proficient  he has caught the bug .  he goes to all the underground games in new york city  knows the regulars  and knows how to win .  in the beginning of the film  hes built up a nice thirty grand nest egg  which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play .  mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich )  an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia .  mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker  but instead he loses it all in a single hand .  months later  hes paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck .  when mikes best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students  he wants to pick up right were they left off  working as a team to part others with their betting cash .  although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student  jo ( gretchen mol )  worm connives mike into playing once more  and mike  bitten again by the bug  slides down that slippery slope  risking his relationship  education  and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life .  to make a film about gambling  a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters .  this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth .  rounders  however  seems to go more for the latter than the former .  the card clubs mike and worm frequent arent very glamorous at all .  theres a basement  a lodge with elk heads on the wall  a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots .  except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city  the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table .  the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it .  were given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations  and good actors to play them .  matt damon is very natural as mike  who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school  and answering what may be his true calling  playing professional poker .  ed nortons worm is truly a worm  always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what theyre worth .  john turturro  who amazes me with his acting range  tones it down in this film by playing joey knish  a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments .  hes both a friend and mentor to mike  and turturros low-key performance is totally convincing  just as john malkovichs heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself .  martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mikes law professors  abe petrovsky .  while landau slips well into the role  his character  spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to ones self  facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending .  perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent  however  is gretchen mol who just didnt seem to have much presence on screen .  shes a genuine peach to look at  kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldnt be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world )  but her delivered lines seemed very flat  and i found myself looking for matt damons reactions instead .  a good thing about rounders is that it doesnt get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it cant find time for humor .  the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going  such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next  in widely different locales .  one game in a cigar club had me in stitches .    i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper   says one of the players  clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other .  i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys .  with all the poker being played  rounders had the potential to be very confusing .  you might think you know a lot about poker  but think again .  luckily  were given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain whats going on .  the narrations are more informative than intrusive  and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do .  its nice that as the characters develop  so does our comprehension of their world .  as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker  rounders delivers in spades .  wait !  as a film about the culture of cards  rounders is an ace .  hang on !  packed with great acting and great characters  rounders is a full house .  okay  i guess thats enough .  oh  by the way  if you ever want to get into a game with ol gabe kaplan  be sure to bring a note from epsteins mother . 
did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet ?  or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial ?  i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher  ms . carey .  but after seeing this movie  they may have confirmed my suspicions .  as the story goes  at any time  there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth .  the men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens  guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens  and secret service to the stars .  based in new york city ( where weird is the norm )  the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed .  but to enforce the laws of earth  the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast .  they carry other-worldly technology to erase peoples short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action .  and their best leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids .  little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v . evil going on in the depths of space .  one of the aliens-as-human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious .  it holds the key  literally  to universal peace .  a giant cockroach-like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this key .  in the wrong alien hands ( flippers ?  mandibles ?  tentacles ? )  it can be used as a weapon .  therefore  it must be recovered and returned to its rightful owners .  otherwise  to ensure universal safety  earth will be destroyed  along with the key .  now  its the mib who must prevent this catastrophe .  the mib agents on the case are  k   played by tommy lee jones .  he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore .  the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes .  he is accompanied by a flippant rookie   j   played by will smith .  but  despite this shoot-em-up  protect-earth-from-destruction premise  this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie .  and  this isnt an independence day knockoff .  rather  this is a stylishly offbeat sci-fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies ? that there are real aliens that live here  and that the government does its darndest to cover them up .  but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe  there must be some kind of earth-hangs-in-the-balance scenario .  yet  this movie is very appealing .  the abundance of wierdness ( talking aliens  pee-wee atomizers  a mortician who lives for her work  and lots of yucky bugs and slime-splattering galore )  is played straight  like as if this were normal ( of course  we are in nyc ) .  it gives it a deadpan feel  which makes it all the more funnier and odder .  jones plays the venerable seen-it-all agent with seriousness and maturity .  smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones straight man routine .  they click like dorothys ruby red shoes .  the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld ( the addams family ) .  this guy has a knack for gothic comedy  and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen .  and  an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors .  the story moves well  and before you know it  the end credits are already rolling !  the result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs  aaaahhhs and wows .  let the men in black protect and color your world . 
i feel no hesitation in saying that  theres something about mary  is the best film that i will see all year .  from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture  there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 .  it is that good of a film .  when gene siskel said this about  fargo  only a few months into 96  i dismissed the notion as ridiculous .  how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ?  but after seeing the farrellys hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork  i now know what siskel was talking about .  once in a ( very great ) while  a film comes along that is so daring  so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end  you just want to stand up and cheer .  and you know  at that instant  that you have just experienced something very special .  now for the shocker ;  mary  is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed (  pink flamingos  obviously notwithstanding ) .  the movie is so rude and  i guess  inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them  so i could warn the about what they were in for ) .  forget  blazing saddles    animal house  and even the former king of gross-out comedy   monty pythons meaning of life  ; they were all only preludes to the farrellys assault on the senses .  in fact  this may even be the funniest film ive ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is  monty python and the holy grail  )  and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade .  but as funny as it is  something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of  mary  ; it has a huge heart .  you see  the farrellys are truly gifted filmmakers .  they dont just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) .  they also  very wisely  add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses .  its funny  though .  if you just look at an outline of the story  it seems kind of contrived and predictable .  but believe me  it is anything but .  ben stiller plays ted  a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe  mary ( cameron diaz ) .  after he sticks up for her retarded brother  warren ( w .  early brown - the cameraman  believe it or not  from  scream  )  his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom .  in one of the films funniest scenes  something goes wrong ( i wont ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again .  jump to the present .  after years of self-loathing  ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school .  healy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself .  admittingly  the basic story line leaves a little to be desired .  after all  with a not-really-all-that-funny premise  how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ?  somehow  the farrellys pull it off .  the performances here are also right on target .  as ted  stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating  as he would normally be  but very lovable .  and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons  but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as marys brother .  no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here .  i know he wont be nominated  but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february .  as good as the actors are  though  its the directors movie all the way .  i guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year  you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielbergs wwii epic  saving private ryan  .  and yes  that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting .  but which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they cant breath for minutes at a time ?  ill let you decide that one for yourself  but this critic is sticking to his guns .  there is just something about  mary  . 
  id rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell   earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher .  with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister  hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story .  he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american  and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation .  from elmer gantry on  we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church .  well  think again  for the apostle  which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade  does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister  and by implication all  the rest of organized religion .  instead it gives us a highly devout man  who certainly has his foibles  but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god .  and arguably just as surprising  the good-spirited film is no comedy  even if it does have humorous moments .  instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures .  when in the privacy of his attic  robert duvall  as texas preacher euliss  sonny  dewey  argues sternly with his lord  the scene shares a kinship with emily watsons character crying out for her god in breaking the wavess most powerful scene .  the body of the story starts with sonnys coming upon an horrific auto accident  which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters .  with his well worn bible in hand  sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accidents dying victims .  the scowling police officer orders him to go away  and  after he has tried to work his miracles  sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lords work .  robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the films director  writer  executive producer  and chief financier .  rarely has a movie been such a labor of love .  with a white suit  peach-colored shirt and tie  and dark sunglasses  sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher .  duvall has every movement down pat .  even when he is walking down the street  the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy .  he dances and claps all the way .  sonnys churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators  but his rhetoric is always competitive .    i may be on the devils hit-list  but im on gods mailing list   he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent .  and they lap it up .  people jump up  scream   praise the lord !   and mean it .  the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable .  but sonny is no saint .  it turns out that he has a wandering eye  which angers his wife jessie  played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett .  jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the churchs youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonnys church  leaving him unemployed .  sonny  letting his temper get the best of him  does something foolish  which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever .  the bulk of the film occurs in a small  predominately black church in louisiana  which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church (  one way road to heaven : holiness temple  ) with an enthusiastic flock .  in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church .  he asks his members to tithe  but he gives all of his money .  and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks .  a man who cant stand to be still  he tells one of his friends   i quit school because i didnt like recess .   in his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson )  who  like him  has a family that she hasnt seen in a while .  his romance with the separated woman  like the rest of the film  doesnt follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies .  billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker .  his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of shows many surprising scenes  again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take .  although it probably couldnt have ended any other way  the movie does wrap things up nicely .  and dont miss the sweet epilogue during the films closing credits .  a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film .  the apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 .  it is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up . 
one of the best movies ive ever seen .  id heard extremely good things about this movie  and though the previews didnt really intrigue that much  it was a movie id been anticipating for a few months now .  for some reason im not sure of - this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u . s . it was a definite hit with the critics  but didnt exactly set any box office records .  after viewing this incredibly well directed  written and acted movie  i cant help but wonder - why ?  the strength of this film is its gritty realism .  the main characters are all human with individual flaws  no stereo-type hollywood heroes .  you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life  but that is what makes it so real .  i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller  but i was mistaken .  even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase .  and the ending . . . . . . whoa .  ive never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly .  the three male leads - guy pearce  kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific .  the best actor oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue  but there is one problem there .  how could they have chosen between these three actors ?  there is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two .  its impossible .  kim bassingers performance is also a revelation .  id never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was  well . . . whats the word - a twinky ?  that impression has changed  as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly .  the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding .  no cardboard characters here .  the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences .  pearces interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant .  i really cant fault this movie at all .  i was so glad to see fellow australians pearce and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie .  i had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films  but had not seen much of guy pearce .  i intend to change this next time i visit the video store : ) 
this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 .  whether it was the meddling of studio executives  or the work of writer/director james cameron himself  the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed .  the main problem was fairly simple : the films climax was unworthy of its build-up .  someone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed  because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition .  now available on video  it seems timely to re-evaluate what  in its newly revamped state  is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two  alien and close encounters of third kind .  the plot is thus .  we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard-nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon-to-be-divorced husband bud ( ed harris ) .  the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u . s . nuclear submarine .  requiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench  three navy divers arrive to command the operation  led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn ) .  but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever theyre dealing with  as she memorably puts it   arent speaking russian  .  meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and  even worse  a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u . s . navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions .  this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig  with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them .  the human drama is often riveting  with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in camerons aliens .  the stunts  hardware  special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding .  and so they should be : camerons technical credentials are well established .  but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss .  the abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects .  one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay  a relationship at times touching  at others incredibly intense and volatile .  the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the films end  when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war .  with the inclusion of these startling scenes  the storys climax is now given real weight .  why on earth were they left out of the original ?  this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible .  so then  we have 25 minutes of additional footage thats turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent .  i say  quite  because some flaws do remain .  the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new  some old - that may well have you reaching for the barf bag .  nonetheless  the abyss : special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james camerons greatest achievements  alongside aliens and terminator 2 . see it and be moved  gripped and spellbound . 
i have a soft spot in my heart for pure  amoral sleaze .  i liked showgirls ( there  i said it ) .  i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz  sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash .  wild things is the best sleazy film ive ever seen .  its filled with great performances  graphic sex  three-way sex  rape charges  double-crosses  plot twists  genitalia of all genders  graphic violence  death  witty humor  and  best of all  denise richards .  criticizing this film for being disgusting  raucous  and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing  or titanic for being lofty and epic .  wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors  but i dont just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies .  i must admit up-front  however  that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal .  i imagine that this shows .  its hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldnt be known .  i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer  but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here .  ill just say that the film takes place in blue bay  a rich little town in florida .  in blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon )  a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students  kelly van ryan ( denise richards )  and suzie toller ( neve campbell ) .  kellys mother  sandra ( theresa russell )  immediately presses charges .  all of this happens fairly early in the film .  and right up until this point  i had the whole film predicted .  i was wrong  though  and every time i was proven wrong  i was shocked .  wild things isnt even remotely plausible  but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless  and often invited  just for kicks .  i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers .  id give the preview four stars .  it made me want to see the movie so much that ive been waiting for it anxiously ever since .  over the past few weeks though  i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview ( see independence day ) ; thankfully  i was proven wrong .  the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film  but it doesnt give away any of the secrets .  but im not here to talk about the preview .  im here to talk about denise richards .  now  i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers  but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene shes in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can .  of course  this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes . . . and  flawless body . . . but  i thought she did a great job acting  too ( stop laughing ) .  no  richards is truly a find--she is talented  and always convincing in this film .  this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future .  the other actors are good  too .  dillon is as suave as ever ( its nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in & out ) .  bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer .  neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them  though i wont pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex .  for a plot like this to work  all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived .  thats okay  because director john mcnaughton knows that hes making a self-consciously wicked film .  each scene--even the three-way sex scene--is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton  and the result is a sleaze-fest thats too smart to resist .  there isnt an inconsistent moment in wild things : every bit of it is alluring garbage  so trashy its funny  and so entertaining its painful .  i loved it . 
tarzan chadz = good ) 1999  g  90 minutes [1 hour  30 minutes] [animated - adventure/drama] starring the voices of : tony goldwyn ( tarzan )  minnie driver ( jane porter )  lance henriksen ( kerchak )  brian blessed ( clayton ) ; written by tab murphy  bob tzudiker  noni white ; produced by bonnie arnold ; directed by chris buck  kevin lima ; based on the story `tarzan of the apes and characters created by edgar rice burroughs .  seen july 4  1999 at 7 : 15 p . m . at crossgates cinemas 18 ( guilderland  ny )  theater #9  by myself for free using my hoyts season pass .  [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound  picture and seats]  title : `tarzan beautiful to look at  easy to follow .  review : disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story .  the basic premise is the same as every other `tarzan story : a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding ( or even noticing ) that hes human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends .  the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala ( voiced by glen close )  a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism .  her mate  kerchak ( henriksen )  is a mean  conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzans extended family .  he refuses to acknowledge tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz during the childhood scenes ) as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous  wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts .  i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun and its funny how the adults fail to comprehend this .  later  as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full-grown man ( voiced by goldwyn )  he is encounter by a party of three humans from england : jane porter ( driver )  a beautiful woman who is something of a zoologist and an artist  her father prof . archimedes q . porter ( voiced by nigel hawthorne ) who is also a scientist ; and their slick and cunning  yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton ( blessed ) .  its easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesnt seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for childrens enjoyment .  sure theres a lot of cliche stuff here  like claytons smugness and diabolical manipulation of tarzan and jane ; the goofy supporting characters ( voiced by rosie odonnell [in full brooklyn accent ! ] and wayne knight - `hello newman !  ) .  theres also a lot of fun action such as tarzans swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks .  its just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks ( those mcdonalds commercials really prove this point ) .  ultimately  you get exactly out of `tarzan what you expect . . .  and i mean that as a compliment  so have high expectations .  pros : animation and sound are a feast for the senses  story is lighthearted  breezy and not dumbed-down  no stupid sing-along songs to get stuck in your head .  cons : surprisingly violent  should have been rated pg .  young children may not understand some of the more adult themes ( parents  be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way ) .  running time is a bit short .  would you recommend this to friends ?  not to my friends  but to the movie-going public i would .  score : or with no 0 rating ) . 
ive always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable - death and taxes .  oddly  ive never given much thought to either of the two .  maybe if i did  at least id stop getting collection notices from uncle sam .  yes  let me make a resolution to devote myself to better record keeping  hold on to all my receipts  and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake-free and will keep me from incurring penalties .  it seems that the issue of death may not be so different  at least envisioned here in this film .  as this tender love story goes  if you do good things and have a clear conscience when you die  you ascend to a place of great peace and beauty .  the dreams  wishes  and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true .  for those who die with a burdened soul  however  they wind up in that other place .  chris and annie ( a winsome robin williams and a radiant annabella sciorra ) seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has to offer .  their love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable .  but tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annies happiness .  and when chris dies after a terrible car accident  she commits suicide - a tortured soul who blames herself .  despair is perhaps the greatest sin  and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity .  chris  on the other hand  has made it to heaven  and upon learning of annies fate  he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare .  this film brims with imagination  containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell .  it seems that heaven and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares .  its shape and look is as infinite as our imagination .  as chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous  he also begins to learn more about himself .  certain questions baffle him at first .  why does his home in heaven ooze with paint ?  what is the significance of the asian stewardess ?  why does he have an all-too-willing guide ( cuba gooding  jr . ) to help him find annie ?  but as he slowly begins to realize the answers  it makes him stronger and gives him a greater chance to save annie .    dreams  is both visually and tellingly beautiful .  alas  i have one regret .  the movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed  but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying .  it seemed as if it was racing to some kind of great finish  but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments .  however  your eyes will still well up with tears and youll find lots to savor .  the storytelling is purposeful and well constructed .  the journey is imaginative .  and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film . 
it was a crazy time in france  what with the french revolution right around the corner .  king louis xv would soon die  and his son would become king louis xvi .  such is the setting for beaumarchais : the scoundrel about the controversial playwright  spy and playboy pierre-augustin caron de beaumarchais .  beaumarchais was the author of the plays   the barber of seville  and  the marriage of figaro .   today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas  but  back in 1773 when the movie takes place  they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once .  the movie beaumarchais : the scoundrel takes a light-hearted approach to its subject  resulting in an inviting motion picture .  one of frances most expensive productions ever  the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year .  now in theatrical release in the united states  it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story .  the secret of the films success  other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzacs costumes  has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais .  with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile  he mesmerizes the camera and the audience .  his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning .  in a land where court intrigue determines ones destiny  constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy .  as our story starts  we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship .  into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight .  beaumarchais  who has been having an affair with the mans wife  makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided .  that over with  the fight is on .  with luchinis charisma  it is hard to root for anyone other than him .  audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert  in which he played the attorney .  although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin  played by manuel blanc  he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style .  michael epps warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jean-marc kerdelhues lush but realistic looking sets .  jean-claude petits music  especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos  make for an enchanting time at the movies .  director jean-claude brisville  who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro  fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which  according to the press notes  was just a series of historic vignettes .  the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie  but the actors smooth it over with their good-hearted style .  typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a rotund benjamin franklin appears in a large pot of hot water  taking his bath .  one episode has beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man .  another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the american revolution .  all of this may sound like a dull historical drama  but it is anything but .  the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts .  the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marie-therese  the real love of beaumarchaiss life .  but he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him .  still  with his beguiling smile  one can never quite be sure if you should trust him .  the movie  on the other hand  can be trusted to deliver a high old time .  beaumarchais : the scoundrel runs 1 : 41 .  it is in french with english subtitles .  the film is not rated but would be an r for some nudity and sex  and should be fine for most teenagers . 
what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker .  the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis !  i can hear batfans everywhere protesting :  first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman  and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! !   and  indeed  this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play .  nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding  oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman .  nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the 60s tv series ) .  on one hand  nicholsons joker is extremely funny .  his murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film .  but on the other hand  his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind .  the jokers cruelty and demented  diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister .  this guy is off his rocker  and he not only knows it  he flaunts it !  but enough about nicholson as the joker : im sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman .  like many  i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader .  but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting !  keaton delivers .  he is convincing as the tormented millionaire  bruce wayne  and beneath his hard  black body armor  he is mysterious and formidable as the batman .  even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character  keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city .  visually  batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team .  the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak  gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as  the dark knight returns  and  the killing joke .   burtons film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen .  the sets  costumes  and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations .  nicholson isnt joking when he boasts   wait till they get a load of me !   his grimacing smile  green hair  and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous .  keatons wardrobe is equally appropriate .  batmans cape  mask  and body armor make him look threatening  frightening  and invincible bringing to mind not adam wests campy costume in the tv series but peter weirs outfit in robocop .  production designer anton fursts sets are a wonder .  gotham city is dark and foreboding  almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york .  the batcave is cold  bare  and desolate .  the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption .  the movies gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold .  the plot  on the other hand  is not as rousing .  the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting .  it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear .  batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology  but it fails to give us enough of either one .  as i mentioned earlier  the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker  but it never fully establishes batmans psychological motives and underpinnings .  in terms of action  batman is not as thrilling as you might expect .  burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story .  more than anything  batman is a mood film .  while batman may not completely absorb and excite you  it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books .  thanks to its distinctive look  the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world . 
casting  doogie howser  star neil patrick harris as mind-reading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of  starship troopers   a hugely entertaining  mega-budgeted sci-fi yarn directed by paul verhoeven  whos making quite a recovery from his 1995 g-string epic  showgirls .   sure   starship troopers  qualifies as cinematic junk food  but thats forgivable when the junk food is this tasty .  everyone needs a high-calorie change-of-pace from falls onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait  and  troopers  does the job admirably despite its flaws .  for its first hour   starship troopers  plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of  saved by the bell  and  g . i .  jane .   in the distant years ahead  high school grad johnny rico ( casper van dien ) signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot  so the couple is broken up .  but theres temptation awaiting both of them -- johnnys is in the form of an old friend ( dina meyer ) also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush  while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor ( patrick muldoon ) .  personal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final 65 minutes  when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america  killing johnnys parents and destroying his home .  our weakening  lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry  and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens home planet  where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good .  but the enemy is far smarter  more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for  and after an initial walloping  they must re-examine their strategy .  the exposition -- played like a futuristic soap opera -- is silly  but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans .  once we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous ( but never boring ) training sessions   starship troopers  really kicks into high gear .  its last half is all gruesomely violent action -- a fury of severed limbs  decapitations  disembowelments  brain removal  explosions and other jolt-inducers that are really going to please the 13- and 14-year-old boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly r-rated show .  the creature design and special effects are amazing as expected  and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic  imaginative high point .  its nice to see intergalactic beasties that arent too derivative of the titular menace from  alien .   these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights  especially the arachnids  a spider-scorpion-crab combo thats all sharp talons and even sharper legs .  they attack in packs of hundreds  and its a funny  scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl  jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined  gooey mess .  it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind ( ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot ) ; these sequences of insect warfare are numerous  bloody and immensely satisfying .  the occasional dramatic moments -- one cast members death  the final resolution to johnnys love triangle -- are botched  a testament to how  starship troopers  fails to create any strong  outstanding characters .  these bland ken-and-barbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arms length  but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la  star wars   where even the slightest aliens had definite personality .  the acting is decent ( but never spectacular ) ; most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory -- smallish roles on  beverly hills 90210  and/or  melrose place  -- and it occasionally shows .  van dien  for example  is limited but perfectly likeable .  in smaller parts are the afore-mentioned neil patrick harris as johnnys best friend and jake busey ( garys son ) as johnnys sidekick ; the latter excels at playing creeps ( see  the frighteners  or  contact  ) but seems off-kilter as a second banana .    starship troopers  is based on the novel by robert heinlein  a sci-fi writer who hasnt exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with 1994s howler  the puppet masters .   but the overall familiarity to the  alien  trilogy -- and the promise of great gobs of gore -- could act as a crowd-drawer .  its own possible influence  however  might well work against it when the franchise continuation  alien : resurrection  opens in a few weeks .  we will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall . 
historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s .  for many critics  scholars and  most importantly  film producers  it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects .  but in 1995  same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago  there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor  producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre .  and  same as in the case of dances with wolves  he was awarded for his effort with  oscars  .  the name of the film was braveheart  and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson .  the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) .  in his time  english king edward i  longshanks  ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles  including scotland  whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by  ius primae noctis  and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights .  although english had killed his father many years ago  young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesnt care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) .  murrons death changes that and wallace takes arms and  together with small but dedicated band of followers  begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country .  through time  more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallaces rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge .  but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves  especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen )  who wouldnt like to have a simple commoner as a national leader .  braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson  so it wouldnt be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann .  however  even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre .  the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism .  while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles  splendid costumes and knights in shining armour  gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard  short and brutish .  this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle  where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details  never seen since verhoevens ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood .  compared with this naturalistic approach  most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays .  braveheart also employs humour at the right places  not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences  but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere  so different from previous historical epics .  what makes braveheart  larger than life  is his protagonist .  mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and  as a result  character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero .  wallace is more than superior to his enemies  both physically and mentally  yet he is able to show his sensitive  more vulnerable side .  naturally  when the character is based on epic poems  most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) .  however  even those who dont particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace  especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child .  because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended  and final scenes arent as effective as they should be .  mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful  and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors .  most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan  whose cold  calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema .  brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boormans general ) is also very good as wallaces trusted companion  as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol .  david oharra is very entertaining as wallaces irish ally  and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce .  women in this film have rather thankless roles  especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess .  catherine mccormack as wallaces wife was more interesting  but she was eliminated from the picture early on .  from the technical point of view  the film is also very good .  photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen .  on the other hand  the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times .  although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike  braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism .  the main reason for that was the fact that gibson  among many historical facts  chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of  longshank  s son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) .  he is not only presented as a villain  but also as one of the less competent in villains camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in  politically correct  hollywood .  to make things even more obvious  good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals .  however  although the message of this film might look right-wing  it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century .  according to that ideology  oppressed classes ( workers  peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and  as such  they are more radical  less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand  privileged classes ( aristocracy  bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges .  this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety .  in the end  whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic  braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre . 
if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child  would you do it ?    gattaca  is a film which presents a future where society has answered  yes  to this question  but then ponders if this was actually the right decision .    gattaca  came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature  the lovable dolly the sheep  and with this in mind  the film only becomes more frightening .  the way the realm of genetics is heading  it may only take a couple decades until the future  gattaca  presents becomes true .  contrary to the misleading trailers   gattaca  is not a sci-fi thriller  in the way that theres lots of murder  hitchcockian suspense  and chase scenes .  this is a quiet  sad film about intelligent theories .  in fact  the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter whos novel  brave new world  featured genetically engineered children ) .  its a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia  which is exactly what  gattaca  presents . . . and the main reason i dug it so much .  the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke )  a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems  and a prospected life span of around 30 years .  as a child  he was put down because of the threats of genetics  while his younger genetically perfect brother  anton ( loren dean )  was promised whatever his heart desired .  vincent yearns to be an astronaut  but when he gets a job at a giant space company  its as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! ) .  but one day  he finds out that its probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something )  german (  wings   tony shalhoub  who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in 97 :  men in black    a life less ordinary  . . . )  whos client is a genetically perfect man  jerome morrow ( jude law )  who has unfortunately been crippled .  fortunately  though  theres no record of the accident  and hes willing to give someone else his life .  since vincent looks a bit like him . . .  after a couple alterations ( some minor  some really major )  he has donned the life of jerome  and is doing his job .  there  he meets a genetically imperfect woman  irene ( uma thurman  whos genetically perfect in real life anyway  hee hee )  and the two begin a kind of relationship  albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a mans stats are .  however  a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed  and one of vincent/jeromes eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi-wily inspector  hugo  ( alan arkin )  and none other than vincents long lost brother  anton  who hasnt seen him since they were teenagers .  we know vincent/jerome didnt do it  but with his older picture being posted everywhere  not only vincent/jeromes in trouble  but also the real jerome  whos as much in it as he is .  however  there isnt many big suspense set pieces  which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in  the film would lose its message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson .  the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin .  while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening  there are no big distractions from the point of the film  much to the dismay of commercial audiences .  what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created .  irene has no real spunk in her life  and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people .  and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man  claiming that his accident was really no accident .  what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that  and the ending is shocking as its a definite work of dystopian propaganda  but doesnt have the down ending of other works of this kind .  the production design of this film is probably the best ive seen this year : its stunning  very pleasing to the eye  but still very cold .  since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement  the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity  and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery .  and the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam-esque feel to it  showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie-like life .  the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy .  the acting from everyone is great  with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance  and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway ( interesting pointless fact : uma and ethan started dating after this film  and currently she is pregnant with his child ) .  but the best performance belongs to jude law  who steals every scene hes in  and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden .  i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child  but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something im not sure of .    gattaca  warns us not to go any farther  chiefly because well create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy  and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are .  and when i see a possible future featuring a 12-fingered piano player  well folks  that just creeps me out . 
in one scene from  the people vs .  larry flynt   the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self-staged free speech rally .  as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him  flynt strides confidently across the stage  delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity .  the spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in  patton  where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag .  both scenes were stirring  larger than life  richly entertaining  and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies .  overall  that sums up  the people vs .  larry flynt .   the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which  despite being based on fact  feels like a big  phony hollywood movie .  the son of a kentucky moonshiner  flynt ( woody harrelson ) ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati .  there he met althea leasure ( courtney love )  a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life .  to bolster interest in his clubs  he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine .  flynt  along with the magazines rag-tag management team  headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woodys real-life brother  steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson )  viewed playboy magazine with contempt .  they mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos  striving to keep hustler focused on  what guys really want   explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm  and extremely crude humor .  the films prime example of hustlers attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy  giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynts  naughtiness .   director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazines frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation  racism  and endless scatological cartoons .  flynts rag labored in well-deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis  which brought the magazine international attention  big money and the attention of conservatives .  an obscenity bust followed  the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law .  lawyer alan isaacman ( edward norton ) enters the scene  hired by flynts wife .  norton  an exceptional actor  is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynts increasingly childish and bizarre behavior .  in court  we meet the sputtering conservatives  headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating ( james cromwell . )  as keating blathers about flynts immorality  the camera slowly moves in for a close-up of his name tag  inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating  who was later convicted in a $2 billion s&l fraud .  flynts other prime foe is rev . jerry falwell  who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse .  tragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would-be assassin  leaving him paralyzed from the waist down .  a dark period follows  as flynt and leasure hole up in an l . a . suite  strung out on pain killers .  flynt eventually kicks drugs  but leasure succumbs to addiction  and later  aids .  after watch falwell on tv  describing aids as a punishment from god  flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court  leading to the films climactic courtroom scene .    the people vs  larry flynt  is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt .    if theyll protect a scumbag like me  then theyll protect all of you   declared flynt .  hes right  of course  but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons .  he also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt .  harrelson is an attractive  charismatic man  and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero .  even a cursory look at the real flynt  who is making the talk show circuit  and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene  shows a bloated  morose and bitter man .  an accurate portrayal of flynt would have made a more difficult film to watch  but a richer one .  despite its flaws   flynt  is a fast moving  rousing movie with some terrific acting  especially by courtney love  whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod .  the story may be candy-coated  but its still delicious candy . 
we all know the fate of  childs play   which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell .  with the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be  bride of chucky  - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend  which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five )  its kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original  a task which is a retread for some  and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about .  alas  the original  childs play  actually isnt that bad .  even seeing it in the tiny  claustrophobic  and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasnt the horribly dull experience i thought it would be  not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you dont believe me  try and watch this flick by yourself one day )  but because as a whole  this isnt a bad movie .  its not great  but it does have two things that many horror films like this one dont have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise  and 2 ) a sense of humor  both which save this from horror hell  which is precisely where  say   i know what you did last summer  has recently gone .  the premise of  childs play  is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? )  and before he dies  utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kids doll called chucky  a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kids doll ive ever seen .  the next day  a bum whos stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks )  who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday .  of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll  but certain twists come up .  like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll  that being andy .  and soon enough  chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun  and people are discovering that chucky isnt just a kiddie doll one by one .  the idea is a neat one  ripe for lots of comic terror  and luckily it utlizes a lot of that .  it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive  they tell people about it  but when he tries to prove themselves  chucky does nothing  and everyone thinks theyre crazy .  it plays with this  as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life  and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments .  even if theres an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise  goes to investigate it  and finds nothing  but wait for the kicker a second later ! )   theres also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat  and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes  leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience .  the ending is rather fun  as well  albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings  maybe five )  and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up  making them easier to sympathize with .  if theres one horrible thing about many horror films  its that the protagonists are morons who you cant help but shout obscenities at  and for the most part   childs play  steers away from that .  and most of all  the chucky character is a good one  not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look !  that dolls moving on its own ! )  but because hes a generally scary character .  if theres anything really wrong with  childs play   its that its too trite and has too less self esteem .  at almost 90 minutes   childs play  features way too less to be a real classic of horror .  it throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it werent for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll .  if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting  it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism  which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which  isnt necessarily a bad thing .  as such   childs play  is content to be just the short  typical horror film  but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi-campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short  typical horror film . 
director : penelope spheeris ( decline of western civilization ii - the : metal years  dudes  & suburbia )  cast : mike myers ( wayne campbell )  dana carvey ( garth algar )  : rob lowe ( benjamin oliver )  tia carrere ( cassandra )  summary : wayne and garth have a public access show called  waynes : world .   the show is a underground hit  until benjamin : oliver comes onto the scene .  benjamin wants to turn the : show into a big hit nationwide  possibly destroying the : essence of  waynes world  in the process .  [expectations - medium]  long review ===========  i must admit being a bit reluctant going into this film .  i didnt believe that they ( mike myers and dana carvey ) could hold it up for an hour and a half  i figured that perhaps the first half-hour would be great  and the rest would be  fluff .   however  i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film  with the exception of the ending .   ( which i wont discuss for obvious reasons  but its not * that * bad . )  story : the plot was quite thin  but it really wasnt that noticeable  because of the rapid-fire jokes that myers wrote in .  alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots !  in being very  parodyish .    ( okay  bad term . )  extremely witty throughout  although ( as in hot shots ) it got a bit repetitive in the middle .  acting : as in many comedies  the acting isnt really * that * important .  however  myers turns in a good performance as wayne  playing the character perfectly  ( although i still liked him better back on much music  in a more  canadian  type of mode . )  carvey is okay as garth  but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne .  tia carrere is mediocre as cassandra  playing it very stilted .  lowe is fine as ben oliver  but is nothing to write home about .  without a doubt  this movie is mike myers all the way .  direction : spheeris is a classic  music  movie director  making dudes  and decline of western civilization ii -- the metal years .   ( she also directed the boys next door  which is different  to say the least . )  she is very capable  knows how direct a comedy  the correct camera movements it instill laughs  etc . one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy .  overall : i would suggest to anyone that likes snls skits to go see this film in the theatres .  however  my personal opinion  as in most comedies  is that they work just as well on video .  you definately have to be fan of music  and all forms of media in general to enjoy this film .  without a doubt  this is the best comedy so far this year .  itll make tons o dough for everyone involved .  lets just hope they make a thousand sequels .  [sorry  i had to get the lame joke in . . .  forgive me . ] 
natural born killers is really a very simple story that  in essence  has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis  mood and degree .  both films glamorize  outlaws   in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers .  both relate the story of a couple liberated by love .  but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle  natural born killers is total and blatant .  where bonnie & clyde was social  natural born killers is psychological .  what bonnie & clyde hinted at  natural born killers confronts and explores .  what bonnie and clyde stole  mickey and mallory kill .  to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them  expressed metaphorically as killing  subdues the mysterious power this film wields .  for the most part  when mickey and mallory kill  they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily  they kill what is trying to kill them  they kill what dissembles and cowers from life  they kill what needs to be killed .  this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity .  brahma created .  vishnu preserved .  and siva destroyed  but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma .  the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate  im forced to say it for claritys sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes  that is  destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics .  your plumber  bonnie and clyde  mickey and mallory  and siva are all productive destroyers .  i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death  presently and historically  than any other phenomena .  muslims kill christians .  hindus kill muslims .  christians kill pagans .  jews kill christians  etc . you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged .  religion is an orgy of killing .  the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasnt been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable .    the state is the divine idea upon earth   hegel said  meaning it is absolute  all-powerful  ineffable  unassailable  infallible  authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh  allah  god  etc .  well  what does all this have to do with natural born killers ?  let me first say that religions of this nature  in the ideal  take the place of sex .  consider the catholic church  which in its hey-dey  took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever .  god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope  cardinals  bishops  monks  etc . they forego the one  in order to come closer to the other .  during the middle ages  when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged  the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power .   ( parenthetically  witness plato as well .  in the republic  he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime .  not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself  regularly assailing the passions . )  catholicism  as policy  attacks the passions as evil .  it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure .  masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution .  this is religion  this is authoritarianism in its essence .  as further evidence  the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters .  our culture  most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years .  we cant help but adopt  even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes  leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self .  mickey and mallory knox internalized them  too  then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other  discovered them  and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves .  it is a straightforward liberation through sex .  as some good patriarch once observed   you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on .   m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions .  they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions .    the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers   as mickey says .  as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face .  we are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is .    neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans  : even pindar  in his day  knew that much about us .  beyond the north  beyond ice  beyond death--our life  our happiness . . . .  we have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth .  who else has found it ? --the  man of today ? --  i  dont know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesnt know either the way out or the way in  --so sighs the man of today . . . .  this is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace  cowardly compromise  the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay .  this tolerance and largeur of the heart that  forgives  everything because it  understands  everything is a sirocco to us .  rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds !  as far as i can tell  this is what the movie has to say .  its alleged critique of the media is only secondary  tertiary  quaternary  subsidiary for sure .  for example wayne gayles first report ends with some gen x dude saying   if i were a mass murderer id be mickey and mallory   in his most excellent bill and ted voice .  on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical  impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes .  it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself hed be just like them  killing and destroying what deserves it .  let me exemplify what ive been saying by analyzing a scene from the film  namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant  kills him  and then castigates him for giving her  the worst fuckin head ive ever had in my life ! ! !   now  i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship  because demonstrably they didnt  and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this .  sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations  but unwilling to kill each other  since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation  they must kill in place of their lever .  its no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey .  as the attendant approached he took on mickeys character in the eyes of mallory .  she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory .  upon discovery  mallory views this as a betrayal  judges him  and commutes his sentence on someone else .  the style of the movie is a whole nother matter that i wont get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power .  let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness  barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle .  the rapid succession of all those 8mm  16mm  35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish  frenetic mood .  also  jungian archetypes abound .  these cant help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames .  some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) :  mickey to mallory :  one of these days im gonna be cummin for you   in prison  while mallory jacks mickey off .  semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come .  at the time they havent yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet .  the two of course go hand in hand .  for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs .  mickey during his marriage to mallory :  as creator of my universe  i pronounce us man and wife .   the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting  but telling  too .  it reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones .  this is what mickey means by  creator of my universe   he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes .  it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears .  scagnettis first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendants mouth .  the indian sage releasing mallorys father  who was reincarnated as a snake :  old man  go be a snake   after telling his  snake story  that ends with  bitch  you knew i was a snake .   after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare  mallory says   you killed life ! ! !   this is another telling quote because it implies they didnt see themselves as killers of life .  then what were they killing up to that time ?  in some case just those zombies faking their way through life  the living dead  as it were .  in other cases  all the anti-life forces  the cops and their parents .  the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison .  it of course symbolizes rebirth .  dr . emil reingold  as portrayed by steven wright  passing judgement on m&m :  mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong  they just dont give a damn .   this is reminiscent of nietzsches whole philosophy  and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil .  mickey :  the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers .   mickey ( again in his interview ) :  me and you  we are not the same species .   notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control .  mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang .  the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader  no matter who it is .  mickey : how ya feelin ?  wayne : fucking great !  mickey : you got the feelin ?  wayne : im alive .  im alive for the first fuckin time !  what an incredible transformation this is .  he got the feeling and he couldnt contain himself .  what a feeling .  that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe .  mickey when almost caught in a dead end   think  think  think  think .   go figure it out .  dwight ( tommy lee jones ) in general  because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film .  his whole attitude can be summed up with   destroy them ! ! !  
the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches  and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ?  where else would pure escapism  a vulnerable hero  the  talking villains   blatant product placement  predictable action sequences  and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ?  i dont understand it myself  but thats what the bond series is based on .  for ( i think ) 18 films  weve mostly got the same thing over and over again  with some variation ( and a bit of change  most notably in the two dalton films ) .  but even i  a king of cynicism  cant bitch about it .  and  tomorrow never dies   the ( again  i think ) eighteenth bond film  and second brosnan bond film  is no exception .  thank god !  the plot  as in most of them  is pure balderdash  but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it .  instead of just plain billionaire psychotics  we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce  looking bitching with a white-haired cru cut  and always talking like hes out of breath )  who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war .  no  this is not  wag the dog  - he wants a real war  between china and england  and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it . . . in  comes bond .  james is sent all around the world  trying to do research on carver  fighting with his men  and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh  asian action star extraordinaire . . . and  co-star of  supercop   nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one ) .  the two eventually  and predictably of course  begin working together  and yes  there is some sexual tension between the two .  luckily  their relationship is never strained  and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale .  thank god again .  in every bond film  james bags  on average  three women ( sometimes more  sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids-cautionary dalton )  and he doesnt spoil this one ( though we never see them  of course - i mean  they need to stay around a pg-13 rating ) .  theres always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again  the big bond girl ( yeoh )  and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carvers wife  paris  who  it seems  was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning .  yes  teris very attractive  but she seems kind of dull .  of course  its not really her fault ; her part is under-written  and shes only in a small part of it .  oh well .  and there are always the big henchmen  the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains .  this time we get a tall  arian-looking ( not to mention robert shaw in  from russia with love  -looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto )  who is pretty awesome  although a bit stiff ( well  mostly his posture  really ) .  and for a bit of comedy  we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point .  the government people have small parts  as usual  with q ( desmond llewelyn  looking near death  sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual )  and m ( judi dench )  getting more than m usually gets ( i mean  it is judi dench ) .  and for no reason whatsoever  except cause he was so good in  goldeneye   joe don baker shows up again as wade  admitting he has no reason for being there  and is this time more annoying .  again  oh well .  the action sequences are not a let-down  although sometimes go on too long .  they pop up every now and then  mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series )  and some significant ones are the opening one  one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control  and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle  nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam . . . the  plots not really essential ) .  theyre more high-tech  and feature much more laughs  which  yeah  i dig .  so what if theyre distracting ; theyre supposed to be !  the acting  from most around is great .  yeoh is  actually  one of the better bond girls  mainly because shes so unique .  the better bond girls are more independent  and have a certain wily-ness to them .  pussy galore  with her homoerotic undertones and all  is one of the best  and diana rigg  who married bond at the end of  on her majestys secret service  only to be killed  added some emotional depth .  yeoh is notable since shes so active  and has great chemistry with brosnan .  pryce is an awesome villain  being slimy and lovable at the same time .  and brosnan is  once again  the mack daddy .  the bond series is built on cliches  mainly because theyre so fun and add to the escapism .  if you can remember the dalton years  and theyre serious direction  you remember how unsuccessful they were  both financially and aesthetically .  the series would falter if bogged down with too much plot  too many themes  and too much characterization .  i dont really understand it myself  yet im one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states .  having seen all of them more than once ( yes  ive seen this twice already )  you can tell i adore them .  while its not one of the best  like  goldfinger  or  from russia with love    tomorrow never dies  is nonetheless a truly awesome installment  even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones .

john sayles  men with guns  is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power .  the film takes place in an unnamed central american country  where the men with guns are the rulers .  most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns  some are controlled by army soldiers with guns  and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves  bandits  and terrorists .  all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness .  however  like so many central american countries  this one also features modernity .  there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers  hospitals  televisions  highways  etc . but  it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land  or else they are simply ignorant of it .  the films main character  dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category .  one of his patients  an army general  describes him as the most educated man he has ever met  and also the most naive .  fuentes is a true liberal  a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians .  with government assistance  he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate .  this program was to be his legacy  and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea .  however  when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s  he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned .  as he travels deeper into the forest  going from village to village  the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers  usually for helping the other .  when dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors  she replies simply   because they had guns  and we didnt .   rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns  because others sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power .  dr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey  all of whom are characterized by their loss .  first  there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez )  who has neither a mother nor a father .  next  fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado )  who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities .  through his ordeal in the army  domingo has lost most of his self-respect  and defines himself only by his pistol .  along the way  the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar )  a priest who has lost his faith .  as domingo is running from the army  so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer  and ran away from the village in which he was preaching .  last  the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz )  who hasnt spoken since she was raped two years earlier  her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her .  sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in  men with guns .    ( like many of his films  sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room  but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . )  he creates fascinating  complex characters  especially dr . fuentes and domingo .  their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the films overarching theme of violence as power - domingos attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is  but later is isnt ) .  the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself .  sayles knows how to bring a location to life  whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in  matewan  ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in  lone star  ( 1996 ) .  sayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak (  gattaca  ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain .  sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico  using all latin american actors  and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects .  the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief  but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border .  it would not be a stretch to say that  men with guns  is a depressing film .  in fact  the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure .  in addition to loss  the main characters are also failures at something  whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine  or padre portillos inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being .  nevertheless  it is bleak material sayles has chosen  and he deals with it accordingly .  the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope  even in a world where  as one character puts it   nobody refuses the men with guns .  
plot : during a 10-week span in london in the fall of 1888  jack the ripper  a man whose identity was never uncovered  committed five ritualistic  grisly murders of prostitutes .  this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century-old mystery .  critique : awesome !  i love dark movies  i love stylish movies  i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp . . . so  yes  i really dug this movie !  the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance  out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously  and this movie  my friends . . . is  very serious !  in fact  its also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell .  it aint for the kids  ill tell you that much .  and if any of those recent hack directors of two-bit scream-esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective  kill scenes   do not look any further  because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner  especially when compared to their generic slice-and-dice contrivances .  in fact  most of this films structure is very creative  the actors  all solid  the atmosphere and  feel  of the picture  remarkably real ( gotta love those  unfortunates  )  and the descent into darkness  well honed by the filmmakers .  you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time .  but its also an impressive mystery film  based on the true-life tale of jack the ripper  a man whose identity was never discovered .  the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel  from hell  written by alan moore and presents a compelling story  which despite being a little oliver stone-ish  did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely  and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem  sexual depravity  drug usage  insanity  murders and love ?  yes  the brothers even managed to slip a little  love  story in here  and despite not truly being developed  i guess it couldve been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already .  thats right  theres no real need to put any  romance  in a film about a mass murderer !  but that aside  you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp  who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities  to center this movie all the way through .  sure  hes just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow  but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one .  i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film ( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie  but she was fine ) and how little the dreams/fantasies of depps character had to do with the films development ( from what i had seen in the trailer  i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story  but thankfully  it wasnt ) .  on the downside  the film doesnt really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development .  but then again  a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all-time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement .  i mean  the less i knew about each person  the more suspicious i became of each ones motives  reasons  etc . . .  in fact  i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end  and that was in part  due to the distance to which id been held from the films characters . . . or  am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention ?  perhaps .  overall  this is an extremely creepy production  with glorious cinematography ( reminiscent of coppolas dracula and burtons sleepy hollow )  a grim score and solid acting .  but its not for everyone .  some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events  and even though the murders arent shown as graphically as you might think  theres enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors .  but i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable  gothic atmosphere  and this flick is just that and plenty more !  and god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the rippers haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon . . . brrrrr !  wheres joblo coming from ?  the crow ( 9/10 ) - dark city ( 9/10 ) - dracula ( 7/10 ) - jfk ( 9/10 ) - the nightmare before christmas ( 10/10 ) - the ninth gate ( 8/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - quills ( 8/10 ) - shadow of the vampire ( 6/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 ) 
in `enemy at the gates  jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov ( joseph fiennes ) who uses him in a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad .  its world war ii  and the russian-german standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland .  laws vassili is the russians top pawn to victory .  lots of war stuff happens .  an older  german version of judes character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings .  hes equally talented  and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other .  they constantly switch roles  as the war fades far into the background .  the cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili and danilov  the set-up is decent  and so are the production values .  boasting a wide range of grimy locales  greasy hair  and tattered costumes  the art direction prospers .  the actors  however  suffer the problem matt damon had in `saving private ryan .  either their eyes  teeth  skin  or a combination of other features looked too white and clean .  with dirt and blood all around  the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action .  that said  the players are mostly good in their roles  although i dont think ed harris was really trying .  maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in one-notedom .  while the film is technically about snipers  there are far too many predictable sniping scenes .  director jean-jacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting  but after about the sixth time  in which we realize that jude is not going to die  its relatively pointless .  we get that hes talented  okay  lets move on .  thats the problem with `enemy at the gates ; it just doesnt know when to stop .  witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere .  reestablishing his title as the most beautiful ( and often talented ) man on film  jude law carries the movie .  without him  this costly production would have gone into the ground .  the story and acting are of good quality  but theres never a sense of authenticity or reality .  something about this war movie is undeniably modern  and it loses its feeling .  strange enough  the screenplay is based on the true story of a real russian sniper . 
its been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller  where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters  but its been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters  not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles  flaws  and strengths to emerge so radiantly .  id saw that its been at least a couple decades  even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers  though im hardly comparing  a simple plan  to  say   rear window  or  strangers on a train .   yet its almost as good .  its simple  yet strangely complex  and astonishingly rewarding  because instead of moving from plot point to plot point  and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones  it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to  all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral .  elegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes  the same )   a simple plan  concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright  moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton )  his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton )  and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) .  without anyone around  and the possibility that no one would come looking for it  the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes  they will keep it  but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking  and so they generally dont flaunt anything they dont want to flaunt  theyll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton .  the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners  who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves .    a simple plan   though borrows a little from each of these .  a little tiff with the cops here  a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there )  and a bit of inside feuding over here .  but  as austin powers would say  thats not necessarily its bag ( baby ) .  what i most admired about this film  and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that its successfully able to have its cake and eat it too .  it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches  like the ones mentioned above  but at the same time  it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag .  so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up  and these subsequent steps go miserably awry  the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to  they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity .  in one early scene  paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesnt look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea )  when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie )  and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) .  instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing  raimi shows a lengthy  painful shot from a low-angle onto paxtons face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion .  theres a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder hes committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective  but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching .  in short  probably the best piece of direction raimis ever done  demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof  watch  persona  s  sex scene  and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergmans ever done ) .  but the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof .  yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story .  when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife  played by bridget fonda  a pal to raimi )  he does  and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights .  theres at least two grand shootouts  and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history  and when they arrive  they dont come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror .  during the one  i was actually sinking into my chair  with the mantra  they cant do this  can they ?   streeming through my head .  in fact  this film  which is getting many comparisons to the coens [superior  but forget about it]  fargo   has many similar moments of manic insanity  attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what  in other hands  would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine  i suppose  robert rodriguez directing this . . . then  again  after seeing the  evil dead  films  id hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off  although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed  raimi  moments  a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) .  instead  raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch  easily letting the story and characters co-exist  while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out  like some offbeat comic touches .  most particularly  billy bob thorntons character  jacob  is a brilliant creation .  his dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film  every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter )  but theres authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that were not totally laughing at him .  the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real .  jacobs a multi-dimensional character  and while being stupid  we see that as not so much a flaw  but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system  primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money .  the final third of the film spends much time with him  and many of the touches upon his character  not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book  by the way ) are just great .  i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend  told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character .  thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance  by far the best performance hes ever given and further proof that hes the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you dont believe me  go back and watch his wonderful performance in  primary colors   a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadnt been in the same year ) because hes easily able to slip into a character  and make him completely and utterly believable .  he brings so much weight to the film that  as it is with most character actors  its difficult picturing anyone else in the role .  the rest of the cast is great too  from paxtons declining working man to chelcie ross amiable town sheriff .  even fonda shows off her talents nicely .  and if i had any complaints about the film  its that the plot is almost too simplistic  and that at times  it seems too much like an exercise  like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved .  and the occasional narration is  as it usually is  annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution  especially when youre trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didnt raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) .  and  the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie  the ending is basically amiss .  i wont reveal it  but its way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up  as if the appearance of a plane wasnt already too much of that anyway .  for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved  this is the wrong ending .  imagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise  its like if in  crime and punishment  if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that im at all comparing  a simple plan  to dostoevsky .  the ending does work  despite my protestations  but to me  there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it  then just ignore me and go about your day .  but despite my mere claims  make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout  and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured  not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is  thankfully for this  very minimal )  but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that ive frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile .  at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . 
some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies .  that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find  to their big surprise  that the majority of people vote republican  go to church every sunday and usually dont tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film .  such rude awakening  however  can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in .  something like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott )  successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community .  one day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california .  van dorn is worried because he doesnt believe that his daughter would run from home .  however  the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film .  infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way masts investigation is going  so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself .  unfortunately  he lacks experience and the quest  that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld  is fruitless .  things change when he devises cunning plan and  while doing it  stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) .  almost two decades after its release  hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars .  it is a real shame  because very few movies in todays hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt .  in late 1970s  it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature  serious themes for the mature audience .  for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work  taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s .  on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great .  but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and  instead of facing them  prefers to live in rural  conservative cocoons .  the new america  on the other hand  fares no better - ideals of the so-called  sexual revolution   same as all other  revolutions  of the swinging sixties  degraded into exploitation and depravity .  instead of being  liberated   baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms .  schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas  actually  arent so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn  already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist  meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian  paternalistic and very dedicated to this job .  the difference between the two is simply in the line of work .  many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda .  on the surface  it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest .  in the first scenes  he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesnt deserve to experience parents worst nightmare .  the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristens fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation  brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott  is of such intensity  that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda .  van dorn is perhaps flawed  and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just  and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body .  on the other hand  schrader  who grew up in an environment very much like van dorns ( his own parents wouldnt allow him to watch movies until he was 18 )  knows better and tries to bring another side of coin .  even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky  who actually tries to improve her life  and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end .  unfortunately  schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning  and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale .  the script is slightly flawed  and schrader as director doesnt show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver .  apart from the scenes in grand rapids  those two films even look alike .  but the content might be more than interesting for todays viewer  especially those inspired by the current 70s revival .  until boogie nights  no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s .  hardcore  on the other hand  might serve as precious document  because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video  when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists .  the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering  though  but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience  that shouldnt be too surprising .  anyway  despite some flaws  hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema . 
vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element  substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject  but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents .  and  unlike any of the more outlandish myths  the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1  000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide  and places 50 in los angeles ) .  but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys  john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre .  and remind us he does in his latest film  vampires .  there was some question  as halloween weekend approached  of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinemas immensely successful blade  released in august .  the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue  and dont even agree on some basic points of the slaying method .   ( for instance  blades main weapons are silver and garlic  whereas main character jack crows technique is a wooden stake to the heart . )  blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization  while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate .  both have their advantages  and here  carpenters style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered .  when its all said and done  though  the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum .  this time  our hero is vatican-sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods ) .  hes a cynical  battle-worn veteran  and the best of his bunch .  he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest  and after exterminating a nest one night  they run up against a super-vampire ( termed a  master  ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith ) .  valek kills all of jacks team except for his partner  tony montoya ( daniel baldwin )  and as the two regroup  they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old .  apparently  valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime .  so with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait  they track valek down for the final confrontation .  the script for vampires  written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel  is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year .  crow  in particular  is a fun source of one-liners  and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism .  baldwin  lee  and guinee are all fine supports  adding to the character pool  but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffiths bad guy .  griffiths intense expression is perfect for the role  and the only downside is that hes got to talk sometime .  luckily  hes got few lines  and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance .  all said  fans will surely be impressed by this picture  and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one .  certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters . 
if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue  we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia .  although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way  like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelles high school reunion )  some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones .  until that happens  1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed  when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel  materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters .  contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times .  one of such movies  one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen  is william friedkins to live and die in l . a .  the money isnt just the symbolic motive in the film  it is the major elements of the plot .  rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps  and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career  masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected .  richard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent  adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters .  however  his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another .  finally he sets up a final sting  but his superiors deny him the necessary money .  being frustrated  and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow )  he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier .  their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent  but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway .  like french connection  one of his previous masterpieces  this friedkins movie was inspired by real life .  gerrald petievich  author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay  spent many years working as a secret service agent .  that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency  not much utilised by hollywood .  secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movies hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagans speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times .  ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie .  willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath  whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesnt seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary  those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable .  compared with him  and all the other side characters that want their  piece of the action   two heroes on the side of law seem like losers .  instead of being a classical good guy  secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick  who should serve as those  better judgement  is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end .  in such surroundings of moral decay  the not so happy  yet surprising ending doesnt seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) .  the dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkins directing skills .  the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro  dean stockwell  debra feuer  darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase .  that scene alone  with lot of realism  thrills and surprise twists  is worth seeing the rest of the film .  the soundtrack  provided by now almost forgotten band  wang chung   is also one of the more memorable of that decade .  in every case  to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it . 
jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u . s . s .  enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960s series  star trek .  gone are kirk  spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation .  as usual  a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again .  this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f . murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonists will .  it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists .  of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong  so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists .  insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films .  the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group .  in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction .  it doesnt do a bad job  other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line .  many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes  while many of the others just fall flat .  the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense .  there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet  why do they have to be moved ?  the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abrahams aliens who number only a couple of dozen .  so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion  at least thats plausible .  but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen  which makes no sense whatsoever .  the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn )  the trusty klingon .  worf was on star trek : the next generation  so they want to include him in the films .  no problem so far .  worf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine  so the writers have to find a way to have him show up .  in the last star trek movie  first contact  the included worf in a credible fashion  in this one  the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie .  what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you werent hanging on every word on the screen .  my minor problems with the movie aside  star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones .  while many of the jokes do miss the mark  many are pretty good  even for non-trekkies .  the special effects are among the best for the star trek series .  the action is plentiful and well done .  this is a very good-looking movie .  it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate .  it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade .  they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster .  most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series .  if youve always hated star trek  there is nothing here that is going to change your mind .  star trek : insurrection is not the best film in the series  but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones .
